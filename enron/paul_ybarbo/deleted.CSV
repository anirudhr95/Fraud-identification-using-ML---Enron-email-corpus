BSES moves ministry over Enron's stake in DPC, S Ravindran 

After a series of flip flops, power major BSES has formally communicated to the Union government that it is interested in buying out Enron's stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). It has, however, added the now-familiar rider that the capital cost of the project should be brought down. BSES chairman and managing director R V Shahi said, ""We have formally told the ministries of power, finance and financial institutions Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI and the State Bank of India that we are interested in the project. The communication was despatched last Saturday."" Shahi also said that a financial re-engineering of the $3 billion, 2,184-mw power project was necessary so that the cost of power was affordable. 

Analysts, however, queried the seriousness of BSES's intentions in view of the various conflicting statements made earlier by Shahi. He has made public statements that the company is interested in the project but has denied them in communications to the Bombay Stock Exchange. Sources familiar with an earlier round of discussions with Enron say that BSES had offered to buy the equity at a 90 per cent discount. This would have meant BSES paying only around $120 million for the 85 per cent stake that Enron and its two US partners -- General Electric and Bechtel -- hold in the company. The three partners have so far invested around $1.2 billion in the project. Tata Power managing director Adi J Engineer insisted that the company was still interested in the Dabhol project. ""We have not held any serious discussions on the issue in the last fortnight but discussions will resume shortly. There is no roadblock and the final outcome will depend upon the sacrifices willing to be made by all the stokeholders in the project,"" he said. Engineer refused to divulge further details. The lenders to the project have mooted a three-pronged formula for the sale of power from the Dabhol power project. The entire power from the 740-mw first phase of the project should be bought by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. Half the power from the 1,444-mw second phase will be bought by the central government utility, National Thermal Power Corporation, while the other half will be sold within Maharahstra for which a dedicated region will be allotted to Tata Power.

Maha to challenge London court order on DPC

THE MAHARASHTRA government has decided to challenge the injunction order issued by the commercial court in London restraining the state from filing suits against the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in India. The DPC had obtained the injunction on October11. ""The state government has decided to challenge the order as we feel that the concerned court should have heard the state as well. Within a week we would be presenting our case,"" the state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said here on Wednesday. The ex-parte order relates to arbitration proceedings between the state government and DPC with respect to state guarantee, state support and supplemental state support agreements. It prevented the state government from taking any legal action in India, challenging the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. Mr Deshmukh today also reiterated his government's resolve not to draw electricity from DPC. ""There is no logic in buying DPC power at higher rate and selling it with much lower rates,"" Deshmukh said. According to Deshmukh, due to recent rainfall, the demand for electricity has gone down considerably and the state electricity board is supplying power without interruption. Meanwhile, the government today expressed its resolve to initiate a judicial probe into the entire Enron deal. ""The probe would begin in few weeks ,"" Deshmukh said. The state has already requested the Chief Justice of the Mumbai High Court to appoint a judge for the probe.

GAIL keen on Dabhol LNG terminal project, Balaji C. Mouli 

GAS Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) has written to both the Petroleum Ministry and the Power Ministry evincing interest in the 5 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa) LNG regassification terminal of the Dabhol Power Company, according to Government officials. In a recent communique to the two Ministries, it has asked the financial institutions to set up a meeting to enable it review the financial details of the LNG project. The financial data on the LNG project solely rests with Bechtel, GE and Enron.As a first step towards examining the financial data, GAIL will require to enter into a confidentiality clause agreement with the present project sponsors to access the data.

Meanwhile, the financial institutions are awaiting the results of political parleys between the Centre and the Maharashtra Government towards bringing the latter into a `solution finding' mode to implement a financial restructuring package and resolve the Dabhol crisis. Once this is done, the FIs will freeze the financial package - involving sacrifices undertaken by the present stakeholders - and again elicit market response towards bettering the Tatas' proposition. Although the FIs had earlier scouted the market and found only the Tatas evincing interest in the project, it would again offer the Dabhol project to the market to ensure that the concessions on the part of the State are not awarded on a nomination basis.The foreign lenders have pointed out that they would not be agreeable to the domestic FIs spearheading the salvage operation finally resulting in transfer of ownership of the power plant. Hence, the Government is mulling a high-level committee to implement the process leading to transfer of ownership.

NCP to be blamed (Letters to the Editor)

Sir, - Mr. Prem Shankar Jha's article `Dabhol and the do nothing Government' (Oct. 16) is interesting. The blame for the present situation should squarely rest on the NCP Government in Maharashtra. The Congress, to square points with Mr. Pawar, has created problems in implementing the second phase. With 90 per cent work complete, it is not in the national interest to give it up at this stage. It is time the Prime Minister devoted some attention to resolving the issue. The Centre should ask the NTPC to take over the responsibility of running this unit by providing financial help. The Government should sit with the DPC and settle for a final takeover and finish the work and start generating power.

Govt rejects Coke's plea on waiving IPO 

Government said today that it would not accede to Coca-Cola's request for exemption from mandatory divestment of equity, as this would be tantamount to 'favouritism'. ""It (the agreement signed between Coca-Cola and the government of India at the time of company's entry) won't be changed. They wanted it to be changed, but this can't be for a particular company. It will amount to favouritism,"" Commerce and Industry Minister Murasoli Maran told reporters here.Replying to a query at the Annual Economic Editors' Conference on whether government could reconsider Coca-Cola's proposal, he said ""MoU norms are the same for everybody. These cannot be changed for one single company.

Mr Maran also dismissed dispute surrounding Enron's Dabhol Power project as isolated, saying such cases were unlikely to affect Foreign Direct Investment inflows into India. ""Enron is only an isolated incident... There are many success stories on FDI front,"" Mr Maran said, adding even the Enron issue was not closed and negotiations were on to resolve the crisis. He said Enron's Dabhol Power Project was financed by domestic institutions to the extent of up to 80 per cent and this was a matter of concern for the country. Government is yet to communicate its decision on the Coke's request for waiver of 49 per cent disinvestment from it Indian holding or alternatively a five year moratorium till July, 2007.
 
Asked about reports that the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had allowed a moratorium, Industry Secretary Govindrajan told PTI ""we have not communicated any decision to the company so far."" Coke has cited mounting losses, which have wiped out its networth by a whopping 66 per cent on Rs 3,200 crore investment since 1993 in Indian operations, as the main reason for seeking disinvestment waiver.Company officials had earlier claimed that the Indian venture would strive to break even during the current financial year with Rs 4,000 crore turnover target but will take some more time to wipe out the accumulated losses. A 66 per cent erosion in networth means devaluation in the book value of Coke's 10-rupee share by the same proportion, a situation unacceptable for a company which claims numero uno position in the Indian soft drinks market.

DPC board to meet in London on Nov 30, Sanjay Jog
...expected to authorise Wade Cline to issue final termination notice to MSEB

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is involved in the process of selling its stakes in the distressed Dabhol project, has reconvened its board meeting on November 30 in London, for authorising Enron India managing director K Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). The MSEB and state government, which have a representation on the DPC board, are likely to skip the ensuing board meeting. The DPC, following the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc and the Bombay High Court's order of November 9 restraining it from serving a final termination notice to MSEB until further order, had cancelled the board meeting originally slated for November 19 in Houston. The MSEB, which holds 30 per cent equity in the Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw), had taken a serious objection of the November 19 meeting and had asked DPC to cancel it following the Bombay High Court order. Curiously, MSEB has decided to soon send a dissent note to the DPC saying that the stage of issuing final termination notice had come mainly because of DPC's mismanagement. 

MSEB, which wants to expose DPC's default on the availability of power, in its dissent note would also ask the DPC to change the venue of the board meeting from London to India. MSEB sources told The Financial Express on Thursday that it has received an intimation from DPC on the proposed board meeting to be held in London. Sources said that it would ask DPC why it suddenly cancelled the Houston meeting and rescheduled it for November 30. MSEB is also likely to question the ""wasteful expenditure"" involved in the cancellation and reorganisation of the board meeting especially when DPC has been complaining about a financial crunch faced by it, following the closure of the Dabhol project after the suspension of power by MSEB on May 29. MSEB would also pointed out that though there were slippages in the payment of its power purchase bills, it has paid it with interest. Ironically, DPC, which defaulted on the availability of power, refused to accept the April bill and neither paid the rebate imposed by MSEB for material misrepresentation and default. The November 30 meeting would also take up issues related to assess preservation, 12 months preservation, financial position of DPC with regard to Dabhol Phase-I, failure in the payment of interest to lenders. The meet would also hold discussion on safeguarding the legal positions of DPC directors, opening of letter of credit of $295 million for shipping. If DPC fails to do so there is a likelihood that it may lose the ship arranged for the supply liquified natural gas. 

Mumbai, Nov 22: Dynegy Inc spokesperson John Sousa has said that Enron-owned assets especially the 2,184 mw Dabhol project would continue to be managed by Enron through the closing of merger, which is expected to be complete in the second or third quarter of 2002.  ""We are currently beginning the Dynegy-Enron merger integration process. Assets currently owned by Enron will continue to be managed by Enron through the closing of our merger, which is expected in 6 to 9 months,"" he said.

Arbitrators meet in Singapore on Dabhol 

OFFICIALS of the Maharashtra Government and Dabhol Power Company officials will meet on November 24 at Singapore for ``preliminary discussions'' on international arbitration proceedings initiated against the State. Officials are expected to brief the panel of arbitrators about the issues involved in the arbitration process, sources said. The preliminary meeting in Singapore will be followed by the actual arbitration process in the London Court. Enron-promoted DPC had initiated arbitration against the State Government accusing breach of contract. The company had accused the Government of not honouring its guarantees and supplemental support guarantees by refusing to pay the amount due for December and January bills issued by DPC on the MSEB after the board refused to pay the bills. Officials are expected to request the panel comprising Mr Quinton Loh (nominated by the State Government), Mr Andrew Rogers (DPC nominee) and Lord Mustell (independent arbitrator) to suspend proceedings. The officials may ask the panel to wait till the State replied the injunction order passed by the Commercial Court in London last month, on the same issue, sources said. The Commercial Court had passed an ex parte order against the State Government restraining it from taking any legal action against international arbitration initiated by DPC.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Friday, November 23, 2001
NGO pegs DPC cost at Rs 1,500 cr 

The Prayas Energy Group, a research-oriented NGO, has pegged the cost of the Dabhol project at Rs 1,500 crore ($320 million). This figure contrasts sharply with the estimate of Rs 3,800 crore ($800 million) reported to be under consideration by Indian financial institutions. The NGO recently evaluated the project's worth following news reports about the Dabhol Power Company selling the stake of its three MNC promoters -Enron, General Electric and Bechtel -for about $ 800 million, after a 30 per cent discounting.

According to Prayas, if Enron is not willing to settle for a reasonable figure, the Indian financial institutions may come under pressure to absorb the difference to put a full- stop to the endless rounds of controversy the project has been attracting. ``This is evident in the proposals being discussed, envisaging that the FIs would buy the equity as a warehouse and sell it later. The loss would obviously be theirs,'' says Shantanu Dixit, one of the researchers for the group. ``Based on our analysis of the renegotiation committee's report of 1995, the affidavit by the then chief minister Manohar Joshi in August 1996 in the Bombay high court, and the present financing structure of the project, it could be concluded that the fair cost of equity of the foreign promoters is not more than $320 million (Rs 1,500 crore),'' he says. This estimate is based on the assumption that DPC completes the project in the next six months, without any additional loans. Giving a break-up of the estimate, a statement released by the Prayas mentions that in the detailed project report submitted to the Central Electricity Authority in 1993, Enron has claimed a capital cost of US $ 2,828 million. Following re-negotiations in 1996, the Shiv Sena-BJP government claimed this cost had been pared down to U.S. $2,500 million. This is mentioned on Page 3 of the re-negotiation committee's report, which says that ``Enron and DPC representatives have given their written consent'' to this reduction.

But, by 1999, DPC's cumulative loans from Indian and foreign institutions were nearly $2,050 million. This implies that the total equity component of the project is only $450 million. Of this, the equity of Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) is $130 million. This brings the total equity put in by the foreign promoters to about $320 million. The report points out that on several occasions, Enron has guaranteed completion of the project within the agreed cost. ``Hence, any equity claim higher than this amount is unjustified and need not be entertained,'' it says. ``In other words, buying the foreign promoter's stake for a price more than $320 million would amount to a paying a premium to Enron and not discount,'' observes Mr Dixit.

The report notes that just before the work on the project was suspended owing to the disputes between the MSEB and the DPC, DPC had said the project cost had escalated and it would complete the project at a cost of $3,326 million. ``This astonishing cost overrun of $826 million (or 33 per cent of the project cost) is unbelievable, and has to be the result of Enron's inefficiency,'' says Mr Dixit. It further hiked this figure to $3,690 million, citing cost overruns since the project was not completed as per schedule. This, despite the fact that a few months before the suspension of work, DPC had claimed that more than 90 per cent of the project was complete. It has now claimed additional costs of $360 million, that is 14 per cent cost overrun for completion of the project.

The cumulative difference is of $1,190 million or a cost increase of Rs 5,500 crore, says the report. Now, if this difference has to be accounted for in any new power purchase agreement that may be worked out in the future, it would come in for scrutiny by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission. ``There is every likelihood that the MERC would disallow it since it overrides the mutually agreed figure of $2,500 million,'' says Mr Dixit. In that case, the relevant party -most probably the government or the financial institutions -would willy-nilly have to absorb the additional costs claimed and incur such a needless and huge loss, he says.

'Enron may sell Dabhol at half price' , WASHINGTON

EMBATTLED US power major Enron may be forced to sell its stake in the Dabhol power plant at around half a billion dollars instead of the asking price of a billion dollars, a report here said. Tata Power and BSES, the Indian bidders for Enron's stake in the 2184 mw Dhabol Power Plant were reportedly willing to pay only half of the asking price which stood over a billion dollars, the New York Times reported. If the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take it or leave it line, Enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project which one gleamed with promise, it said. ""It is bound to be a distress sale,"" one banker told the paper. Though Enron's chairman and chief executive Kenneth L Lay was earlier quoted as saying that India would have to face economic sanctions if the government did not create a favourable climate for the sale of Enron's stake, the paper said ""Enron now will find little lobbying traction in either Washington or New Delhi"". ""The coalition-building diplomacy of the war in Afghanistan makes it unlikely that the Bush administration would agree to press India on Enron's behalf,"" the paper said.( PTI )

SEES SOLUTION BY MID-DECEMBER; OPERATORSHIP JV OPTION THROWN UP
BG extends Panna Mukta deal with Enron, Sourav Majumdar

British Gas (BG), which has decided to acquire the 30 per cent stake held by Enron in the Panna Mukta Tapti oil and gas fields for about $388 million, has extended the deal indefinitely, pinning its hopes on getting sole operatorship rights for the fields by mid-December. The deal to buy the stake is conditional upon BG getting the operatorship rights which were with Enron, and was supposed to have been clinched by October end. BG is now hoping that the issue will be sorted out by the middle of next month. The other joint venture partners in the Panna Mukta Tapti fields are Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) with a 40 per cent stake, and Reliance with another 30 per cent. Both ONGC and Reliance have also staked claim to the operatorship rights.But even as BG holds firm on getting sole operatorship, two other options have been thrown up. 

One option is that of setting up a joint venture operatorship company with the three joint venture partners holding stakes reflecting their ownership of the mother venture.The other option is to hand over one field each to each of the three joint venture partners. However, for BG, it's still a ""sole operatorship or nothing"" approach. While BG India chief Nigel Shaw was not available for comment, sources close to BG in India confirmed to The Financial Express that the deal had been extended in view of the hopes that the entire issue would be amicably resolved by the middle of December. ""For BG, the stance is clear: it wants sole operatorship rights,"" the sources said.

They said the operatorship issue was critical to the running of the fields, and, therefore, there was no question of continuing with it unless BG got the rights. On the other hand, petroleum minister Ram Naik is of the view that merely because Enron is selling its stake to BG, it does not mean the rights can be transferred automatically to the new buyer. Mr Naik had earlier said that the right of first refusal for operatorship rights was with the other two partners in the joint venture. ONGC's unions have also backed the corporation's claim to operatorship rights, saying that it has enormous experience in the field and had also discovered the fields. Reliance, on the other hand, staked its claim citing experience and also the fact that it has got 25 blocks in NELP I,II and III.

According to sources associated with the entire issue, the joint venture operatorship company had come up as a suggested solution to the operatorship tangle from some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners could be kept in the picture. If this was not feasible, the other suggestion was to distribute the three fields to the three partners. ""That way, there would be some benchmarking possible as each partner would then operate one block,"" sources said. BG, however, is not willing to concede anything less than sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has just been taken over by Dynegy Inc., had already decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as part of its global strategy. The US energy major was keen to move quickly on the Panna Mukta Tapti front, since it was already locked in intense deliberations on another of its major Indian assets, the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC).

Enron shares in quicksand as merger doubts rise, C BRYSON HULL

Enron Corporation said on Wednesday it secured the remaining $450 million of a new $1 billion credit line, but the news did little to reassure investors it can stay afloat long enough to complete its merger with rival Dynegy Inc. Shares of the Houston-based energy giant were off 26per cent, despite the announcement in which Enron also said it had pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million debt to mid-December from a deadline of next Tuesday. Enron's shares fell 23 per cent on Tuesday, after it raised credit concerns in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""The Dynegy deal will take a long time and a lot of things could happen over that time period. Dynegy did their homework, but if they missed anything, they have a number of exit opportunities,"" said Fulcrum Global Partners analyst Michael Barbis. In Wednesday's statement, Enron said it is in feverish talks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to the Dynegy deal, tagged at $9 billion in stock.""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" Enron chairman and chief executive Ken Lay said. Enron's shares were down $1.83, or 26 per cent, at $5.16 on Wednesday afternoon. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for the second day in a row.

Shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebounding somewhat after the announcement of the new loan. Accounting for stock splits, that is the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1.95, or 4.68 per cent, at $39.75. Dynegy chairman and chief executive officer Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new $450 million loan and the debt extension for the $690 million. ""We are continuing our confirmatory due diligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement,"" he said in a statement. Watson said Chevron Texaco, which owns 26 per cent of Dynegy, reiterated its 'full confidence in Dynegy's disciplined management approach to complete the merger and to build a new company into an industry leader.' 

Privately, analysts were calling the odds of a successful merger lower in the wake of new negative news made in a US Securities and Exchange filing. Most analysts called the chances of success even, where most had called the odds of success at 60-70 per cent earlier. Wall Street analysts said Enron is losing market share because of credit concerns from its trading partners and questions over Dynegy Inc's takeover offer. ""Enron is definitely losing market share on credit concerns. Cash needs to run the business have now increased. The market perceives Enron as needing more cash,"" said Barbis. Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform on Tuesday, and took both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dynegy - $1.5 billion - 'appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron customers.' The bad news in Monday's filing with the SEC included the acceleration of the $690 million debt because of the credit downgrade, a new reduction in third-quarter earnings, word that Enron has only about $1.5 billion cash on hand after new infusions of $5.5 billion over the past few weeks and an admission that trading volumes had dropped.

EU urged to ease market access, NEW YORK, ( carried only by the online edition)

ENRON Corp, the beleaguered energy trading company, plans to use its minority interests in power plants to secure a restructured $690 million loan agreement, a source familiar with the plan said. The Houston-based Enron, which has agreed to be bought by rival Dynegy Inc in a stock-swap merger, disclosed in regulatory filings on Monday that it needed to provide collateral for the loan by November 27 or pay it off at an accelerated rate due to a recent ratings downgrade. This week, Citigroup Inc, which arranged the original $690 million loan, worked with the nearly 20 other banks to extend the payment schedule to mid-December, the source added. Discussions on repricing the loan are continuing, but the rate is likely to be similar to the terms of a new $1 billion line of credit for Enron, details of which Enron disclosed here. Enron said it secured the remaining $450 million in credit for this previously announced $1 billion line. The loan was lead by Citibank, which is advising Enron in its merger with Dynegy through its Salomon Smith Barney brokerage, and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, which is also advising Enron on its merger with Dynegy. 

Worries over a possible default on the $690-million loan and Enron's ability to fund payments on its looming debt are part of the reason Enron's stock skidded on Tuesday and Wednesday. Enron needs to repay about $9 billion in loans by the end of next year, according to regulatory filings. A lot of the banks were concerned, but all liquidity events can be dealt with a little patience,"" the source said. ""I don't think there is too much risk of a default."" Citibank arranged the original $690 million ""special purpose vehicle"" loan facility to finance Enron's investments in stakes in power businesses, both domestic and internationally. Reviewing operations in Japan: Enron Corp, which has seen its share price fall to a decade low, is reviewing its operations in Japan, including an option to sell the business to a third party, a spokeswoman at Enron's Japanese unit in Tokyo said. Japanese media said the Enron group, facing financial difficulties and frustrated by the slow progress of Japan's liberalisation of its power market, was considering withdrawing from the local market. Japanese energy companies have also been hurt by increased competition and slow demand due to the weak economy. ""Enron Corp is reviewing its operations in Japan...considering every possibility including retaining the operations or selling a part of it,"" the spokeswoman said. The company will likely finalise its plans within five or six weeks, she said. Enron gained its first foothold in Japan in 1999, when it established affiliate E Power Corp, hoping to benefit from Japan's deregulation of the retail market.

BSES to complete DPC due diligence by January

BSES Ltd will begin due diligence of the 2,184 mw Dabhol power project in a fortnight. The process, aimed at assessing the right price for buying 85 per cent stake in the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's (DPC), will be completed by January. Speaking to reporters on Monday, BSES chairman and managing director RV Shahi said, ""The due diligence process will take six to eight weeks after signing of the confidentiality agreement."" According to Mr Shahi, his company would be signing the confidentiality agreement, a pre-requisite for beginning due diligence, in another ten days. BSES has sent its comments on various clauses of the agreement to DPC. The company would appoint three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence of the $2.9-billion project, he said on the sidelines of a seminar on natural gas. 

It would also be constituting an internal task force for doing parallel ground work. The whole exercise would involve assessing the value of DPC's assets and liabilities besides finding out further investment needed to complete the 1,444 mw Phase-II. Stating that the Dabhol power project as its stands was not viable, Mr Shahi said that BSES will be going in for financial re-engineering and renegotiation of the gas supply agreement for Phase-II before taking over the project. DPC had signed a 20 year contract with Oman LNG for 1.6 million tonnes per year and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquification Company for 480,000 tonnes. He said the total cost of power generation has to be brought down to Rs 2.60-2.70 per unit for making it viable. For this fuel cost and capital cost has to be brought down, he added. BSES has shown interest in acquiring 85 per cent stake of Enron, Bechtel and GE in the Dabhol project at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by the Indian financial institutions. It will fix a price for taking over the stake once due dilligence is completed. After signing the confidentiality agreement BSES will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and other assets and legal wrangles. Before taking any decision on the acquisition price of the distressed company.

Maharshtra stand on Enron is vindicated, Seema Mustafa 

The Maharashtra government's refusal to accept Enron's claim of bringing in capital cost of $2.8 billion into the controversial Dabhol Power Corporation has been vindicated by reports of large-scale fraudulent practices by the company in the United States. At present under inquiry by the US Stock Exchange Commission, Enron has been virtually wiped out with Dynegy, a Chevron and Texaco company, having reportedly bought Enron for a paltry $9.12 billion stock swap. Enron's share value plummeted from $90 last year to $7 this month following disclosures that its senior officials had been transferring funds to their own pri vate companies without reflecting this in the balance sheets for the last five years. Enron's chief financial officer was found involved in the scam and was sacked, although this move could not save the company, which has been unable to explain the big gap in its balance sheets. It is reported to have gone down taking $72 billion in shareholders' wealth with it. In fact, the President and CEO of Halliburton, Mr Dave Lesar, is on record as saying that Enron's ""credibility is finished because they did not provide financial information and, therefore, investor confidence declined."" Halliburton claims to be the world's largest provider of products and services to petrol and energy industries, functioning in 120 countries with US vice-president Dick Cheney being the earlier CEO of the company. 

The UK, following the expose, has brought Enron's Wessex Water operations in the country under scrutiny with the entire range of utility and energy assets being given a close look. Pressure is being exerted on the Maharashtra government now to ensure that the records are opened and the entire deal investigated. Mr Probir Purkayastha of the Delhi Science Forum, which had led a major campaign against the Enron power project here, said the US company has survived entirely ""on energy trading and influence brokering."" It had extremely close contacts with the Republican party, including former President George Bush. 

There was tremendous pressure on India to withdraw its objections and clear the project, particularly after the Bush administration assumed power. The new US ambassador to India, Mr Robert Blackwill, is on record saying that India-US relations could be summed up in just five alphabets: ""Enron."" In fact, shortly after assuming office in New Delhi, the ambassador addressed several business and corporate meetings and pushed for the quick clearance of the stalled Enron project. The Maharashtra government, which had cancelled the seven-year-old power purchase agreement with Enron, was in the middle of court proceedings with the company. It is now expected to resume discussions with Dynegy, although it is in a position to ensure that all records are made available and the project thoroughly investigated. Enron's capital cost claim, despite the fact that it was not supported by statistics, was accepted by the state government under the then chief minister, Mr Sharad Pawar. 

Enron went ahead with the construction of Phase I. In 1995, the Shiv Sena-BJP government cancelled the project. Within six months the same government revived it. The government claimed that this was because Enron had agreed to reduce the capital cost to $2.5 billion. But, as was pointed out by the Opposition parties here and has been accepted by the state government now, the Dabhol Power Corporation had borrowed at least $2.05 billion from Indian and foreign institutions, with the result that the total equity component was actually only $450 million. Of this the Maharashtra State Electricity Board had put in $130 million as its own equity, thus, leaving only $320 million equity put in by Enron.

MSEB seeks refund of Rs 1,200 cr from DPC, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) on Monday appealed to the Bombay High Court that Dabhol Power Company (DPC) be ordered to pay it an amount of Rs 1,200 crore towards the excess payment of capacity charges during May 1999 and April 2001. According to MSEB, of the total payment of Rs 3,499 crore towards the power purchases, the capacity charge amounted to Rs 2,087 crore. The average purchasing rate per unit of Dabhol Phase-I (740 mw) power in 2000-01 has been about Rs 7.30 while its payment for the Phase-II (if and when commissioned) would have been in the range of Rs 500 crore per month. 

MSEB has denied that it has failed or neglected to make payments to DPC under the power purchase agreement (PPA) from time to time and whenever the payments were made after the due dates, interest was paid to DPC. ""It is DPC that has defaulted in paying the rebate due to MSEB for the default and material misrepresentation on the availability of power without any basis whatsoever. The DPC's refusal to pay/adjust the rebate in terms of the express provision of the PPA of undisputed facts is obdurate and wrongful,"" it said. 

MSEB in its counter affidavit has prayed that DPC's writ petition challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adjudicate upon dispute and difference between MSEB and DPC be dismissed at cost. The Bombay High Court division bench comprising justices Ajit Shah and Sharad Bobde would begin hearing on the DPC's writ petition from December 11 following the Supreme Court's order of August 6 to settle the MERC jurisdiction issue. The filing of counter affidavit by MSEB today coincides with the completion of six months period after the issuance of two preliminary termination notices by DPC on May 19. DPC, which has already issued another two preliminary termination notices to MSEB on September 10 however, has been restrained from serving a final termination notice to MSEB by the Bombay High Court on November 9 over a civil suit filed by Indian financial institutions. 

MSEB further said that the DPC cannot be permitted to go ahead with the arbitration when the statute requires that its dispute with DPC be adjudicated upon only by the Merc. ""DPC is an Indian company doing business in India and subject to Indian laws and an utility within the meaning of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act (ERCA),"" MSEB added. MSEB has strongly denied DPC's apprehension that it would not get a proper or fair hearing before the MERC. It further said that ""MERC has both the competence3, expertise and regulatory responsibility to adjudicate upon the disputes raised in the MSEB's petition filed on May 25 before the MERC,"" it said. 

According to MSEB, the disputes it has raised before the MERC involve technical, commercial and legal issues and it would clearly have consequences/ramifications, which directly bear on matters which have exclusively been entrusted to the MERC under section 22 (1) and 29 of The ERCA. ""The MERC, which is fully competent in every respect to adjudicate upon, is an expert body with special knowledge and experience in matters relating to electricity in Maharashtra state,"" MSEB said. MSEB said that adjudicating functions/powers/jurisdiction have been conferred on the MERC in respect of disputes and differences between utilities.

THE DECCAN HERALD, Tuesday, November 20, 2001
DPC deadline expires for issuing final termination notice
The six-month deadline set by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to issue the final termination notice (FTN) expired today. The power major, however, has been restrained by the Bombay High Court from initiating the process till December 3. Had the DPC issued FTN today, it would have irrevocably bound all parties to ending the contract without going in for any alternative, an option which is still open. DPC, on April 19, slapped a preliminary termination notice (PTN) on MSEB, due to what it called continuing default in payment of dues by the board on several occasions and political interference to the detriment of its business operations. As per the power purchase agreement (PPA) signed between DPC and MSEB, the PTN gave six months to both parties to resolve the dispute, or else, allows the aggrieved party to terminate the contract and claim damages.While the possibility of DPC issuing the final termination notice was real, a dramatic intervention by the Indian financial institutions (FIs) led by IDBI, which moved the high court on November 5, have given a temporary reprieve to the MSEB. The FIs and banks pleaded for an injunction against DPC and sought reopening of the Dabhol plant The intervention by FIs so incensed DPC that it called off the two-day meeting with the representatives of the FIs in Singapore in protest .

However, it was persuaded to participate in the meeting, which was aimed at finding a buyer of Enron's stake in the company. Two private power majors, Tata Power and BSES, have shown interest in picking up Enron's stake, but at a discounted price The high court, which heard the preliminary arguments of the FIs and DPC on November 9, restrained DPC from issuing the FTN andadjourned the hearing till December 3. DPC sources told Deccan Herald the high court order means the PTN notice period will continue till December 3 and the company would initiate termination process on that day, if the high court allowed it to do so. DPC has claimed that the damages it would claim on final termination of the contract would run around Rs 24,000 crore. This figure too has been disputed by the MSEB and the state government. MSEB, on its part, stopped drawing power from Dabhol plant from May 29 onwards, which brought the plant to standstill

Greenfield-DPC time-charter pact set to be scrapped, P. Manoj 

THE time-charter party agreement signed between Greenfield Shipping Company and Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is set to be scrapped as an outcome of the controversy surrounding the Enron-promoted troubled power plant in Maharashtra. With Dabhol's LNG facility yet to go on stream, DPC will not be able to deploy the 1,37,000 cubic metre capacity tanker `LNG Laxmi' once the promoters of Greenfield deliver it to the charterer as per the charter party agreement signed between the two. The charter party agreement states that the charterer will have to take delivery of the tanker within 45 days of being delivered by the shipowners and operators. ``A failure by the charterer to take delivery of the tanker within the stipulated 45 days would automatically rescind the charter party agreement"", sources familiar with the developments told Business Line. 

Greenfield and DPC had entered into a time-charter agreement wherein DPC will time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for a period of 20 years at a charter hire rate of $ 98,600 per day for transporting gas from Oman to its LNG facility in Dabhol, Maharashtra. Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) is a 20 per cent stakeholder in Greenfield. The promoters of Greenfield took possession of the LNG carrier on November 15 after paying the last instalment of $ 55 million from Mitsubishi shipyard at Nagasaki in Japan, overcoming certain last-minute hiccups. Since DPC is not in a position to take physical delivery of the tanker, the promoters of Greenfield are going through the formalities to full-fill contractual obligations. After the 45 days time limit is exhausted and the time charter contract between Greenfield and DPC automatically annulled, the promoters of Greenfield will be able to time-charter `LNG Laxmi' to a new charterer. 

In the meanwhile, Greenfield was able to locate a new charterer in the form of Oman Government, which will time-charter `LNG Laxmi' for 20 years at a charter hire rate of a little over $ 70,000 per day as well as pick-up a 50 per cent stake in Greenfield. Enron-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc., one of the original promoters of Greenfield with a 20 per cent stake worth $ 11 million, has sold its entire stake to Oman Government. Besides, the lead-partner in the consortium, Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines have parted with half of its 60 per cent holding in Greenfield amounting to 30 per cent in favour of Oman Government. Oman Government will contribute $ 27.5 million for acquiring 50 per cent stake in Greenfield. It will sub-charter `LNG Laxmi' to Oman LNG in which it holds a 51 per cent stake. Oman LNG is expected to deploy `LNG Laxmi' to transport some of its LNG cargo sold on c.i.f basis to destinations including Britain and Korea, the sources said. A new time-charter party agreement between Greenfield and Oman Government will be inked after the DPC contract is revoked. Oman Government is currently thrashing out the finer details of the charter agreement with Oman LNG in which Shell,Total and Mitsubishi has equity stakes. `` This will ensure that LNG Laxmi is gainfully employed without being allowed to remain idle``, the sources said.

OUTLOOK (MAGAZINE), November 26th issue
Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage

Enron had no choice but agree to what seems to be a shotgun marriage with a rival, Dynegy, a fourth its size Lay: time to play dead? Enron, the most admired company in the US six years in a row, has been consigned to the dustbin of history and business school case studies. Once the darling of Wall Street for its aggressive no-holds-barred growth, its stock was languishing at historical lows of $7.21 last week, a steep fall of 90 per cent from its peak last October, representing a notional loss of $80 billion. In the last six weeks alone, its stock plunged by over 400 per cent.Kenneth Lay, the politically-connected chairman who counts on the United States' First as well as Second Families (Vice-President Dick Cheney) as close friends, and the acknowledged power behind 'deregulation', has faced a nightmare over the last three weeks.

Following a series of stories first published in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, Enron's stock went into a tailspin and it never recovered. The strawalbeit a heavy onethat broke the camel's back was a $1.01 billion charge on its pro-forma statement of earnings. Subsequently, it has emerged that most of Enron's purported earnings were bogus and accounting jugglery is the most charitable explanation. The company has formally acknowledged that its audited statements of earnings for the last three years were of no consequence! It appears that several limited partnerships (LJM and LJM2 in particular, apparently named after Star Wars film characters), in which officers of Enron had substantive financial interests, were key elements in its concocted business numbers. Enron had till now gotten way with the business equivalent of murder. To illustrate, in the matter of appointment of key regulatory figures in the US, the California power debacle in which the conservative California governor went as far as saying that nothing would please him more to see Kenneth Lay in a prison cell with a fellow cellmate greeting him with ""Hi Honey, my name is Spike,"" and its international operationsthe debacles in India, Indonesia, Nigeria etc, etc, the failures of its very expensive forays into the broadband and water businesseswere in a sense forgivable. What was unforgivable was the ultimate crime of siphoning off shareholders' money through these limited partnerships and brazenly lying to Wall Street.

With a daily decline in its share prices ($37 to $7 in two weeks), the failure of white knights to emerge (such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Holdings, on which Enron had pinned some hope), its bonds being only notionally above junk status (trading in two weeks from 101 to 65 cents on the dollar) and, consequently, the potential collapse of its trading business where it acts as a trusted counter party, Enron had no choice but to agree to what appears to be a shotgun marriage with a rival, Dynegy, a fourth of its size. The almost overnight surrender and the fact that the final price for Enron was as low as $8 billion represents a collapse unparalleled in recent business history.
 
This merger, slated to occur over the next six to nine months, subject to a series of caveats, may or may not take place as there could very well be several unpleasant surprises in store. Among these are the pending Securities and Exchange (SEC) investigation (in which the Enron counsel is a former colleague of the investigating officer!), the several dozen class-action suits filed over the last three weeks against Enron, its directors, Lay and several officers as well as its auditors Arthur Andersen, and, of course, appropriate regulatory approval.

In my opinion, the key surprise may very well be the several as-yet secret limited partnerships. If these are ever made public, the reverberations throughout the US business spectrum may be too unpleasant. In any event, the consequences of these events do not appear to have sunk in in India. Given the huge, and what appears to be a very difficult-to-service debt, of $22 billion from various forays that Enron has engaged in in the last three years (raised from $15 billion the week before), it is likely a solution crafted to the needs and limitations of all parties may be feasible given appropriate spine. Spine on India's part, that is.The terms that were proposed by Enron for a settlement of the Dabhol issuea payment of $1.2 billion, now brought down to $850 millionare clearly unacceptable. The missile that Enron has now aimed at India has not been comprehended either by the state apparatus or the media.
 
It rests in an order issued by the London High Court, which, inter alia, prohibits the government of Maharashtra from even opening its mouth about Enron, even in an Indian court or tribunal. There are several, in my opinion, historically unprecedented consequences of this. This craven, abject surrender of sovereignty is a result of a consent agreement the erstwhile BJP-Shiv Sena government signed a year after the fraudulent 'renegotiations'. This is a truly unpardonable crime and should be sufficient reason to send the 'renegotiators' to jail.

In any event, given a series of interests, inter alia the interests of Sharad Pawar (who negotiated the first Enron contract) and consequently the present state government, the danger that Indian financial institutions, in particular IDBI, may simply go under for lending without any due diligence to this over-invoiced project, the Damocles sword hanging over Maharashtra in the form of the London High Court order and so on, it may be in the best interests of all parties concerned to iron out an appropriate transparent agreement that has India's and the public interest at its core, a comprehensive settlement, given the effective non-existence of Enron at this moment in history

Aditya Birla group pitches for picking stake in Dabhol project, Sourav Majumdar & Namrata Singh 

 The Aditya Vikram Birla group is understood to have put in a statement of interest for the beleaguered 2,184-mw Dabhol power project. This has created a new twist to the Dabhol saga, which has been beset with uncertainties from the very beginning. The move comes close on the heels of the AV Birla group's decision last week to pick up Reliance Industries' over 10 per cent stake in construction and engineering major, Larsen & Toubro, for a consideration of Rs 766.50 crore. Industry sources conjecture that the Birlas might also be interested in jointly bidding for an 85-per cent stake in Dabhol Power Company (DPC) along with the Tatas. Tata group company Tata Power has already evinced a keen interest in bidding for the project, with the only other player in the fray being Mumbai's power utility major, BSES. 

Tata Power and BSES have already commissioned a due diligence study as a precursor to the bidding process. Birla group officials were unavailable for comment. Birla's interest in Dabhol has thrown up a fresh dimension to the DPC story even as it unfolds. The Birla group has a presence in the power sector with Rosa Power. The 567-mw Rosa Power project is a joint venture between the AV Birla group, which has a majority holding, and UK-based PowerGen. The possibility of a joint bid along with the Tatas, if it were to happen, would make this a second mega venture for the two major corporate groups in India. The two groups had last year struck a mega merger deal with the telecom venture, Birla-AT&T-Tata. However, it is not known as to which of the Birla group companies would be employed for the task of bidding for Dabhol. 

The 85 per cent stake in DPC under consideration includes the holdings of Enron Corporation, Bechtel Enterprises Inc. and General Electric, all US-based companies. MSEB, which is currently waging a legal battle with DPC over non-payment of dues, holds a 30-per cent stake in the 740-mw phase-I of the Dabhol project. The crux of the problem with the languishing project is unaffordable tariff rates, which the promoters are currently deliberating on as to how this could be reduced. The 1,444-mw phase-II of the project has been stalled midway. The bidding process for the stake under consideration would be critical with Enron, which was earlier demanding a price of $1.2 billion for exiting the project, agreeing to scale down the price demand by almost 30 per cent. Globally, parent Enron Corporation is being acquired by Houston-based Dynegy Inc. for $9 billion.

Venue for DPC arbitration process shifts to Singapore, Sanjay Jog 

The arbitration proceedings initiated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) against the Maharashtra government for non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore will now take place in Singapore instead of London. In view of the shifting of venue, a high-level team led by the state principal energy secretary VM Lal has flown to Singapore to hold talks with the arbitration tribunal for deciding future timetable to take up arbitration proceedings there. Official sources told The Financial Express that Mr Lal is accompanied by the state government solicitors Rafia Dada, Atual Harayani and Daraious Khambata. The state government team would hold talks with its arbitrator Quentin Loh, DPC's arbitrator Andrew John Rogers QC (formerly chief judge of the commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales) and the arbitration tribunal head Lord Mustill. The meeting deserves special significance especially when the DPC has agreed for due diligence by the Tata Power and BSES after signing a separate confidentiality agreement with it. 

This was agreed at a three-day meeting convened by the financial institutions at Singapore from November 8. Mr Lal's meeting with the arbitration tribunal is also crucial as the London Court through its ex-parte order of October 10 has restrained the state government from filing any suit in the Indian courts or tribunals against the DPC. Sources said that the government through its arbitrator would make a strong plea that the arbitration proceedings should await the outcome of the arbitration process between the DPC and the MSEB in order to save both time and duplication. ""This is in view of the fact that the parties are the same and the disputes emanate from the same set of facts and contractual obligations of the parties and the arbitrators named by both the parties for all the three arbitrations (DPC has served arbitration notices against the state government for latter's default in the implementation of state support agreement, supplemental state support agreement and state guarantee agreement) are the same,"" sources said. It must be noted here that the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has already restrained the DPC on May 29 from carrying out arbitration process against MSEB until the issue of MERC jurisdiction to adjudicate differences.

MSEB to skip DPC board meet 

THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has decided against attending the board meeting of Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to be held at London on November 30. The board will reportedly discuss issuing of the final termination notice (FTN). According to senior MSEB officials, the board is against the Enron-promoted DPC's proposal to grant the company's Managing Director rights to issue FTN according to his discretion. DPC has yet to approach its lenders for a go-ahead to issue the FTN, which will end the stint of the controversy-plagued 2,184-MW power company in the country. ""The decision to issue final termination in turn means wiping out the very existence of the company. We believe that such an important decision should not be left to one person. The entire board of directors should vote on it,'' a senior MSEB official told Business Line. Another reason for the board's decision to not attend the meeting 
is that MSEB does not have voting rights despite being a 15 per cent stakeholder.

The Enron scandal
Enron's root problem was in its investment activities, says A V Rajwade

Enron has always been recognised by other companies as best practice in risk management. It put in systems to manage risks on a real-time basis and had very strong management."" - James Lam, founder of eRisk, a consulting firm. As an occasional teacher and more regularly a student of the subject of management of price risks, I have been an admirer of Enron's elaborate disclosure of its risk management practices. And yet, in a cascade of events over a period of just three weeks from mid-October, it lost two-thirds of its share value, became the subject of a US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation, and was taken over by a rival a third in size. (Latest reports create some doubt about whether this will go through.) What went wrong? No, the events had nothing to do with Dabhol. Indeed, if, for us in India, Enron will always be associated with the controversial power project, elsewhere it is likely become a case study for students of accounting, finance and general management. (On second thoughts, even its Indian adventures would make an excellent case study!) 

But first, a recount of what happened. After announcing on October 16, without much explanation or transparency, that it has taken a charge of $ 1.2 billion against equity, Enron's share price started tumbling. Apparently, the charge was the result of some financial transactions, and the SEC launched an investigation. The chief financial officer (CFO), who was directly involved with the transactions, the company's treasurer and a couple of other senior officials were sacked. Perhaps most damagingly, Enron revised its accounts from 1997 onwards, reducing profits by about $ 600 million and increasing debt by a somewhat similar amount. As a result, Enron's credit rating was downgraded. It seems the root problem was not in its basic business of power and gas trading, but in its investment activities controlled by the CFO. These comprised private equity, and Enron's share in each of the investee companies was kept artificially below 50 per cent to avoid consolidation of accounts. To this end, outside investors were brought in and assured of equity in Enron itself, should the value of the investee company(ies) fall below agreed threshold(s). 

All this was done to keep the losses in investments off-balance sheet, and mitigate their impact on reported profits. Many other US corporations including J P Morgan Chase, which had large private equity investments, have suffered on this score (see World Money October 15). Enron wanted to avoid this and, last year, paid its since-dismissed CFO $ 30 million for his creative accounting genius. Incidentally, those enamoured of US GAAP and its alleged superiority over the rest of the world should note that all these gimmicks were blessed by the company's auditors - one of the Big Five firms, which was paid $ 25 million as audit fees and $ 27 million for other services by Enron last year. The restatement of the accounts from 1997 onwards became necessary as the Enron management/board and the auditors were forced, on review, to admit that at least some of the transactions should have been on, rather than off, balance sheet. Details of all the transactions in question are yet to come out, but what has come out is bad enough. 

But this apart, a billion dollar hit for a company of the size ($ 300 billion) or cash flow ($ 3 billion) of Enron is, by itself, hardly a death warrant. But it turned out to be just that for Enron. Perhaps because it was too arrogant? Perhaps also because its accounts lacked transparency and their opaqueness ensured that investors' confidence was always somewhat fragile? But there are two other points worth noting: the professionalism of equity analysts and whether the event restores somewhat the balance between trading and producing. As for the first, the professional analysts were surely aware of the opaqueness of the accounts, but few questioned the management aggressively on the subject. 

Perhaps the stock was too glamorous and typified the spirit of the times - trading assets was what the ""masters of the universe"" did, not the boring old business of producing oil or power or cars. The Enron management itself was proud of the way it operated in its principal activity of trading in power and gas, with Skilling, the former CEO, claming that ""we are on the side of angels. We are taking on the entrenched monopolies. We are bringing the benefits of choice and free markets to the world."" (The quotation is from an interview in BusinessWeek, prior to Skilling's inglorious exit from Enron a couple of weeks before the bubble burst). 

For the analysts, there was also safety in numbers. Skilling claimed that ""Enron's operations are built around the integration of modern financial technologies and physical technologies"", bringing derivatives theory to trading in power and gas! Obviously, the fate of Long Term Capital Management has not led to more sober management of trading risks. Surely the role of ""markets"" should be to reduce the distance, and cost, between producer and consumer? One does feel that there is something perverse in a society that values, in terms of compensation, the trader (don't forget this is just a euphemism for the speculator) over the producer - whether in the bond, currency or power and gas markets. The markets and, indeed, greed obviously have a role to play, but surely the pendulum needs to swing a little bit to the left?

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Saturday, November 24, 2001
Hurry while stocks last
BSES and Tata Power, the two companies which are interested in buying out Enron's stake in the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), should hurry up and make their offers soon. Failing that, a consortium of financial institutions should get together to bid for the equity as a strategic investment, to be sold off when prospects improve. There is a clearance sale at Houston and India must rush while stocks last. Enron is in deep financial trouble at home, where debts of close to $700 million have to be paid soon. The Houston-based energy giant is struggling to put together credit worth $1 billion, but less than half has come through. A merger with Dynegy, a smaller rival, could also be in trouble. All of this means that Enron will be happy to see cash upfront, even at a substantial discount to the $1.1 billion valuation for DPC. Reports say that Indian FIs think $700 to $800 million is a reasonable price, but the payments would be staggered over five years or so. Given Enron's current cash crunch, it would be better to haggle for an even lower price, but agree to pay all the money upfront. 

Acquiring DPC for a fraction of its original equity value will mean that debt will also have to be restructured drastically - all lenders have to take drastic haircuts - otherwise gearing will swell beyond all reasonable proportion. With equity and debt written down, Dabhol power will become cheaper. That will be good news, but India should wait before declaring this a milestone of power reforms. It isn't. The fundamental problems that make power projects high risk investments remain unresolved. Jurisdiction is scattered between central and state governments, power pricing is politically determined, theft is rampant and state electricity boards (SEBs) are bankrupt. 

Private power producers may soon be allowed to sell electricity to non-SEB bulk buyers, but that won't solve basic political and administrative problems. The real reforms have to take place in the states, where nothing is happening. A lot of hullabaloo was made about power reforms in Orissa. Yet AES tried to opt out because its distribution company faced enormous resistance while collecting dues from consumers. A recent World Bank study shows reform claims by states like Andhra are mostly hollow: rural power supply is patchy, of poor quality and has failed to justify people's expectations. This must change. Otherwise, even at substantially lower cost, projects like Dabhol will make no sense.

Dynegy has not informed Centre about Enron takeover: Minister
The union minister of state for power Jayavantiben Mehta on Friday said that the Dynegy Inc, which has recently launched the Enron acquisition process, has not yet formally informed the Centre about its decision. Ms Mehta after addressing a valedictory address at the three-day international conference on power sector organised by the India Tech Foundation told The Financial Express that though the Centre was aware of the Enron takeover by the Dynegy Inc, the Centre has not yet received any communication so far either from Enron or From Dynegy. Ms Mehta reiterated that the Centre was not at all interested to take over the distressed Dabhol project, neither the state-run National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) would made a bid for it. She admitted that the NTPC official attended the recently held Singapore meeting convened by the Indian Financial Institutions with the Dabhol Power Company, Tata Power and BSES to expedite the process of sale of Enron stakes in the Dabhol project. She made it clear again that NTPC would not take over the Dabhol project. Ms Mehta said that the Centre was committed for the capacity addition of one lakh megawatt by 2012 and added that the special secretary of the union ministry of power S Prabhakaran has recently submitted a report for achieving this target. Mr Prabhakaran's report has made various recommendations for the speedy development of various power projects for making available economical and quality power across the country by 2012. 

Dynegy denies going back on buyout 
The Dynegy Inc has scoffed at the reports of not going ahead with the acquisition of Enron in the wake of dip in the Enron share prices. ""We are encouraged by Enron Corp's report on Wednesday that it has closed the remaining $450 million credit facility secured by the assets of Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and has received a commitment from its lead bank to extend the $690 million note payable obligation described in Enron's recent 10-Q filing. We are continuing our confirmatory due deligence and working to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement,"" said the Dynergy Inc spokesperson John Sousa.

Enron bleeds again as Dynegy deal doubts grow 

A long weekend of work faced Dynegy and proposed acquisition Enron, whose worsening stock woes on Friday whipped up fear that the deal could be renegotiated or collapse entirely. Houston-based Dynegy and its advisers were expected to spend the long holiday weekend reviewing larger cross-town rival Enron's complex books, as both parties race against the decline in Enron's stock to complete the thorough financial examinations a merger requires. Enron shares ended down more than 5 per cent, or 27 cents, to $4.74 at the close of abbreviated Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares closed up 64 cents, or 1.61 per cent, to $40.40.

Dynegy on November 9 agreed to pay about $9 billion in stock for Enron. But, after falling 45 per cent by Friday's close amid fears it could run out of cash before the deal closes, Enron's market capitalization is only about $4.03 billion. At Dynegy's current stock price, its offer for Enron is worth about $10.85 a share -- more than twice Enron's current share price. Executives and advisers from both companies are in the final stages of the review, known as due diligence, sources familiar with the matter said. The sources said renegotiations had not been discussed as of Friday afternoon, and that such discussions could not occur until the due diligence review is finished. But should it turn up any more unpleasant surprises that qualify as a ""material adverse change"" in Enron's business, the likelihood increases of Dynegy invoking escape clauses or renegotiating, analysts and observers say. ""You've got to believe there is that possibility. There is a 90 per cent spread on the deal,"" said one analyst. ""There's unquestionably continued malaise in Enron's core business and Dynegy has left itself open to renegotiate with Enron."" UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone on Wednesday wrote in a research report that the likelihood was ""soaring"" that Dynegy might discover a material adverse change. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said that, to her knowledge, Dynegy was not renegotiating the terms of the acquisition. She repeated that Enron was working on obtaining an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity funding to help shore up the balance sheet. Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said due diligence was continuing and said the company remains optimistic about the merger.

TRADERS FEARING RENEGOTIATION

Enron's recent admission that lower volumes at its trading business -- the crown jewel of Enron that Dynegy most covets -- could cause low fourth-quarter earnings raises the possibility that the trading business is losing its profitability. Continued losses there would remove a key attraction for Dynegy. Electricity traders said the latest developments are making it seem more likely that Dynegy will renegotiate the deal or back out entirely, a move they said would leave Enron vulnerable to creditors and a possible bankruptcy. This week rating agency Fitch Investors said that if Dynegy stepped away from the merger, Enron's credit situation seemed untenable and a bankruptcy filing was highly possible. Traders, speaking on condition on anonymity, said they expected Dynegy to scramble over the weekend to narrow the growing share price gap. Enron's depleted market value and the shrinking volume in its EnronOnline trading system makes it more likely Dynegy could pull out, traders said.

Meanwhile, energy traders reiterated that they would shy away from long-term deals with Enron unless they received substantial assurances the company's credit rating would soon improve. Enron's bonds on Friday were again talked at junk-bond levels, but even lower than before. Enron's 6.4 per cent notes maturing in 2006 and its 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, according to a trader. The notes yield to maturity a respective 21.5 per cent and 17 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds fell about 1 cent on the dollar to just over 33 cents.

Enron is hovering at the edge of investment-grade as the three main credit trading agencies consider whether to cut them again, and some observers wonder how Enron has avoided it. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt and does not own Enron.

Enron avoids junk status, NEW YORK

It is rare that holding onto investment-grade credit ratings means as much to a company as it does now to beleaguered energy trader Enron, and some observers are wondering why a cut to junk status is taking so long. ""The sum of all knowledge is in the valuation of the stock and the bonds,"" said Scott Smith, a principal at Wells Capital Management in San Francisco, where he invests $6 billion in debt, and does not own Enron. ""A bond trading in the 50s has nothing to do with an investment-grade security."" Enron's 6.4 per cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes were bid Friday at 57 cents on the dollar, down from a respective 62 and 60 cents on Wednesday, a trader said. The notes yield to maturity 21.5 per cent and 17 per cent.

Meanwhile, Enron's shares have sunk 94 per cent this year. Since October 16, when it released third-quarter results, which it has since revised downward, its shares have fallen 86 per cent, and its bonds by nearly half. Houston-based Enron, which is trying to merge with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy, has been rocked this year by accounting problems, earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a top management shuffle. Its advisers were expected this weekend to pore over the company's books, which could lead to a renegotiation of the merger, sources familiar with the matter said. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have cut its senior unsecured debt ratings twice in the last month to their current Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" their lowest investment grades. Fitch has cut its equivalent rating to ""BBB-minus,"" and all three agencies have warned of more possible cuts.

The stakes could hardly be higher. 

A downgrade to ""junk"" status could imperil Enron's trading business, force it to pay off as much as $3.9 billion of debt issued mostly by two trusts, and possibly force it to seek bankruptcy protection, analysts said. Enron said in a securities filing it recently had less than $2 billion of available cash and credit lines. S&P said on Tuesday that Enron faces ""liquidity issues,"" but enjoys an ""alignment of interests"" with its banks and a near-term financial position that ""is expected to be sufficient"" to allow the Dynegy merger. Fitch, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that ""our present 'BBB-minus' rating rests on the merger possibility and continued support of the lending banks."" If Dynegy walks away, it said, ""Enron's credit situation seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible.""

Enron said on Monday it had $9.15 billion of obligations due through next year, and a $690 million note that could come due next Tuesday. It later said it got a three-week reprieve. Sean Egan, managing director of Egan-Jones Ratings in Philadelphia, likened Enron's ratings situation to those of California's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison . Despite investor unease, those utilities kept their investment-grade ratings only until they defaulted on debt in January, as California's power crisis worsened. On November 8, a day before the Dynegy merger was announced, senior officials from Enron's lead banks -- William Harrison, chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase, and Michael Carpenter, who runs Citigroup's investment banking arm -- met with Moody's to help allay that agency's concerns, a person familiar with the meeting said. 

A day later, Moody's, which issued no statement on Enron this week, downgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating, but only to its current ""Baa3."" ""Pressure is coming from the investment banks, which have a vested interest in seeing the Dynegy deal go through,"" said Egan, whose agency rates Enron's debt ""BB,"" its second-highest junk grade. ""Investment banking fees will be substantial."" Companies pay for Moody's and S&P ratings, which they need to obtain financing. Egan said his agency receives no such payments. Citigroup and JP Morgan declined to comment. Moody's and S&P did not immediately return phone calls. Fitch was not immediately available for comment. Dynegy and Enron on Wednesday, however, reaffirmed their commitment to the merger. Wells Capital's Smith isn't sure what to expect. ""Enron will remain definitively investment grade if the merger as billed goes through, but there are half a dozen things that could go wrong,"" he said. ""Obviously, the equity markets are telling you it's very skeptical the merger will go through, and the bond market is following its lead.""( REUTERS )

Devil in the details, Devangshu datta 

Looking at the market now, it's almost as though September 11 never happened. The indices are back above September 12 trading levels,local investors are trading enthusiastically, volume and price recovery is evident across the board. Maybe this is because Kabul has fallen and Kandahar is within a week of collapse. But the USSR had control of every Afghan population centre within 24 hours of the 1979 airlift invasion. It already had a puppet regime in place. The Red Army withdrew after eight more years of bitter fighting and 35,000 casualties! It would thus take a historical ignoramus to assume that this war will end with the capture of Kandahar. Other signals are even more disquieting. Every FII appears to be in the process of either pulling out totally or cutting back on its Indian presence. There could be several reasons. The US slowdown has been cited, so has Enron. Whatever the reasons, it is an amazing turnaround of sentiment, given that 2001 began with the FIIs pumping in money. There could be pressure on Indian reserves in the next fiscal and that could have prompted the currency downgrade. The market revival is a little puzzling when one examines details. ICE stocks that have delivered poor Q2 results have moved up sharply whereas ICE stocks that have delivered decent results have not. There are strong rumours that operators are trying to ramp up prices, lure in smalltimers and offload the K-10 stocks they've held since March. 

Old economy movements could more credibly be ascribed to value-buying. But even here, a lot of action is based on rumour mongering. Some MNC is about to make an open offer, somebody else is going to divest a loss making division. That sort of thing seems a little pronounced at the moment. Undoubtedly there are value-based buys available. But value based buying requires the strictest adherence to discipline and it's interesting to apply standard parameters to the market as a whole. The Nifty is trading at a price-earnings ratio of 14 plus, it has a price book value ratio of 2.25 and a dividend yield of 1.6 per cent at current rates. This is an economy where returns of approximately 6.7 per cent are safely available from short-term debt and inflation is around 5.5 per cent to 6 per cent. Long term debt returns range up to about 11 per cent for the savvy trader and around 9.5 per cent for the passive investor. 

A value investor would thus look to see if his projections suggested the following: First that EPS growth will beat at least 15 per cent, second that the P-BV is historically low and returns from capital gains plus dividend yield would beat 15 per cent over the next year. Assuming constant inflation, and adjusting for dividend, the Nifty would have to improve by 12 per cent to 15 per cent to meet the capital gains target. Overall EPS growth beating 15 per cent looks doubtful. P-BV is on the low side. A further index improvement of 15 per cent also looks a stretch. Broad-based buying thus seems a 50-50 shot unless the investor waits much longer.

Enron staff sue as pension savings evaporate 

AFTER climbing utility poles in all kinds of weather for 35 years, Roy Rinard was hoping to retire in a few years, but that was before the collapse in Enron's stock price devoured his retirement savings. ""I'm basically wiped out,"" said Rinard, 54, who works for Portland General Electric, an Oregon utility company acquired by the Houston-based energy trading giant in 1997. ""I'm right back to ground zero and I'll have to go on working as long as I can,"" said Rinard, who suffers from arthritis and a lung condition that leaves him short of breath. Encouraged by Enron's then-strong performance and the company's bullish view of its future prospects, Rinard moved all of the money invested in his 401(k) retirement account into Enron stock earlier this year.But it proved to be a costly decision as the value of his account fell from $470,000 a year ago to around $40,000 today. Rinard now hopes a lawsuit filed in US District Court in Houston will recover at least some of his money. The suit, filed on behalf of Enron employees by Seattle-based law firm Hagens Berman, alleges that Enron breached its fiduciary duty by encouraging its employees to invest heavily in Enron stock without warning them of the risks of doing so.

Enron's stock, which peaked at $90 in August 2000, closed at $4.74 on Friday, after falling sharply in recent weeks amid a series of damaging financial disclosures. A broadly similar suit filed by the Keller Rohrback law firm, also Seattle based, alleges that another Enron employee, Pamela Tittle, lost $140,000 on Enron stock held in her retirement account. According to that suit, the Enron retirement savings plan had assets worth $2.1 billion at the end of last year, including $1.3 billion, or 62 per cent of the total, in Enron stock.

DOUBTS EMERGE ABOUT DYNEGY DEAL

Enron, a former Wall Street favorite, agreed to be bought out earlier this month by smaller energy trading rival Dynegy Inc., but continuing problems at Enron have caused some analysts to question whether the deal will be completed. Doubts have also been expressed about a planned sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural Gas. Hagens Berman plans to seek class-action status for its suit and says 21,000 Enron employees could be eligible to join it. The suit alleges that Enron ""locked down"" 401(k) retirement accounts on October 17, preventing employees from changing the investments they held in their accounts until November 19.

During that period Enron reported its first quarterly loss in four years and took a charge of $1.2 billion against stockholders' equity as a result of off-balance-sheet deals that would later come under investigation by US regulators. In that time, Enron shares fell from $30.72 at the close of trading October 16 to $11.69 on November 19. Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne said employees' access to the accounts was blocked as part of a previously planned change in the administration of the retirement plan and that the measure was in effect from October 26. to November 19.Steve Lacey, a 45-year-old emergency repair dispatcher who has worked for Portland General Electric for 21 years, said the measure came at a time when bad news about Enron was flying thick and fast, driving the stock price down at a dizzying pace. ""We couldn't take our money out of Enron stock into another portfolio. Basically they had us locked down to where we had no say over our own future,"" he said.

Lacey declined to quantify his own losses but said he and many of his colleagues had invested most of their retirement funds in Enron stock because it had performed better in the past than the other investments available under the Enron plan. Denne said Enron employees were normally able to choose among 18 different investment options, but Enron's matching contributions were always made in the form of its own stock. Lacey said he felt sorry for older colleagues at Portland General who had suffered a heavy financial blow just before they were due to retire, adding that he was only beginning to realize how serious the consequences could be for himself. ""My goal was to have an extremely comfortable retirement and that may be a little clouded now,"" he said.( REUTERS )

Pune-based NGO wants limited role for Merc in setting MSEB tariff, Sanjay Jog 

The Pune-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Prayas alongwith Mumbai Grahak Panchayat, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and Akhil Bharatiya Grahak Panchayat have jointly appealed to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc) that the Maharashtra government should not be accorded special privileges and its role in the determination of tariff of Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) should be limited. These organisations have pointed out that unless the state government was prepared to compensate MSEB in the manner determined by Merc, it has no authority to interfere in the tariff determination process. ""Though under section 39 of the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act (ERCA), the state government has the authority to issue policy directives to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (Serc), section 29 clearly specifies that the Serc has to determine the tariff and also specifies certain guidelines for the same,"" organisation said. These organisations have observed that guidelines for determining tariff do not include any ""policy directive"" from the state government. Commenting on the state government's affidavit suggesting reduction in the 19 per cent tariff hike proposed by MSEB for 2001-02, they have called upon Merc not to accept any variation in tariff proposed by the state government as ""policy directive."" 

These organisations have expressed surprise over the state government's submission that there was a difference between the government and MSEB. They have also questioned the state government's request that the Merc should take an appropriate steps in order to ensure agreement between state government and MSEB. These organisations, also, have made it clear that the tariff determination was under the exclusive domain of Merc and it has to give an order based only on the evidence that comes before it through various affidavits and submissions. ""The ERCA does not allow any other role or mechanism for Merc or any other party in the context of tariff revision. As such, we request Merc from taking any steps to help MSEB and the state government reach an agreement. This aspect be left to the state government and MSEB,"" they added. Sources said that the state government is likely to make a fresh affidavit on giving policy directives to the Merc as well as providing compensation to the MSEB by November 28.

Maharashtra may have to pay Rs 60000 crore to MSEB: Godbole 

Maharashtra may have to pay a whopping Rs 60,000 crore to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) if it fails to resolve the Enron imbroglio amicably, Madhav Godbole, chairman of the energy review committee, has said. Godbole blamed the inefficiencies of state-run undertakings for the Enron crisis and said the only way to avoid a recurrence was to privatise MSEB. Politicians and the employees' union would oppose privatisation of MSEB, but its dismal performance and growing transmission and distribution losses have left little option but to go for privatisation in a phased manner, Godbole said. He urged the people to mount pressure on the state government on the issue and stressed it was necessary to avoid such disasters. 

Delivering the second E F Schumacher memorial lecture here, instituted by Nagpur University in association with Dr Padmakar Sapre, Godbole painted a very gloomy picture of Maharashtra's economy, noting that the state was on the verge of bankruptcy owing to ""suicidal policies followed by successive governments."" Speaking on 'financial management of Maharashtra: problems and perspectives,' Godbole stressed the need to introduce stringent policies to get over the messy financial situation. He advocated re-introduction of zero-based budgeting and fixing priority, so as to curb unnecessary expenditure. Godbole said, despite ten years of economic liberalisation, very little has changed. Fiscal deficit in 1990-91 was 9.49 per cent, and it remains where it was. Revenue deficit had gone up from 4.2 per cent to 6.2 per cent in 2000-2001. 

The public sector savings have touched an all-time low of 1.2 per cent and consumption expenditure was on the rise. Godbole pointed out that 58 per cent of the state budget was spent on wages and 23 per cent on payment of interest leaving very little for capital investment. He claimed that Maharashtra was doling out Rs 18,000 crore as subsidies under various heads and has become the highest subsidy-providing state in the country. When Central assistance was dwindling due to the new formula of allocation from a Central pool, states such as Maharashtra would receive a lesser share in coming years, he said. 

He came down heavily on the misuse of state funds by co-operative societies and charged that a promoter had to invest only 2 per cent amount while the rest was made good by the state government. Heavy spending on higher education must be stopped forthwith, he said, adding that the society must learn to take care of such sectors by itself without burdening the state. The money thus saved should instead be diverted towards primary education, he said. Godbole pointed out that the annual budget was irrelevant because of increasing off-budget transactions, which were out of public scrutiny. He said, due to overall mismanagement, the state government was forced to resort to go for overdrafts for a period of 37 days in 2000-2001. 

Godbole said populist schemes such as the monopoly cotton procurement scheme (MCPS) had no place in a globalised economy and its rising losses were a matter of great worry. He criticised the state government for delinking cotton price from the prevailing market price and stated that the basic purpose behind MCPS had been lost in the race for reaping electoral gains. Godbole strongly advocate enactment of a 'Budgetary and Financial State Management Act' to check unnecessary expenditure and fiscal discipline. He criticised the state government for extending loan counter-guarantees to various undertakings under its control. 

Till date, the state government had extended counter-guarantees for loans worth Rs 2.34 lakh crore, he said. ""This was done when the total annual receipts of the state were merely Rs 35,000 crore,"" he said. Godbole advocated downsizing of the government and a ban on fresh recruitment. An attractive voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) should be offered to employees and contract-system be introduced, he said. He also supported the concept of contributory pension for employees and pointed out that under the present scheme, the state government was burdened with paying a sum of Rs. 2600 crore to five lakh pensioners. A state expenditure commission must be set up immediately for reviewing of expenses incurred by the state on permanent basis, Godbole suggested. Nagpur University vice-chancellor Arun Satputaley presided over the function.

THE ASIAN AGE, Saturday, November 24, 2001
BJP loan costs state Rs 6,000 cr, Olga Tellis 
Maharashtra is still reeling financially from the three major actions of its predecessor government. One, it ran up debts of Rs 40,000 crores in five years; two, it formally permitted the second phase of the Dabhol power project after declaring that it would throw Dabhol Phase 1 into the Arabian Sea; and three, it hurriedly announced the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission award. Maharashtra is paying Rs 6,000 crores in annual interest on bonds and loans that the predecessor Sena-BJP government accumulated during its five-year rule. Senior Congressman and Cabinet minister for labour Satish Chaturvedi said the Congress ruled the state for 35 of the 41 years that the state has been in existence. During these 35 years, the total debt built up by Congress governments was about Rs 15,000 crores. As against this, the Sena-BJP in five years borrowed merrily and issued bonds for approximately Rs 45,000 crores. So its successor Democratic Front government, led by the Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar Congress respectively, is paying a crippling Rs 6,000 crores interest annually within specified time limits. Speaking to The Asian Age, Mr Chaturvedi said that at stake is more than Maharashtra's prestige as the favoured industrial destination of the country for the rest of the world because, if the state falls back on its interest payments, it will also restrict its capacity to borrow. 

Maharashtra's annual budget is Rs 16,000 crores. Out of this, Rs 6,000 crores goes straight away as interest payment. The second burden left behind by the Sena-BJP is the permission given to Enron to go ahead with phase two of the Dabhol power project, besides increasing the total capacity of the plant. This phase two will impose an annual encumbrance of Rs 6,000 crores, whether or not the state uses the power. The state, as the senior minister says, ""absolutely cannot survive this financial burden that will be imposed when phase two of Dabhol comes on stream."" The state does not want the project but the financial institutions led by IDBI, who are caught in a trap, would want the project to be completed so they don't have any liabilities that will arise with the lenders if the project is scrapped. IDBI has stood guarantee for Rs 5,500 crores. Additionally, if the state loses the arbitration proceedings currently on in London, the claims on it will be around Rs 500 crores. 

The third and equally devastating financial burden is the acceptance of the Fifth Pay Commission award which the Sena-BJP government announced shortly before its term ended. Paying just 50 per cent of the DA has cost the government around Rs 250 crores to Rs 300 crores. The government has not paid the workers' bonus as it would have cost Rs 750 crores and this does not include the pensions, which would run into several hundred crores. Maharashtra is among the three states that have accepted the Fifth Pay Commission, the others being Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. The state also has a problem meeting commitments given to cotton growers who dominate the Vidarbha region. The loss to the government in the monopoly purchase of cotton is said to be around Rs 800 crores. 

The Centre has announced a support price of Rs 1,800 per quintal while the state is committed to purchase cotton at Rs 2,300 per quintal. The price of cotton in the market is Rs 1,400 for imported cotton. There are about 22-lakh to 23-lakh bales of cotton lying in the market yard. If the government disposes of this cotton at the market price, it will lose Rs 350 crores. So the government has to arrange for Rs 3,500 crores for the cotton monopoly scheme. The state is also in a Catch-22 situation as far as the state-run textile mills are concerned. The government is currently spending Rs 20 lakhs per day running nine textile mills. Two mills out of these have now been shut and the workers given VRS, which cost the government around Rs 20 crores to Rs 30 crores. If they are to close down the seven others, they will have to arrange finance of Rs 250 crores. So their dilemma is whether to continue to pay Rs 20 lakhs a day or get this lumpsum of Rs 250 crores and close the mills at one go.

"FW: High Inventories and Weak Jet Demand Shape the Heating Oil Market - CERA Alert","Note:  Stocks of heating oil are very high for this winter, affecting the

Market - CERA Alert 



Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

"Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive","Howdy Ags!!

The two-year remembrance of the Aggie Bonfire collapse is upon us.  We still unfortunately have no Bonfire, but there is something we, as Aggies, can get together and do to remember our Bonfire 12.

Off Campus Aggies and The Association of Former Students are sponsoring the second annual Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive. Now, through this weekend, with the help of The Reveille Club of Houston and many A&M clubs throughout the state and nation, we will remember and honor our 12 fallen Aggies.  

As you know, many around the state and country rallied around us at our darkest hour, and this is one little way, even when Bonfire returns, to show our appreciation for the support they gave us at our greatest time of need.  It's also a tremendous way to show we will not forget what happened on November 18, 1999.  Several of the families have expressed their support for this endeavor, and I think we need to do all we can to show them how much a part of the Aggie family they are, and how strong the Aggie Spirit is, was, and always will be.  

The need for blood is a constant battle for blood banks around the country.  The holidays are especially critical as donation levels typically fall while the need for donations actually rises.  In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, record numbers of Americans turned out to give blood.  What many may not know is that the blood collections are only good for a limited amount of time.  This week begins the period when many units of blood collected will need to be replaced. 

Last year, with very little notice, Aggies rallied to support our cause. We raised more 5,300 units of blood in 200.  Our goal for this year is to see 12,000 units of blood donated, and details on all the drives can be found at http://bleedmaroon.tamu.edu.   Also, most donation sites have a limited supply of Everyone Bleeds Maroon Bonfire Memorial Blood Drive T-shirts that you will receive in thanks for donating.  

Drives will be held on Saturday, November 17 in Angelino County (Lufkin), Dallas, Ft. Worth, Denver (CO), Ft. Hood/Killeen, Houston and surrounding areas, Karnes City, Kingwood, Longview, Marshall, McAllen, and New Braunfels.  Drives are going on throughout the week in Austin, Beaumont, TAMU-Galveston, Phoenix (AZ), and into next week in San Antonio and Nacogdoches County.  Phoenix has challenged alumni in their area from all Big 12 schools to donate as a sort of friendly competition.

Here on the Texas A&M University campus, you can donate at the Commons, Rudder, the Rec Center, Bush Academic Building, Duncan, Zachary, Vet School, Bio-Bio, Sbisa, and Wehner.  

Even if you can't make it out on the specific day to the specific place you can still get in touch with the blood bank in your area and ask to donate in the name of Everyone Bleeds Maroon. 

If you gave in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks you can still safely be a part of this event. Please pass this on and help spread the word.  We hope everyone will take the time to get out and give this week, and do their part in remembering the fallen of Nov. 18, 1999 as well as those no longer with us as of Sept. 11, 2001.

This is for Miranda, Jerry, Bryan, Tim, Jamie, Michael, Jeremy, Christopher B., Chris H., Lucas, Chad, Nathan, and all of the injured.  We'll never forget.  

Thanks, Gig 'Em, and God Bless America.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

A.V. Birla 'not keen' on Dabhol 

THE A.V. Birla group today said it is not interested in buying a stake in the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Co (DPC), although it appears to have studied the power project. In a statement, the group said it has ``looked'' at the Dabhol project but is ``not interested in pursuing an equity investment in DPC.'' Currently, financial institutions are considering proposals put forth by Tata Power Co and BSES Ltd to pick up Enron's 65 per cent stake in DPC. However, Ms Jayawantiben Mehta, Union Minister of State for Power, has said that any third party stepping in to bid for Enron would be welcomed by the Government as that would increase competition, thereby reducing price. Ms Mehta was responding to queries by mediapersons on the reported entry of a third bidder for DPC on the sidelines of a banking and finance seminar here. ``Our only mission is to increase generation of power and make it available at cheaper prices. Buying power from Enron is an option only if the power tariff is reasonable,'' Ms Mehta said. 

Regarding the sale of Enron's stake in DPC, she said there was a specific time-frame assigned for completing the due diligence process. ``Once the process is complete it will not take time to finalise a deal,'' she said. Talking about the disbursements for the Accelerated Power Development Project (APDP), Ms Mehta admitted to delays in disbursements earlier but the Government has learnt from these mistakes and will try to make the process quicker, she said. She added, ``The Government has decided to allocate Rs 113.95 crore to Bombay Electricity Supply and Transport Company (BEST) for the year 2001-2002 for transmission, distribution and convergence purposes. The disbursements will be made shortly. A special account will be opened for these funds with the State Government. This money is to be used within a period of one year but BEST will be given additional funds as and when they need it.'' The total allocation for Maharashtra under APDP is more than Rs 300 crore.

DPC board meet on course despite MSEB dissent note, Sanjay Jog

Dabhol Power Company (DPC), notwithstanding the dissent note filed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), is firm on holding its board meeting on November 30 in London to authorise Enron India managing director K Wade Cline to issue a final termination notice to the MSEB. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal and state principal secretary VM Lal, who are directors on the DPC board, have decided not to attend the meeting. DPC spokesperson Jimmy Mogal confirmed that the DPC board meeting would take place as per schedule. ""The November 30 meeting will take place as it is a statutory company law requirement,"" he told The Financial Express. Mr Mogal, however, declined to comment on the receipt of a dissent note from the MSEB blaming DPC for its mismanagement which led to a situation for the issuance of a final termination notice. According to MSEB sources, it has questioned the holding of November 30 meeting especially when it had cancelled the previous board meeting scheduled for November 19 in London at the last minute. MSEB has also demanded a change in the venue of the meeting from London to Mumbai. The state electricity board has also taken an objection for the ensuing meeting especially when the Bombay high court has already restrained DPC from issuing a final termination notice to it in its November 9 ad interim order granted on a civil suit filed by financial institutions.

MSEB has reiterated its claim that it was DPC's successive material misrepresentation and default on the availability of power which led to the present situation. Had DPC corrected its capacity availability after the MSEB imposed rebate for the first time in February, the situation would not have reached this stage, sources added. MSEB also blamed DPC for non-payment of rebate of Rs 401 crore imposed by it for the default on the availability of power on January 28. Furthermore, it also defaulted on February 13 and March 29 and failed to pay successive rebates revised thereafter. The November 30 meeting would also take up issues related to asset preservation, financial position of phase-I, debt servicing of phase-II and opening of letter of credit for the charter. Meanwhile, MSEB technical director (corporate planning) Prem Paunikar, who is also on the DPC board, has resigned for personal reasons. He will be relieved on November 29. Mr Paunikar will be replaced by Mr Gurcharan Singh, who is currently in charge of hydrogrid.

November 30: The countdown begins for Dabhol, S Ravindran Mumbai 

Global lenders to the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) are meeting in London on November 30 to consider authorising the firm to serve a final termination notice on the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). On the same day, the DPC board will meet in London to consider authorising managing director K Wade Cline to serve the final termination notice on MSEB. Even if Cline gets the nod from the board, he will not be in a position to serve the notice unless the lenders give the go-ahead. ""We have decided to meet on November 30 as it is convenient for us. The DPC board meeting is a pure coincidence,"" sources in the lenders' consortium said. The meeting assumes significance as it is being held in the backdrop of a Mumbai High Court injunction restraining DPC from serving the final termination notice. The lenders are planning to consult their lawyers, White Case, on the feasibility of such a move. The steering committee of the lenders comprising Credit Suisse First Boston, Citibank, Bank of America, OPIC, ANZ Investment Bank and the Industrial Bank of India will meet to take stock of the situation.

MSEB denies sops to DPC buyer 

THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board has turned down IDBI-led FIs' plea to slice out one of its distribution circles to gift to the buyer of Enron's Dabhol Power Company as part of a payment security mechanism. This has the potential to derail the ongoing discussions with the two prospective bidders as Tata Power and BSES are unlikely to proceed with the deal without such a viable model in place. ""So far, all the discussions between the FIs and the utilities were based on the assumption that MSEB and the state government would agree to this lollipop,"" said a senior FI official. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal confirmed he had received a proposal from FIs. ""The model is not agreeable to us. We simply can't afford to part ways with any of our distribution circles. That will jeopardise MSEB's cashflows.""

Life after Enron

OBITUARIES for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) were premature. With every passing week, it appears that the 2,100 MW power project in Maharashtra is likely to be reincarnated in a new, improved avatar. The domestic troubles of Enron, the Houston-based energy giant that owns 65 per cent of DPC equity, have actually made DPC more attractive to local buyers. The Aditya Vikram Birla group now joins BSES and Tata Power as suitors for the stake of Enron, and maybe the additional 20 per cent equally owned by GE and Bechtel, which are also keen to exit. Enron initially valued DPC equity at $1.1 billion. However, it has become clear that it will have to take a discount on this: the final figure could come down to $700 million or even less. The prospect of buying out a state-of-the-art power plant at a very attractive price has attracted companies like BSES, Tata Power and now, the AV Birla group. 

What Enron needs now is cash: finances of the Houston giant are shaky and it has to arrange credit for nearly $700 million debt quickly. Given that, Indian buyers can winkle out an even bigger discount by agreeing to pay the money up front, instead of in instalments. Inevitably, lenders will also have to write down interest on debt, or even take some writeoffs to bring debt in line with lower equity valuation. Once the financial restructuring is complete, DPC power will become affordable. Or will it? Arguably, electricity has been India's most reform-proof sector. This resistance to change has deep roots: in administrative collapse, populist politics, the dominance of the public sector at the Centre and states; in corruption, regulatory failure or apathy and with consumers who are used to getting power free. To make DPC - or any power project - viable in the long run, consumers have to start paying for electricity. Failing that, utilities should cut them off. This will need a great deal of support from state administrations. SEBs have to be privatised. If the new Electricity Bill is made into law, states will have the freedom to privatise distribution without amending local laws, IPPs will be able to sell power to consumers. This is a large reform programme which will need serious political will at all levels of government to implement. Yet, experience has shown that nothing less will work.

ONGC board meet holds key to Panna Mukta operatorship, Prasanna Upadhyay

The thorny issue of the operatorship rights for the Panna Mukta Tapti oil and gas fields is coming to a head as the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) board is slated to meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue threadbare. The hopes of British Gas (BG), which has decided to buy out the 30 per cent Enron stake in the oil fields, rests largely on the board meeting, as BG has made it clear that it will go through the deal only if it gets sole operatorship. However, ONGC, which holds 40 per cent in the fields, and Reliance, the other 30 per cent stakeholder, have both pitched for operatorship rights. Only if the ONGC board agrees to allow BG to take the rights can the deal be carried forward from BG's end. ONGC chairman Subir Raha could not be reached for comments by The Financial Express despite several attempts.

According to sources close to BG, the company is confident that ONGC would agree to transfer of operatorship from Enron to BG. These sources said that BG would pick up Enron's stake in the oil fields, subject to transfer of operatorship and till the issue was resolved the question of paying up the $388 million for the deal did not arise. While there is talk that Enron may be wanting BG to hurry up with the payment for the deal in view of Enron's global problems, there was no independent confirmation of this from either BG or from Enron. An official spokesperson of Enron in India declined to comment on the issue. ""The company has clarified that the deal is subject to operatorship otherwise it is off from our side,"" the sources close to BG said. While sources close to BG added that Reliance has agreed for transfer of operatorship from Enron to BG, a Reliance spokesperson, when contacted, categorically denied that Reliance had given a green signal for transfer of the operatorship to BG. 

While BG is confident that ONGC would agree for transfer of operatorship to it, ONGC's unions have said that the oil major has enormous experience in the field and had also discovered the fields. According to sources, to resolve the issue, the suggestion of joint venture operatorship was raised from some quarters, so that all the three joint venture partners could be included in the operatorship. Another suggestion was that the three fields should be distributed to the three partners. However, BG is sticking to its demand for sole operatorship. The fields produce around 300 cubic metres of gas and 29,000 barrels of oil per day. Enron, which has been taken over by Dynegy Inc has decided to withdraw from oil and gas in India as part of its global strategy.

Man arrested for issuing e-mail threat to Enron ( carried only by the online edition)

PUNE- If you're thinking of sending scary, anonymous emails, think again.The police are fast catching up on the technology to trace such mails. On Friday, the Ratnagiri police arrested Pune-based computer professional Habibuddin Sheikh 20). A former employee of the Dabhol Power Corporation DPC) Sheikh had sent an email threatening to blow up DPC's Guhagar plant. According to the Ratnagiri police, DPC received the threatening mail last month.The company was being targeted because it was a venture of the American giant Enron, the mail said. Superintendent of police Vinaykumar Chaube immediately formed a special team and tracked the mail down to a cybercafe in Wanowrie in Pune. The cybercafe records revealed that Sheikh had used the cyber cafe at the time and day on which the mail was received by DPC.The investigators were already working on the hunch that the mail must have been the handiwork of one of the 1,000 workers retrenched by the company. Sheikh's handwriting in the company's records too matched.

HC to hear Dabhol Corp plea from Dec 11

Mumbai high court today decided to hear from December 11 a petition filed by Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC), challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adjudicate US-based multinational's dispute with state electricity board (MSEB) A bench headed by justice Ajit Shah decided to hear the matter for a week at a stretch and allowed MERC members Mr P Subrahmanyam and Mr Venkat Chary to be impleaded as respondents. They have been asked to file affidavits by November nine.Another MERC member Mr Jayant Deo urged the court that he would like to recluse himself from the proceedings as DPC had levelled allegations of bias against him.The court also allowed the chamber summons moved by DPC urging for permission to amend the main petition in view of allegations of bias against Mr Deo. The judges have asked the petitioner to carry out amendments within a week. The court had earlier asked Mr Deo to file by September 27 his response to allegations of bias made by DPC. He filed an affidavit denying bias against DPC and justified his neutral stand as a MERC member.As regards two intervening applications filed by US Exim Bank and a consortium of 11 offshore lenders of DPC, the judges had held that they would not be allowed to make any pleadings. However, they were permitted to assist the court by making oral submissions. DPC had filed chamber summons alleging that Mr Deo had on earlier occasions espoused views which were critical of the 2,184 MW power project and PPA

Maharashtra cautioned on Dabhol stand-off

THE financial standing of the Maharashtra Government would be certainly impaired if the power purchase agreement (PPA) between Dabhol Power Company and the State Electricity Board is not successfully renegotiated, according to rating agency CARE. Commenting on the State finances while rating a Rs 600-crore bond issue of the Maharashtra Krishna Valley Development Corporation (MKVDC), CARE said fiscal reforms assume greater urgency because the credit quality of the State would be impacted if there is a devolution of liabilities guaranteed by it in the PPA. Ballpark estimates place the size of the States' immediate liabilities at Rs 17,000 crore. If the worst case scenario is realised, the Government's liquidity position and financial flexibility will be acutely impaired. 

However, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), to which the assets would stand transferred if the State decides to take over the project, will have the option of inviting third parties to participate in the venture minimising the State's liabilities. A CARE official said even if a third party is involved in the project, the State would have to take a sizeable hit on capital employed. He put the loss burden on Maharashtra at around Rs 8,000-9,000 crore. CARE said the guarantees given by the Government to its special purpose vehicles' borrowings have risen substantially. The total outstanding liabilities of Maharashtra as a proportion of the net State domestic product have increased to 29.1 per cent (estimated) in 2000-01 from 19 per cent in 1996- 97.The State's financial position calls for fiscal consolidation through improvement in revenue performance and restructuring of expenditure, it said. Meanwhile, the agency has assigned a rating of A+(SO) to the MKVDC issue. The long-term taxable bonds have a bullet payment at the end of 10 years. MKVDC has, so far, raised about Rs 1,100 crores in debt issues. This is the first issue in the current year.

ICRA downgrades MSEB over Dabhol fracas

Rating agency ICRA has downgraded the rating assigned to Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB's) bond programmes aggregating to Rs 2,015 crore, from 'LAA-' (SO) to 'LA+' (SO). The rating has been placed under rating watch. ""The revised rating indicates adequate safety. The rating is based on the unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Government of Maharashtra (GoM),"" ICRA said. The revised rating reflects the continued uncertainty on the timing and likely manner of settlement of MSEB's payment dispute with Dabhol Power Company (DPC), and its impact on the financial position of MSEB and GoM. Though MSEB had stopped making payments to DPC, the latter had been sending monthly bills to the board. DPC had recently sent the August and September bills totalling Rs 209 crore. It had sent the bill arguing that the capacity payments will accrue every month. The downgrade has come at a time when the High Court decided to hear from December 11 a petition filed by DPC challenging the jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) to adjudicate its dispute with MSEB. ICRA has revised the rating asigned to the Rs 150 crore non-convertible debenture programme of Jindal Iron & Steel Company Limited (JISCO) to LA- (SO) from LAA- (SO). The rating has been placed under 'Rating Watch'. The revised rating indicates adequate safety. The rating is based and irrevocable guarantee from IFCI Limited for payment of principal and interest on the debentures.

'SCI can invest more in Greenfield', P. Manoj 

THE Shipping Ministry has no reservations on Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) investing another $11 million as its share to bridge the $55-million gap in the project cost of Greenfield Shipping Company. With less than a month left to take possession of the LNG tanker on the scheduled delivery date of November 15, the board of SCI has not been able to take a final view on sinking a further $11 million in proportion to its equity holding of 20 per cent in the joint venture consortium. Professional members on the board of SCI are not convinced by the arguments put forward by the company management on investing an extra $11 million and save the project from going into payment default..

These members have counter-argued that the project has turned unviable due to the uncertainty surrounding the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), making the prospect of earning the original charter hire rate of $98,600 per day look bleak. The Shipping Ministry, which controls the SCI, feels that the State-owned company has no other option but to invest the additional amount of $11 million and bail out the tanker from the clutches of the lenders. ``The SCI has two worst choices before it. One is to pump in another $11 million to save the project from going into default and earn a return of 4 to 5 per cent. The second option is to refuse further investment and earn no returns at all besides running the risk of losing its equity investment of $11 million. The SCI will have to make the best of the two worst choices,'' Government sources told Business Line. 

While the SCI will not invest the extra $11 million immediately, it is planning to issue a letter of comfort to Mitsui O.S.K.Lines, the lead partner in the consortium, stating that it was prepared to accept the liability in future. This will pave the way for Mitsui to put in the entire $55 million to bridge the gap in project cost and proceed with taking delivery of the LNG carrier. The amount given by Mitsui towards the share of the other two partners totalling $22 million ($11 million each for SCI and Atlantic Commercial Inc) will be in the form of a loan. In future, this amount will have to be reimbursed to Mitsui with interest. The Shipping Ministry feels that allowing bankers to confiscate the LNG vessel due to non-payment of the last tranche of project cost of $55 million would render SCI's equity investment of $11 million infructuous. On confiscation of the vessel, the bankers would immediately go about selling the vessel for recovering its investment of $110 million alongwith interest which otherwise would have been paid by the promoters over a period of time. ``Significantly, when you approach the market for selling a confiscated vessel, you won't even get the prevailing market price and would have to go for a distress sale,'' the sources said. 

So, for an LNG tanker ordered for $220 million, the bankers would not be able to realise even the prevailing price for new buildings which is hovering at around $160 to $170 million. Consequently, the bankers will recover their loan liability of $110 million with interest but the balance would be insufficient for the three promoters to recoup their equity investment in full. ``Given this scenario, there is no point in looking at whether the extra investment of the SCI would fetch the mandatory 12 per cent internal rate of return as stipulated by the Government for projects involving State-funding,'' the sources said. After providing $110 million for the project out of a total loan commitment of $165 million, the bankers led by ANZ Investment Bank had suspended the last tranche of the project loan of $55 million, declaring an event of default due to the controversy surrounding the project. The promoters of Greenfield Shipping Company can now take possession of the tanker only on paying the remaining $55 million. The tanker is being built to ferry LNG from Oman to DPC.

Enron Q3 net loss at $618m 

US energy major Enron, which has decided to quit India after facing trouble in the $2.9-billion Dabhol Power Project, on Thursday reported a $618-million net loss for the third quarter this year. Announcing the results in Houston, Enron CEO Kenneth Lay said the non-recurring charges totalling $1.01 billion after tax were recognised during the quarter which resulted in in a net loss of $618 million. ""After thorough review of our business, we have decided to take these charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings of our core energy business,"" Lay said. The company's total recurring net income increased to $393 million in third quarter against $292 million a year ago. ""Our 26 per cent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipeline,"" Lay said, affirming that the company was on the track to continue strong earnings growth and achieve its targets.( PTI )

Deshmukh Govt. completes a difficult two years, Mahesh Vijapurkar 

To the Maharashtra Chief Minister, Mr. Vilasrao Deshmukh, two years of running an eight-party coalition, despite a numerically strong over-anxious Opposition snipping at his heels, is in itself an achievement. The arrangement, in which the Congress(I) and the NCP are major partners, completes two years in office today. The key constituents of the Democratic Front (DF) had actually begun to show strains of running a coalition. At one point, the NCP, despite its mature leadership, dissociated itself from a Cabinet decision on the sensitive issue of setting up a probe against the Enron deal. To it, the timing was inappropriate. The Congress(I) couldn't hide its glee at the Government's discomfiture. 

The Congress(I) too is not averse to backing out from decisions. It agreed to the move to reconsider enforcing higher rates for water - irrigation, drinking, industrial and when water is a raw material, as in mineral water production - at the coordination committee meeting of all ruling parties, because of pressure from within and from the NCP. The NCP and the Congress(I) are aware of the limitations of coalition politics and would like to be in the driver's seat. The two have often said it was their duty to form a partnership to keep the BJP-Shiv Sena out of power. Or else, the State would have seen the saffron parties consolidate. Battling such odds is tough for all players, each with its own agenda on which they are unwilling to compromise. The Opposition scorns at the Government. Says Mr. Gopinath Munde, BJP leader: ``How can a Government backtrack on decisions like these? Can such a Government be considered credible? I think it is all in poor taste. Disowning collective responsibility is unconstitutional. I am saddened at this situation. This is no Government.'' 

Mr. Deshmukh says the Government is trying to limit the damage done to the State's finances by the predecessor dispensation of the BJP and the Shiv Sena. Once it became known that the Government was almost bankrupt, investment arrivals ceased. There has been no major investment for two years. To its credit, the Government has taken some brave decisions in two years: not paying bonus to Government employees whose salary accounts for Rs. 1,300 crores, cutting DA, banning the SIMI despite a coalition partner's objections and not budging when Enron rattled its sabre and, in fact, ceasing to buy power from it. But, unfortunately, it is the inter-party rivalry that draws the attention of the newspapers.

Dabhol seeks dismissal of MSEB's special leave petition, Sanjay Jog 

The Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in its counter affidavit has appealed to the Supreme Court to dismiss the special leave petition filed by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) against the Mumbai high court order with regard to invocation of letter of credit (L/C) of Rs 136 crore towards April power purchase bill by the DPC through its assignee, the Bank of America (BoA). The Supreme Court, which has stayed the Mumbai high court order on September 21, would hold hearing on November 2. However, MSEB in its reply has made it clear that it will face irrepairable loss and harm if DPC was allowed to draw a letter of credit. The invocation of letter of credit would also upset the financial equilibrium. ""DPC ought not to be permitted to upset the status quo and financial equilibrium as it now seeks to do particularly after Supreme Court order of September 21,"" the board said. 

The DPC has opposed the MSEB's pray to maintain status quo in view of May 29 order passed by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc) and later upheld by the high court and apex court with regard to reactivation of escrow account and proceed on international arbitration. According to the company, MSEB's claim of causing irrepairable harm in the wake of invocation of letter of credit was ""unsupported by reference to any factual basis."" The company has reiterated that the Merc was not a competent authority to adjudicate the dispute and difference between DPC and MSEB. ""Any attempt to preserve status quo by freezing all payments and suspending all operations will have a contrary effect. MSEB is refusing to pay any payments. It has not paid since early May 2001,"" the company said. 

However, MSEB has reiterated that the Merc's May 29 order has been issued keeping in view the interest of the power consumers of Maharashtra and its finding has not been disturbed by either Mumbai high court or Supreme Court. The Board has made out special equities. The DPC has reiterated its argument that the letter of credit was an independent contract and on June 21, 1999, it had irrevocably transferred its right under letter of credit to the Bank of America, which is a trustee as per the provisions of PPA. The Bank of America is likely to intervene in the matter and is expected to make a petition in this regard shortly. The letter of credit has been renewed from time to time. It was renewed on August 16, 2001 by the Canara Bank and its validity was extended up to May 2002. According to DPC, the invocation of letter of credit was necessary as sufficient funds would be made available in the onshore retention account to meet the debt service payment to be made to the lenders and meet DPC's other liabilities.

Judge name for Enron panel will be out in a week 

Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has described his two-year tenure as a tight rope walk. Addressing a district Congress meet at Satara on Saturday, Mr Deshmukh said: ""Running the government for the past two years has meant walking the tight rope. I learnt to keep an ice-pack on my head and put sugar in my mouth while carrying out my responsibilities. That is why I am constantly smiling while doing my work and there is nothing wrong with it. Since there is no money in the treasury, the development work is moving at a slow pace and this is a fact. To add to it, I have to run an eight-party coalition government where it is difficult to predict who would be satisfied with a decision and who would not."" He said the government would name a judge within a week for the judicial inquiry set up to probe the Enron imbroglio. ""I am committed that the truth about Enron should come forth for it will be in the interest of the people. Within a week, we will announce the name of the judge to head the inquiry. The Congress is strong enough to weather the consequence of this decision. Even if we have to lose the government because of our decision, we will have no regrets,"" he said. The Nationalist Congress Party, which is a member of the Democratic Front government, has been insisting that the appointment of the judge be deferred and the state, along with the Centre, hold negotiations with Enron to resolve the issue. The party had asked Mr Deshmukh to defer the inquiry by two months.

Maharashtra govt seeks Lord Alexander at ?500 per hour, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra government's woes vis-a-vis the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) continue to mount. Additional financial burden is on the cards for the state government to the extent of Rs 8 crore as payment towards the Queen's counsel and solicitors. This is to vacate the ex-parte order granted by the London High Court of Justice restraining it from filing any suit in Indian courts against the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. Senior state government sources told The Financial Express that the hunt is on for the appointment of a counsel based in London. And on the shortlist: leading Queen's Counsel Lord Alexander who is to be appointed soon. Sources said that Lord Alexander would plead the Maharashtra government's case before the London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench division, Commercial Court). 

But the good Lord Alexander's services come at a price. The state coffers are none-too-healthy. Efforts, therefore, are on so that Lord Alexander's services can be contracted at 500 sterling pounds per hour instead of the quoted 750 sterling pounds per hour. The state authorities, on their part, have appointed Messers DLA as its solicitors to provide back-up support to Lord Alaxander, and a resolution has already been issued to this extent. The government's solicitors in India, Rafiq Dada, Amit Harayani and Darious Khambata would brief DLA and Lord Alexander. According to sources, Messers DLA has also been appointed as solicitors for the government during the international arbitration proceedings initiated by DPC. The DPC has served arbitration notices for the violation of State Support Agreement, Supplemental State Support Agreement and Government of Maharashtra Guarantee. The hourly rates at which fees would be paid to DLA are as follows: senior partner 325 pounds, junior partner 300 pounds, senior advocate 235 pounds, assistant 180 pounds and paralegal/trainees at 100 pounds. These rates would be discounted at between five per cent to 10 per cent for lawyers in their offices outside London. The London court in its ex-parte order of October 10 has restrained the state government from filing any suit in the Indian court to challenge the international arbitration proceedings initiated by the DPC. 

Simultaneously, the government has been prohibited from filing any suit with regard to fraud against DPC. The DPC had earlier pointed out that the injunction ordered by the London court ""facilitates the timely and impartial review by the international arbitration panel of the dispute between DPC and Government of Maharashtra dealing with its failure to comply with its obligations under the state guarantee and the state support and supplemental state support agreements"". However, the anti-Enron lobby has alleged that the London's order has created a disadvantageous situation for the State where it would be unable to defend itself in the writ-petitions with respect to its disputes with the DPC and to which, it has been made a party pending before various courts and tribunals.

DPC for written undertaking from Maharashtra govt 

US energy major Enron's Dabhol Power Company has demanded a written undertaking from Maharashtra government stating that it will not file a civil suit against the multinational as it was not a party to the power purchase agreement.. ""Any attempt by the Government of Maharashtra to file a civil suit agaisnt DPC in which the Power Purchase Agreement is impeached, is precisely that which it undertook not to do as per the terms of the final consent award of December 1996"", DPC's legal firm Linklaters and Alliance have said in a letter dated October 16 to Maharashtra government's lawyers M/s Hariyani & Co.Referring to a media report, Linklaters has warned Maharashtra government that it was ""not and has not ever been a party to the power purchase agreement signed between DPC and Maharashtra State Electricty Board"".""Accordingly, any civil suit such as that being referred (in the media report) must relate to the agreement to which the GoM is party, namely the guarantees"", the letter said. The firm said, it wanted a ""written undertaking"" from GoM that it will not file a civil suit against DPC in respect of any disputes arising out or in connection with any three GoM agreements, but that any such dispute would be referred to arbitration in accordance with arbitration agreements. The media report has quoted the state as saying that Queen's Court in London did not enjoy jurisdiction to issue an injunction restraining it from filing a suit against in India against on-going international proceedings, Linklaters said. 

The US energy major's legal firm said, ""DPC simply could not understand how the state government is not enjoined from filing a civil suit against DPC of the sort described in the article"". The multinational has also filed a suit in the London Queen's Court alleging that GoM had breached the consent agreement which it had entered with itself in 1996. On October 10, DPC dealt a legal blow to Maharashtra by obtaining an injunction from Commerical Court of London, restraining the state from filing a suit in India challenging international arbitration proceedings to be held in UK. The injuction was obtained due to the state's failure to comply with its obligations under GoM guarantee dated February 10, 1994, state support agreement dated June 24, 1994 and supplemental state support agreement dated July 27, 1996. ""Over the last few months, Maharashtra and other government entities have taken actions to aviod complying with their contractual oblogations. This has frustrated the rights of international investors that were legally agreed to by the relevant parties several years ago"", DPC said. Meanwhile, the state administration is gearing up to present its case before the London commercial court with a team comprising of lawyers, state energy secretary V M Lal and MSEB chief Vinay Bansal leaving for London on October 29.

THE INDIAN EXPRESS, Monday, October 22, 2001
Why Enron needs to simply 'Lay Off', Ramesh Chauhan 

Surfing the net, the other day, I came across an interesting debate. It emanated from a comment made by the California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is investigating the energy crisis in that state and has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in reward for information about law breaking in the energy business. It is a comment that has had the gay rights groups, the prisoners' rights groups and assorted other civil liberties groups up in arms. But it has even more interesting import for India. So what is the comment anyway? Well talking about Enron and the way the energy major conducts its business Lockyer said, 'I would love to personally escort (Enron Corp chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, Hi honey! My name is Spike'. 

Remember, this is the AG of the State of California. Not some money grabbing, 'property expropriating' communist ideologue from a third world country. Does he know something that we in India don't? Enron Corp has its back to the wall and has made it abundantly clear that it is desperate to get out of India. Good riddance all of us would say, except for the caveats attached for this exit. It has been claimed the project has been financed using a combination of debt (about $2.2 billion odd) and the rest by equity. The equity number varies from time to time, but their claim is about billion plus, perhaps as much as 1.2 billion. Enron wants the equivalent of 1.2 billion odd dollars (about Rs 6,000 crore) to make an exit. On the face of it this would seem to be a perfectly reasonable argument. After all as a businessmen, if I want to exit a project mid-way, the least I expect the buyer to pay is what I have invested in the project. But herein lies the problem. 

If these numbers were correct, then the project cost of Dabhol is now adds up about $3.4 billion that is, the equivalent of $1.7 million per MW. This would have the dubious honour of the MOST expensive gas fired power station in the history of the world and winning the honours without even a close competitor. Let us keep the Enron issue aside for a minute and look at three power plants that were set up over the last eight years in our part of the world. Seoinchon, Korea has a 2,000 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant. In every technical sense, it is a clone of the Dabhol Plant. The same GE STAG 207FA turbines are being used, as those in the Dabhol plant. Guess what is the cost of the plant? $900 million or $0.45 million/MW! Less than a third of the Dabhol cost. 

Again in Korea, construction of the 2,000 MW combined cycle gas turbine plant at Poryong began in 1996 and the plant was commissioned in 1999. And the price. $850 million or $0.425 million/MW! Interestingly, the efficiency of the Pryong power plant is 60 per cent, while that of Dabhol is effectively 48 per cent. As recently as this month, Malaysian state-owned utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd signed a PPA to buy power from Malakoff Bhd for its 640-MW project. The project's cost are estimated at about $370 million or about $0.58/MW. This is slightly higher than the other two examples, but bigger plant would always be cheaper due to efficiencies of size. Prayas, a tiny, three-member NGO from Pune, has studied project costs of about 40,000 MW of power projects between 1991 and 1998. The average project cost was in the region of $0.6 million/MW and this included small 30 MW plants as well. 

As a businessman, the cost of electricity matter to me to run my business efficiently. The main reason for my interest in the subject is the ridiculously high cost of power and the decline of competitiveness on this among other reasons. As a matter of interest, the energy from the Malaysian PPA is slated to be delivered at energy prices of about 3.2 cents/kWh under a 21-year PPA that is about Rs 1.54/unit. This represents the cheapest power on this side of the world and less than a one-third of both Enron as well as the price my plants pay today. So let us look at the calculations for investment in Dabhol again. $900 million is cost of an identical plant (the first Korean one of the same size and using identical turbines that is nearly a clone). 'Wait a minute,' you may ask me here, 'but did Enron not spend more money.' Yes we would probably need to factor some 'additional' costs. 

Let us add the cost of the LNG jetty, the regassification terminal and other add ons. (By the way these had very little to do with the Dabhol Power Plant. The LNG jetty was to the cornerstone of Enron's energy distribution business in India. But like any good supplier Enron billed all of it's costs to its client-Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)- which like any good public sector unit agreed to pay for things it did not need in the first place). Even with these add ons, the capital costs (proportionately) to MSEB ought not exceed $1.2 billion. Now doing business in India is particularly difficult. As Enron itself said, it had to spend a lot of money to 'educate' Indian decision makers. ('Educating' IDBI and ICICI on how to lend. So let us assume that the cost of doing business in India is an additional one or two per cent of project costs -two per cent in this case, adds another 24 million-Enron had of course claimed about 20 million in these 'additional' costs (in other words 'over and above project costs'-the now infamous 'education monies' of 20 million). The figure does not budge. 1,224 million. This represents a difference of 250 odd per cent! 

Let me be more generous and add, on say another 30 per cent to this-say $400 million. ($400 million is a very large number by the way, in today rupee terms nearly Rs 2,000 crore) for completely arbitrary costs. But this still brings us to $1,600 million odd. One would think the number above, $1,600 million, would be the cost of the project. However, we are not even close. Enron has claimed project costs to be nearly $3,400 million. I can think of perhaps a difference of a few per cent, but over a 100 per cent? The explanation perhaps lies in a little story that was related to a friend of mine. A few years ago, he was a consultant to an industrialist setting up a steel plant. He was looking at the numbers and felt that they did not add up. The industrialist put his head back, laughed and said, 'No one puts up projects in India so that you can make money after the project is commissioned and product starts selling. You put up a project so that you can make money while the project is being implemented'. 

I suspect that is exactly what has happened in the Enron project. The missing $1.7 billion odd has been probably siphoned off by over invoicing and other time honoured tricks. In other words, Enron has already recovered all its money that it had invested and also made a very generous return on the money it actually invested. At this stage, instead of demanding money at all, Enron should be worrying about returning the siphoned money in equity, perhaps about $400 million, and additionally, the $400 million it owes MSEB a result of the breach of its contractual obligations. To summarise, an equitable settlement at this stage would be that Enron pays us $800 million (about Rs 3,800 crore) and in return, we agree to forget the whole issue! Three days after the tragic events of September 11, when not only America but the entire world was in a state of deep shock, Lay ought to be told to stop screaming 'expropriation' and threatening sanctions on us. Instead he ought to be grateful for small mercies, count the money he has already made and simply lay off. Otherwise he may have to worry about some Indian prosecution.

MSEB asked to rescind tariff hike plan, Vidyadha Date

The Maharashtra government has been announcing subsidy on electricity sold to farmers, powerloom owners and other categories but not actually passing on the benefit to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the distribution agency. This has added to the financial problems of MSEB. The dues to be given to MSEB run into hundreds of crores of rupees. It includes a subsidy of Rs 700 crore for farmers, Rs 300 crores for powerloom operators, Rs 600 crore to municipal bodies for use of power for water supply and Rs 215 crore for the Mula Pravara cooperative electric distribution society.The chairperson of MSEB Vinay Bansal has appealed to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission to ask the government to pay the arrears to MSEB. Mr Bansal was responding to opposition voiced by a number of representatives of domestic, commercial and powerloom consumers before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) against the proposed power tariff? hike by MSEB. If it recovered the arrears and reduced its losses, MSEB could manage very well without any tariff increase, they said.Mr Bansal said the board suffered from various constraints. It could not cut off the power supply of municipal bodies because this would be in conflict with public interest. He said the board had improved its performance in various ways. There had been no load shedding in the past one week, he said. There had been no increase in arrears in the past one year as against the previous two years. MERC chairperson P. Subrahmanyam observed that the board was `more sinned against than sinning.' Its job was not easy and it could not improve its performance overnight, he said.

Experts during their submissions strongly opposed MSEB's move to increase tariff every year. S.R. Paranjpe, a former director of the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research, Kalapakkam, said his techno-economic evaluation of MSEB's working revealed several shortcomings and lapses. He said the board deliberately created the impression of a power shortage in the state last year in a bid to justify its purchase of power from Dabhol Power of Enron at exorbitant rates. The board resorted to deliberate load shedding as part of this exercise and in the process it lost revenue. Besides, sections which were getting? subsidised power were deprived of the supply. The power stations also? performed at an `under frequency' level posing several problems. The board should have resorted to demand and supply management. It should have asked farmers to consume power at night when the supply was easily available.When Dabhol company's power supply was reduced, MSEB's generation suddenly went up. This shows that earlier the board had deliberately operated below capacity. MSEB was disconnecting power supply to many consumers to show that it was taking action against defaulters. Yet, the consumption of power by consumers in these categories had gone up. It means, some consumers drew power from their neighbours unauthorisedly or resorted to some other means.

The small fry among them were being penalised while the big fish were being allowed to scot free, Mr Paranjpe said. Pradyumna Kaul, a management consultant and environmentalist, said MSEB had failed to improve its performance on the lines suggested by MERC last year. S.C. Karandikar, appearing on behalf of the Bhiwandi citizens' welfare society, complained that powerloom owners in Bhiwandi were unjustifiably being given a bad name. He faulted the MSEB on several counts and showed photographs depicting the sorry state of transformers in the town. He also complained that Bhiwandi experienced daily power cuts for three hours in morning and three hours in evening.He said transmission and distribution losses of the board had gone up, though the commission had stipulated last year that they be brought down. Some consumers also alleged that the MSEB was claiming subsidy from the government even for power not supplied to subsidised consumers. Pratap Hogade, vice-president of state Janata Dal (secular), called for? rejection of the entire tariff proposal. It was wrong to penalise consumers for the inadequacies of the board, he said. The board's deficit and its expenditure had gone up instead of going down. The commission should not allow frequent tariff revisions. More reprehensible, he said, was that the board had sought to effect the maximum increase for ordinary consumers, including domestic users, small traders, farmers and gram panchayats. Those using two or three bulbs face an increase of almost 250 per cent, Mr Hogade said.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Indian lenders to take over IFCI's exposure in DPC
 
IDBI-led consortium of Indian lenders to Enron's Dabhol Power Company, has agreed ""in-principle"" to take over IFCI's exposure in the troubled project following expiry of the deadline given by Japanese Export Credit Agency to encash the counter guarantees. ""We have already in-principle agreed to provide a counter-guarantee for the loan given by any member of the consortium, if its capital adequacy ratio dives below the prescribed Reserve Bank of India's norm"", senior IDBI official said. Last month, alarmed by DPC's default towards interest payments to its foreign and domestic lenders, JBIC had warned its Indian counterparts that it would be compelled to encash their guarantees after October 26, 2001, if IFCI's exposure of Rs 454 crore was not covered by other FIs. ""We will communicate to JBIC that after infusion of Rs 1,000 crore by the Union government in IFCI, the FI's car will increase to 9 per cent and trigger point has not yet arrived whereby the Japanese agency could encash the guarantees,"" the official said. He said the issue would be discussed at length at DPC's lenders meet to be held on November 2, 2001, and three in London. ""The Indian lenders will try and impress upon JBIC that IFCI is out of danger and there is no dire need for taking over its exposure in the present circumstances,"" he added.

Enron fires finance director

US energy major Enron has ousted its finance director amid an investigation by the American government into the company's business practices. Finance director Andrew Fastow would take a leave of absence and be replaced by Jeffrey McMahon, former treasurer, the company said. ""In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy,"" said Enron chairman Kenneth Lay. Billions of dollars worth of transactions between Enron and ""limited partnerships"" controlled by Fastow were being examined by the Securities & Exchange Commission, a report in the Times daily said on Friday. Enron, based in Houston, has annual revenues of more than $100 billion, and is involved in a quarter of US' electricity and natural gas trades. Fastow's departure follows the abrupt resignation of Jeff Skilling as chief executive in August for ""personal reasons"". 
Lay, who is thought to have played a role in US President George W Bush's decision to drop the Kyoto accord on global warming, was brought out of retirement once again to lead Enron. Shares in Enron hit a six-year low on Wednesday due to the SEC investigation coupled with a $618-million third-quarter loss and $1-billion charge for failed investments.

Reliance shelves LNG project, Anto T Joseph 

THE DABHOL imbroglio and the current uncertainty in the liquefied natural gas market has forced the Reliance Group to put its $5-billion LNG project on the backburner. 

The petroleum and petrochemicals major had signed an MoU in February 2001 with British Petroleum and National Iranian Oil Company, for an eight-million tonne per annum LNG project. The decision to slow down implementation of the LNG project is believed to have taken after the Reliance-BP-NIOC consortium completed a feasibility study for the proposed project. 

Reliance and BP would hold a 25 per cent stake each in the project, and the remaining stake will be with NIOC if and when the project is implemented. A Reliance spokesperson, however, said the company was going ahead with the project. The Reliance gameplan was to upgrade capacity at its Jamnagar terminal. The Jamnagar port is ideally equipped to handle LNG as there is no need for building costly breakwater and dredging facilities, which makes LNG handling much more economical and competitive. 

The proposed project is the largest so far in India and a whole network consisting of the liquefaction plant, regassification plant, LNG terminal and transportation facilities was supposed to come up. 

Sources said Reliance was finding it difficult to put in place contracts and agreements because of the lack of potential end users. 

""After Enron's Dabhol Power Company ran into a severe payment crisis, in the process exposing the unviability of LNG as an alternate fuel for base load plant, India is unlikely to see setting up of any LNG-based projects. Many LNG players i who have already executing their projects, but have suddenly found themselves saddled with many problems,"" said an industry source.

Trouble in Enron drives online energy trade to the edge, Gelu Sulugiuc 

ENRON almost daily revelations of fresh troubles has prompted concerns its powerful position in online energy trading could prompt a credit crunch and rock the fast-growing industry. Though experts said yesterday that EnronOnline, Enron's Web trading platform, should survive, investors are skittish about the No 1 US natural gas and electricity marketer. 

Since last week Enron has shed more than $13 billion in market value as shares plunged, forcing it on Wednesday to replace its chief financial officer, who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. 

In the latest blow, credit rating agency Fitch yesterday placed Enron debt securities on negative credit watch, saying the erosion of investor confidence, if unabated, would impair the company's access to capital markets. 

""We put them on a list of concerns two months ago and made sure our books were balanced just as the first stage of precaution,"" said one energy trader active on EnronOnline. About 60 per cent of all transactions by Enron are captured through EnronOnline, and so far traders have kept faith. 

On Wednesday, EnronOnline - in which trades always involve Enron as either the buyer or seller - conducted 8,000 transactions through its site, with a notional value of $4 billion, more than daily its average of $3.5 billion. 

""People are transacting at higher levels as they prepare their portfolios for the winter and to protect themselves from price volatility,"" said Vance Meyer, an Enron spokesman. 

Not even Enron itself anticipated the success of EnronOnline, which enjoys the highest volume of any platform in the cut-throat field of Internet energy trade. Initially, the company set a yearly trading volume target of $30 billion to 40 billion - business it now does in 10 days alone. 

Yet traders worry Enron's spectacular fall from grace could make it a less solid counterparty in certain eyes after transactions with two limited parterships run by Andrew Fastow sparked investigations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Enron replaced Fastow as its CFE on Wednesday in the hope it would restore investor confidence. 

""I haven't seen any sign of them slowing down or not making a good market on EnronOnline, but until things get squared away, I will keep a tight leash on the credit issue,"" one trader said. ""The only thing that bothers me is it takes a lot of capital to do what they're doing, and with the stock price down, I wonder how much credit they have left,"" he added. 

Enron said this week that it can tap a $3.35 billion credit line to support its trading and marketing business, which can experience wide swings in cash flow depending on commodity prices. 

""In the event of a 'push-comes-to-shove' liquidity crunch, we believe the company could generate substantial cash by selling a variety of other assets,"" said Ron Barone, an analyst at UBS Warburg. 

If EnronOnline does lose steam, the big winner will be its main rival Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) - which already routinely trades more than $1 billion a day. ""This (recent news) shows there may be some kinks in the armor and some people may stop using EnronOnline,"" said Kyle Cooper, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""Clearly ICE could benefit or any other alternative online platform."" 

EnronOnline is still a force to be reckoned with, experts said. ""Enron clearly will survive and EnronOnline will still remain a dominant force"" in Internet energy trading, said Barone. Nonetheless, traders are playing it safe. (Reuters

Petronet LNG may up enhance Dahej capacity

PETRONET LNG, a joint venture of four public sector oil and gas majors, is considering doubling the capacity of its under-construction Dahej liquefied natural gas terminal in Gujarat to 10 million tonnes. 

""We are considering a proposal of doubling the present 5 million tonnes capacity of Dahej terminal as we see tremendous demand in the future,"" said Suresh Mathur, chief executive officer and managing director, Petronet LNG. 

While the subject is under study, Petronet LNG will firm up plans once the Dahej terminal nears completion. A joint venture of Oil & Natural Gas Corporation, Gas Authority of India, Bharat Petroleum and IndianOil, Petronet LNG is planning another terminal of 2.5 million tonnes capacity at Kochi in Kerala. 

French gas major Gaz de France and RasGas of Qatar, which will supply LNG to the terminals for a 25-year period beginning 2003, also hold equity stake in the Petronet LNG. The Dahej project involves the construction of a regasification terminal, a liquefaction train in Qatar to be built by RasGas and two methane tankers. A consortium led by Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries of Japan is executing the $317-million engineering, procurement and construction contract at Dahej. 

Work on the Dahej terminal, expected to begin operation by December 2003, was progressing on schedule and on cost, said Mathur. ""Around 2,000 people have been mobilised for the construction of the jetty and storage tanks."" 

The capacity enhancement would involve construction on an additional storage tank with an investment of around $70 million. While Petronet LNG has the option to acquire the 5-million-tonne capacity Dhabol LNG terminal of US energy major Enron Corporation, Mathur denied there were any such plan. 

Enron's LNG terminal at Dabhol was set up to supply regassified LNG to Dabhol Power Corporation for use in its power plant, and the remainder to other bulk users. In the wake of the tussle over power dues with Maharashtra State Electric Board, one of the partners in Dabhol Power, Enron is trying to sell off both projects. 

Indian consumption of natural gas has risen faster than any other fuel in recent years. From only 0.6 trillion cubic feet per year in 1995, natural gas use was nearly 0.8 Tcf in 1999 and is projected to reach 1.3 Tcf in 2005 and 1.8 Tcf in 2010. 

With domestic gas production far short of demand, India is encouraging projects for import of LNG. The government is of the view that the dozen or so terminal projects in the pipeline would be able to meet the needs of gas-fired electric power plants and bring down the cost of power generation.

THE TIMES OF INDIA, Saturday, October 27, 2001
Lenders to meet over Enron's Dabhol on Nov 3 
 Lenders to power plant in India majority owned by Enron have called a meeting next week in London to discuss ways of reviving the beleaguered project, a banking source said on Saturday. They will examine offers that two Indian companies have put forward for buying the US energy giant's 65 per cent stake, and those of two other US firms, in Dabhol Power Company, which is building the controversial project, the source said.

The meeting of lenders, who include multinational banks such as Citibank, Bank of America, will be held on November 3, the source added. At stake is not just the fate of the $2.9 billion, 2,184 MW project, which is India's largest foreign direct investment, but also the over $600 million investment of Enron, General Electric and Bechtel. All three companies are founders of DPC, which in 1995 got permission from India's Maharashtra state government to set up the plant on its coast.

The plant's first phase of 740 MW was completed in 1999, but work on the second phase of 1,444 MW, which is 97 per cent complete, was abruptly stopped in June this year following a blazing row with cash-strapped state utility MSEB.

MSEB, which agreed in 1995 to take the plant's entire output, said it can no longer do so because Dabhol's power is too costly. Dabhol, in turn, accused MSEB of defaulting on its monthly payments and served a preliminary notice to terminate the power purchase contract.

Under this notice, both companies are given six months time to settle the matter through negotiations. If talks fail, Dabhol has the right to issue a final termination notice and take the matter to arbitration in London. That six month period expires on November 19.

Houston-based Enron, which owns 65 per cent of Dabhol, further announced that it intends to exit the project and offered to sell its equity to the Indian government.

TIME RUNNING OUT

The Business Standard newspaper reported that next week's meeting would also discuss a request by Dabhol to finally terminate the contract after November 19.

""It is one of the items on the agenda,"" the paper quoted a senior banker as saying. The paper said once Dabhol serves the final notice, the matter proceeds to arbitration, which would not help India. ""The widespread view among the government and lenders is that in such a situation DPC will win hands down,"" the paper added.

A Dabhol spokesman could not be contacted immediately. The source said the meeting would review the progress made in resolving the dispute so far.

The Indian government has not responded to Enron's offer to buy its equity, but two Indian companies, BSES and Tata Power, have shown interest.  They have agreed to take over the project if the cost is reduced, and if the founders agree to sell their stake at a discount.

Local business daily, the Economic Times reported on Friday that Tata Power and BSES are willing to pay the founders $450-$600 million for the 85 per cent stake held by Enron, GE and Bechtel.

Enron has rejected the offer and is not ready to settle for anything less than $1 billion, the paper added. Officials of Tata Power and BSES were not immediately available for comment.( REUTERS )

Loans to DPC based on MSEB's letter of credit: Bank of America
 
Bank of America (BoA), which is the onshore trustee for the secured parties of Dabhol Power Company (DPC), in an application before the Supreme Court, has said that the secured lenders in making their loans to the ""distressed"" 2,184 mw Dabhol project has relied on the validity of the letter of credit (L/C) established by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and the non-payment under the L/C would inevitably result in non-payment of the lender's debt. The trustee submitted that ""had the secured lenders known that the MSEB would seek to prevent the honouring of the L/C, they would not have made the loans to the project."" 

The BoA in its application has appealed to the Supreme Court (SC) to implead it as a respondent in the special leave petition (SLP) filed by the MSEB on September 17 challenging the Mumbai High Court allowing the DPC to invoke the L/C of Rs 136 crore for the recovery of the April bill from MSEB. The BoA has prayed that the SC should dismiss the MSEB's SLP and also vacate its (Supreme Court) order of September 21 staying the Mumbai High Court order. The BoA has pooh-poohed MSEB's argument that it would suffer irreparable harm if payment under the L/C was made. ""The trustee respectfully submits that harm to MSEB is not a relevant consideration to the payment by Canara Bank to the trustee under the L/C which is a separate contract made and assigned before the controversy arose between the MSEB and DPC."" 

The BoA has reiterated its plea that the SC, which would hold a hearing on November 2, should dismiss MSEB's SLP and grant interim relief as it would be directly affected by any order passed by the apex court. In this case, the trustee as beneficiary has sought to draw funds (Rs 136 crore) payable to it under the irrevocable L/C dated May 12, 1999 and signed by Canara Bank, which has not disputed its obligation to pay. The Mumbai High Court in its September 14 order properly determined that under settled principles of Indian law governing L/C, no injunction can be issued absent ""extraordinary circumstances that require clear proof by the beneficiary and knowledge of clear fraud by the issuing bank.""

Enron in talks with banks over new credit line 

NEW YORK: Enron Corp, which has been seeking to curb fears that it faces a credit crunch, is talking to its banks about a new, multi-billion-dollar credit line, the Wall Street Journal online edition reported on Friday.

The report comes after Enron said on late Thursday that it had drawn on its committed lines of credit to provide more than $ 1 billion in cash liquidity. The Journal said the company had drawn down about $3 billion, the majority of its available bank credit lines.

The Journal said on Friday that the company will use most of the money drawn from its credit lines to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of outstanding commercial paper.

Enron CFO Jef McMahon said in a statement on Thursday that the decision to draw on the credit lines was designed to alleviate concerns about the company's liquidity.

On Wednesday, Enron was forced to replace its former CFO, Andrew Fastow, who was linked to transactions now under investigation by government regulators. There have been disclosures that the company did off-the-balance sheet transactions with two limited partnerships run by Fastow in deals the SEC is now looking into for possible conflict of interest.( REUTERS )

Anti-Enron lobby takes a knock as state excludes Aney from lawyers panel, Sanjay Jog

The anti-Enron lobby has received a major setback following the Maharashtra government's decision not to include senior advocate Shrihari Aney's name in the panel of lawyers which would brief the state's solicitors DLA and the Queen's counsel Lord Alexander to challenge the London court's ex-parte order restraining the government from filing any suit in the Indian court or tribunal against the international arbitration proceedings initiated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC). The state government's panel would comprise of its solicitors Rafiq Dada, Amit Harayani and Darious Khambata. The team would leave for London in the first week of November. State government sources told The Financial Express that Mr Dada, Mr Harayani and Mr Khambata would brief the government's solicitor DLA and its Queen's counsel Lord Alexander. The government was in the process of preparing its petition challenging the October 10 order of London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court). Sources said that the axe has fallen on Mr Aney following his outburst against the government on September 18 for exclusion of fraud in the proposed civil suit to be filed against DPC in the Mumbai high court. Mr Aney's views in this regard has been publicly supported by the anti Enron lobby which had alleged that certain forces in the government were ""diluting"" the Dabhol suit. Mr Aney, who had withdrawn his resignation as the government's counsel after his meeting with the state energy minister Padmasinh Patil, had stressed the need for including fraud, issues related to public interest, public policy and absence of legal sanction in the civil suit ""in order to put forward a complete, fruitful and effective case against the DPC."" Analysts believe that the government did not want to face further embarrassment and decided to drop Mr Aney's name from its panel visiting London. The DPC in its defence had quaoted Mr Aney's observations before the London High Court of Justice (Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court) before seeking an injunction. According to DPC, ""there are some indications as to state government's intended position in the Indian press reports. In particular, it appears that the state government are void and to reply upon grounds of fraud, public policy, public interest and misrepresentation."" Quoting the newspaper report, the DPC said ""the state government's lawyer was reported as proposing a broad based suit which should pray that the high court declare the three contracts with DPC as unforceable and void and that this argument should be based on a number of factors. ""DPC made material misrepresentation to MSEB about the plant's capabilities.

BG offers ONGC equity in Brazil for Mukta-Panna, Soma Banerjee 

BRITISH Gas (BG) has offered ONGC equity in its exploration acreage in Brazil and a settlement in the cash call dispute in lieu for the operatorship of the Tapti Panna and Mukta oilfields which is being claimed by ONGC and Reliance following the sale of Enron's equity to BG. The Britain-based gas major had set a deadline of October 31 to settle the issue over operatorship. 

In return for the package BG has asked ONGC towaive its right to seek the removal of EOGIL, acquired by British Gas, asoperator following the change of control. The operatorship of the fields are a crucial issue to all the equity holders as it is an extra source of revenue. Niger Shaw, the vice-president BG India had said that the deal to buy out Enron Oil and Gas India 30 per cent stake would fall through if BG was not given the operatorship of the oilfields. 

EOGIL was the operator of these fields and BG had bought the company with the understanding that the operatorship of the field would be transferred to the new equity holder. However, both ONGC and Reliance the other equity holders in the project have staked claim to the operatorship. The production sharing committee has entailed that the issue of operatorship has to be decided on a consensus by the equity holders of the project. 

Shaw also confirmed that negotiations were on with both the equity holders and BG would put down what it could offer in return. However, still the discussions were still being held, he declined to give any details. BG, which has sealed this deal for a whopping $388 million and is hoping to expand its capacity by investing $250 million, is trying to make its offer lucrative so as to waive the opposition by ONGC and Reliance. 

In a recent communication to ONGC the company has assured its commitment to the adoption of a very different style of working, imposed in the past. Further, in order to ensure that the two companies have a good working relation, BG has made an offer to ONGC by which the latter could have a greater involvement in the operation of the fields.

US regulators probing Enron deals, stock slides 20 pc
Shares of Enron Corp slumped more than 20 per cent on Monday after it said US regulators are looking into some of its transactions, the latest in a series of blows for the company whose new chief executive officer resigned unexpectedly in August. A spokesman for North America's biggest buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity declined to discuss a request for information by the US Securities Exchange Commission, but said it was cooperating. The SEC also declined to provide details. Investor confidence in the company has been rocked by recent reports in The Wall Street Journal about transactions between Enron and two limited partnerships that were run until recently by Enron's Chief Financial officer, Andrew Fastow. The Journal said the deal raised ""conflict-of-interest"" questions but Enron has rejected any such suggestion, saying the deals were disclosed in SEC filings and approved by its board and internal and external auditors. A former Wall Street favourite that has fallen from grace during the last 12 months, Enron reported its first quarterly loss in more than four years last week after taking $1.01 billion in charges and writedowns on ill-fated investments. Enron has suffered a series of high-profile setbacks, ranging from problems at its broadband telecommunications business, a payments dispute at an Indian power plant project and the departure of CEO Jeff Skilling after only six months in the job. Its stock closed down $5.40, or almost 21 per cent, at $ 20.65, slicing $4.1 billion from its market capitalisation and making it the New York Stock Exchange's biggest percentage loser of the day. At one point the shares fell below $20 for the first time in 46 months. Monday's slide followed heavy losses for Enron's stock last week.

AES approaches Indian govt for payment dues

AFTER Enron, it is the turn of US-based AES to seek the Indian Prime Minister's help to settle its grievances with the Orissa government. In a letter to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, AES president Dennis W Bakke said his company's determination to continue in India was being tested by the government of Orissa . The letter, a copy of which was made available to The Associated Press on Tuesday, was dated October 1, and appeared to have been faxed to the office of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. The Virginia-based energy company operates two power plants in Orissa, holds 49 per cent of the Orissa Power Generation Corp and manages the main power distribution company in the state. AES is the other major American power company besides Enron to have made big investments in India after the government allowed foreign investment in the power sector in the early 1990s. In his letter, Bakke drew Vajpayee's attention to the ""expropriation, repeated contract violations, intimidation ... and direct interference with day-to-day management"" by the state government and its agencies.The letter also complained about government-run agencies failing to pay Rs 210 crore ($44 million) in bills. 

""If the situation faced by AES is not remedied urgently, it will undermine the trust and confidence of foreign investors in India,"" Bakke wrote. ""While AES still remains committed to India as a country it would very much like to serve, our determination to continue is being tested."" The Prime Office said it was not ready to comment on the report. Officials of the Orissa government were not available to respond to Bakke's charges in view of a Hindu festival. AES has already offered to withdraw from the distribution company -- known as the Central Electricity Supply Company of Orissa. However, it has said that the company will continue with its interests in electricity generation. If AES decides to pull out completely, it will the third American company to do so. Cogentrix quit a power project in southern India before it was started, while Houston-based Enron is in the process of withdrawing from the Dabhol Power Project, India's biggest-ever foreign investment project, in Maharashtra. On September 14, Enron chairman Kenneth L Lay wrote a letter to Vajpayee threatening legal action to pursue claims of up to $5 billion relating to the Dabhol Power dispute and questioned India's ability to honor its contracts. Lay had also warned that India may find it hard to attract foreign investors in the future because of the payment dispute with the Dabhol project, which stopped production and construction in May.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Dabhol agrees to due diligence: BSES chief 

THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has agreed to the due diligence of its 2,184-MW project, Mr R.V. Shahi, Chairman and Managing Director, BSES Ltd, has said. The DPC management has agreed to facilitate the due diligence but has asked us (Tata Power and BSES Ltd) to enter a confidentiality agreement with the company, which is only fair, Mr Shahi told newspersons on the sidelines of a seminar here on Wednesday. He said Tata Power and BSES had received a draft of the confidentiality agreement from DPC soon after they submitted their proposal to buy the power project, at the Singapore meeting. An issue like valuation and share transfer cannot be done unless the buyers get to examine details. Due diligence is a pre-requisite for the sale process to continue, Mr Shahi said. He said the companies would sign the confidentiality clause within the next two-three weeks while the due diligence process will take about six-eight weeks. Lenders to DPC, foreign sponsors, prospective buyers, the Centre, and other interested parties had met in Singapore earlier this month to discuss the sale of the company. The DPC spokesperson declined comment on the matter. Next week, DPC officials are scheduled to meet its other offshore sponsors General Electric and Bechtel which hold 30 per cent stake each in DPC, to discuss the sale of the asset.

DPC sponsors meet in US next week to discuss due diligence (Carried only by the online edition)

 SENIOR officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three foreign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company, will meet in Houston next week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of due diligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Power Company and BSES. ""The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given their go-ahead for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence due diligence. They are scheduled to meet before this month-end to decide their next step regarding the Dabhol project,"" sources close to the sponsors said here on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the development. Sources said the sponsors' decision would be conveyed to the Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian lenders by first week of December. ""Contradictory to recent announcements by Indian lenders and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to sign the confidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will, after all, depend on the three foreign sponsors' approval,"" they pointed out. Both Tatas and BSES would need their approval and cooperation to commence due diligence, sources emphasised.

Tata Power Ltd managing director Adi Engineer confirmed they were yet to commence DPC due diligence. ""We are waiting to sign the confidentiality agreement with DPC sponsors after which Tata Power Ltd would take at least a few months to complete the process,"" Adi Engineer said. Sources termed the meet as ""critical"" in deciding the future course of events in resolving the issues surrounding the $3-billion power project. ""Enron, GE and Bechtel had raised the issue of continuing costs of fundings during the three-day marathon Singapore meet, risen as a result of the Indian and foreign lenders' refusal to disburse additional funds,"" they informed. The proposed due-diligence was expected to take another two-three months, sources said, adding situation had become ""more fragile"" with Maharashtra State Electricity Board not drawing power since May 29 and lenders stopping disbursements to the 2,814-mw project March onwards. ""This has resulted in the beleaguered DPC also being unable to meet its loan repayment commitments in September and October,"" they added. During the Singapore meet, the three foreign sponsors had also expressed their grave concern about bearing additional expenses as the due diligence process would take its own time and incur significant costs, only adding to deterioration of assets and their cost burden, the sources said.

Yesterday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing director R V Shahi had announced that the company was likely to complete the due diligence of the Dabhol project by January end next year. Shahi said BSES has returned the draft of confidentiality agreement with comments to DPC. BSES would appoint three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence along with an internal task force to do parallel ground work, he said. (PTI)

'Enron may sell Dabhol at half price', WASHINGTON (Carried only by the online edition)

EMBATTLED US power major Enron may be forced to sell its stake in the Dabhol power plant at around half a billion dollars instead of the asking price of a billion dollars, a report here said. Tata Power and BSES, the Indian bidders for Enron's stake in the 2184 mw Dhabol Power Plant were reportedly willing to pay only half of the asking price which stood over a billion dollars, the New York Times reported. If the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take it or leave it line, Enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and swallow a huge loss on a controversial project which one gleamed with promise, it said. ""It is bound to be a distress sale,"" one banker told the paper. Though Enron's chairman and chief executive Kenneth L Lay was earlier quoted as saying that India would have to face economic sanctions if the government did not create a favourable climate for the sale of Enron's stake, the paper said ""Enron now will find little lobbying traction in either Washington or New Delhi"". ""The coalition-building diplomacy of the war in Afghanistan makes it unlikely that the Bush administration would agree to press India on Enron's behalf,"" the paper said.( PTI )

THE ECONOMIC TIMES, Thursday, November 22, 2001
Enron crisis deepens, bankruptcy looms (Carried only by the online edition)

The crisis of confidence ravaging cash-strapped Enron deepened on Wednesday amid mounting concerns that a proposed rescue by rival Dynegy could fall through, threatening the energy giant with bankruptcy. While the Houston-based energy giant said it secured the remaining $450 million of a new $1 billion credit line and pushed back the deadline for repaying a $690 million debt, its shares fell a further 28 per cent, after falling 23 per cent on Tuesday. ""If Dynegy steps away entirely from the merger, Enron's credit situation seems untenable with a bankruptcy filing highly possible,"" rating agency Fitch Investors said. UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone said, ""Bankruptcy would not be out of the question if the merger fell through or ran into obstacles."" ""We believe the odds of Enron incurring a material adverse change on its operations is soaring,"" Barone said in a research note, saying that Dynegy may invoke clauses allowing it to walk away from or alter the terms of the $9 billion agreement. In a statement, Enron said it was in feverish talks with its other lenders to restructure its debt obligations and reaffirmed its commitment to the Dynegy deal. ""We continue to believe that this merger is in the best interests of our shareholders, employees, and lenders,"" Enron chairman and chief Executive Ken Lay said. JP Morgan Chase vice chairman James Lee said in the same statement that Chase believes its interests and those of Enron and its other primary lenders are aligned, and that the bank would ""develop a plan to strengthen Enron's financial position up to and through its merger with Dynegy.""

SHARES HIT 1989 LEVELS
Enron's shares fell $1.98, or 28 per cent, to close at $5.01. It was the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange for the second day in a row. The shares had dipped as low as $4.58 earlier in the day, rebounding slightly after Enron's announcement. Accounting for stock splits, that is the lowest Enron has been since February 1989. Dynegy shares were off $1.94, or 4.65 per cent, at $39.76. Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he is encouraged by the new loan and debt extension. He said in a statement that Dynegy was working to ""accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger"". Watson said ChevronTexaco, which owns 26 per cent of Dynegy, reiterated its ""full confidence"" in Dynegy's ability to complete the merger. Privately, analysts were calling the odds of success lower since Enron made a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday alerting investors to its credit crunch.

Most analysts interviewed by Reuters called the chances even, where earlier they had called odds of success at 60-70 per cent. However, one analyst said he thought emotion was driving the current stock moves, and that it comes despite three powerful factors in favor of the deal. ""The bottom line, Enron needs this to happen, Dynegy wants this to happen, and ChevronTexaco is supportive of it happening,"" Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer said. Goldman Sachs downgraded Enron and Dynegy to market perform, and took both off its recommended list. Goldman said the cash infusion from Dynegy -- $1.5 billion -- ""appears inadequate to restore the confidence of Enron customers."" Enron's trading partners, now more publicly than before, on Tuesday said they were treading carefully.
""We've been scaling back for some time, but we're still dealing with Enron. Everyday, our credit people are watching,"" said Al Butkus, a vice president with Kansas City-based Utilicorp United.The trading business, Enron's crown jewel and the part most coveted by Dynegy, relies on volume for profitability, and Enron has said it was possible that the lower volumes would hamper fourth-quarter earnings. One indicator of Enron's shape was the fact that its bonds are now being quoted by price, like junk bonds, rather than by how much extra yield they carry over US treasuries, like investment-grade bonds.

The company's 6.4 per cent notes maturing in 2006 and 6.75 per cent notes maturing in 2009 were respectively bid Wednesday afternoon at 62 and 60 cents on the dollar, each down from the high-60s on Tuesday. Their yields to maturity were a respective 19 and 16 per cent. Its 20-year zero-coupon convertible bonds traded Wednesday at just over 34 cents on the dollar, down from 38 cents on Tuesday.

THE LATEST negative disclosures from Enron on Tuesday speared its stock price, which crashed to a decade low after new debt problems and an earnings revision emerged a day earlier. Shares of Enron closed down $2.07, or 22.8 per cent, at $6.99 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching $6.55 during the day -- a low not seen since May 1991. Enron was far and away the day's most active stock, with more than 62.8 million shares changing hands. Volume was more than double the second most active issue, Xerox Corp.

Meanwhile, credit rating agency Standard & Poor's said it may again cut the Houston company's BBB-minus rating, which could trigger those debt payoffs. But the agency said Enron's liquidity issues were unlikely to derail its merger with smaller cross-town rival Dynegy, announced November 9. ""This is as high a high-wire act as I have ever seen,"" analyst John Olson of investment house Sanders Morris Harris said. ""If this merger is to survive, equity investors will need to have a reason to buy the stock and their confidence will need to be restored, because the equity investor has been leading the way down."" Enron's hellish Tuesday on the market came after the company made new disclosures in a US Securities and Exchange document, filed after the market closed on Monday. Most pressing was news that Enron has until November 26 to put up $690 million in collateral against a debt to a partnership. Otherwise, the partnership could begin liquidating assets, including a Brazilian gas company which Enron plans to sell to raise $250 million. In the SEC filing, known as a Form 10-Q, Enron said it was suffering a decrease in trading volumes, particularly in longer-term deals.

TRADING VOLUME DOWN

Since the trading business -- Enron's crown jewel and the segment most coveted by Dynegy -- is low-margin, volume drives its profitability. It is too early to tell what effect the lower volumes would have on future profitability, Enron said, but analyst Andre Meade of Commerzbank Securities said Dynegy will watch the volume drop carefully. ""If it has a long-term effect, it will definitely impact the value Dynegy will put on this business,"" he said. Dynegy gave a limited response when asked if it was concerned about lower volumes, and whether it was aware of the $690 million debt before it made its deal to acquire Enron. ""We are in due diligence and Enron's 10-Q is a part of that process,"" Dynegy spokesman John Sousa said.

Meade said the filing yet again showed Enron's penchant for making disclosures bit-by-bit. Of note was its latest downward revision of its third-quarter earnings, he said. ""The restatements are coming out piecemeal as they find them, and my guess is they don't know the full extent. We think further revisions are likely,"" Meade said. One analyst who follows Enron said the SEC filing painted a darker picture of the company's cash position, given that it had $2.3 billion on hand as of Nov. 16. ""It shows that the cash drain on the company looks to be very significant,"" said the analyst, who asked not to be identified.

Standard & Poor's said Enron currently has about $1.5 billion in cash, but that follows an infusion in recent weeks of $1.5 billion from the Dynegy merger, $550 million in loans secured by pipeline assets, and $3 billion from its revolving credit lines. Another $450 pipeline-backed loan is expected in a day or two, and Enron said it expects $500 million of private equity investment plus $800 million from asset sales. Enron owes $9.15 billion by the end of next year, and its total liability for debt and other obligations is $16.86 billion, according to the SEC filing. Its merger with Dynegy is expected to close by the third quarter of 2002, raising the possibility that an Enron without investment-grade credit might not have the liquidity to survive that long.

Enron acknowledged as much in the SEC filing, stating starkly that it would be unlikely to ""to continue as a going concern,"" if a credit rating cut triggers the early payoff of $3.9 billion in debts to partnerships to which it belongs. Enron said that if its rating were cut, it would work out other payment arrangements. S&P said a similar effort being undertaken in the case of the $690 million debt will likely be successful ""given the alignment of the interests between Enron and the banks."" Enron spokesman Vance Meyer said the company had received verbal indications that the deadline on that debt was going to be extended, but it details had yet to be worked out.( REUTERS )

Unprecedented defence ties on way: Blackwill

US envoy Robert D Blackwill has said, ""conclusive acceleration"" of Indo-US defence cooperation is progressing, ""in an unprecedented way"". Mr Blackwill listed, ""joint exercises, education, intelligence, civilian nuclear safety cooperation, a joint cyber terrorism initiative, and military to military cooperation"", as areas where the two countries will be engaged in during a flurry of visits over the next 2-3 weeks. This includes chief of US Pacific command Admiral Dennis Blair and US under secretary of defence Douglas Feith. Mr Feith is the third senior-most official at the Pentagon. Mr Blackwill also made direct references to ""sale of arms"" and ""spares"", as areas which will see future cooperation. He was speaking at the Foreign Correspondents\' Club here. Even as he read out, ""an ennumerative list of strategic cooperation in the months and years ahead,"" the envoy cautioned that won't give ""a flat promise"" on such matters. ""Fundamentally, it is for both sides to earn each other's trust. Yes, the US has had an episodic and an ad hoc approach in the past, but then September 11 has changed our position on terrorism, as it has for the entire world. Is there any use in insisting on a historical approach lifted from the Cold War? But having said all this, I can't give a flat promise to any country. US policies are in the hands of our people, who in turn express themselves through their representatives"". 

Asked if unprecedented cooperation meant that Enron was no longer 'a five letter word' jarring the Indo-US commercial dialogue, Mr Blackwill cautioned, ""Enron remains a problem. We hope there will be a quick, and mutually acceptable resolution. The problem continues to pass a very dark shadow. That remains true to this day"". In a reaction, Indo-American Chamber of Commerce regional president Bimal Sareen, who was in the audience, endorsed Mr Blackwill's assessment. ""It is extremely critical for the (Indian) government to take a proactive stand on an expeditious solution...Enron is casting a cloud over foreign investment,"" Mr Sareen told The Financial Express. ""Of course, expansion of commercial relations into defence, and more security cooperation will greatly help in renewal of confidence,"" Mr Sareen added. 

On a more general note, Mr Blackwill said the regime on high tech commerce will be allowed to flow ""on the assumption of approval rather than denial"". On terrorism, the envoy showed heightened understanding of what India has repeatedly complained about. ""There are no exceptions in this war. We won't allow terrorism against the US. Nor will we allow terrorism against India. So, without (addressing concerns of) India, this war (against the Al Qaeda) won't be complete otherwise. US and India are in this battle together. And as secretary of defence Don Rumsfeld has said on Fox TV, there is no difference between terrorist networks....a terrorist is a terrorist is a terrorist. He can never be a freedom fighter. Also, no country will be allowed to provide a sanctuary to terrorists"". On Afghanistan, Mr Blackwill said, ""the US sees India as a central player in the assistance once the war is over"" He talked of the forthcoming visits of US special coordinator Richard Haas, and US envoy on Afghanistan James Dobbins to India and defended the exclusion of 'moderate Taliban' elements in the forthcoming Berlin conclave, quoting US national security advisor Condoleeza Rice. In Ms Rice's view, ""moderate and Taliban don't go together"".

Fitch thumbs down to India currency ratings (Carried only by the online edition)

International rating agency, Fitch, on Wednesday downgraded India's sovereign foreign and local currency ratings to 'BB' and 'BB+', respectively, from 'BB+' and 'BBB-' (triple B minus). However, the rating agency changed its outlook to 'stable' from 'negative' in recognition of India's continuing external strengths. Fitch said that this rating action -- presaged by a change in the outlook from 'stable' to 'negative' in May 2001 -- has been prompted by India's continued fiscal profligacy, while an unfavourable political environment is hindering economic reforms. Further, while changing its outlook to 'stable' from 'negative', Fitch cautions that \""the outlook for the local currency rating remains negative because of high and rising domestic debt and weak public finances.\"" 

The rating downgrades reflect the absence of any significant improvement in India's public finances and slow progress on disinvestment. Persistent general government deficits of over 9 per cent of GDP are the highest among 'BB' Fitch-rated sovereigns. ""The agency believes that fiscal consolidation envisioned for 2001 is unlikely to materialise due to revenue shortfalls arising from the current economic slowdown and the inability of the government to cut expenditures. More importantly, the composition of the fiscal deficit has deteriorated, with a sizable part of the revenue deficit attributable to rising public consumption. Interest payments constitute 50% of revenues and leave little room for social and capital spending,\"" said Fitch Sovereign's director, Paul Rawkins. 

Like China, India's large domestic market and the closed nature of its economy makes it less vulnerable to external shocks. Nonetheless, it is unlikely to escape unscathed from the current global economic downturn. Declining exports have already induced a dramatic slowdown in industrial production and capital spending. Lower oil prices and sluggish non-oil imports should, however, help to contain the deterioration in current account deficit, which remains manageable at around 1 per cent of GDP. India's 'BB' foreign currency rating balances this factor plus continuing improvements in its external solvency and liquidity ratios against a prospective deterioration in the foreign investment climate (and hence non-debt creating flows) consequent upon the Enron case.

Thanks Jaime,
What I don't understand is why you wouldn't do or why you are doing the following:

-	Why are you assuming that PREPA will pay you 75% of the disputed amounts in January?  What is the basis for that - - I have seen no progress from them but I could be wrong.
-	Why wouldn't you negotiate and leave READY your LNG prepayment scheme so that you're ready to pull the trigger in case something else falls through?  If you wait until the last minute (to consider), you will have NO options.


On a separate note, I understand that a potential opportunity exists to look at buying the winter cargo spot vs from Cabot.  Gas prices are dipping down rapidly and this opportunity may be gone if Eco does not evaluate it and decide a course of action very soon.  When this was presented to me I thought it certainly had a lot of merit and it was logical for us to take a look at it immediately.  Having said that, and in keeping with my philosophy that Eco needs to step in and get used to looking at this type of stuff and to making its own decisions (driven by what's best for Eco), I recommended to the Fuel manager that this be something that Eco looks at and decides on.  Where are we on that?

Thanks, Mariella

Attached please find the daily cash tracking worksheet. Please note that among all the assumptions used to build the worksheet the following are critical:

	1. That we collect the $14 million in insurance claims on or prior to July 13th. I spoke to the insurance brokers today and we expect the money by the end of next week;
	2. The Cabot July 13th payment could change to a few days earlier or later depending on how PREPA dispatches the facility after the rotor outage;
	3. We collect in January 75% of the projected PREPA outstanding amounts in dispute, in order to pay $15 million of subordinated debt.

 << File: Cash_Needs @ 06-05-01.xls >> 

Should we not receive the insurance money this month we would consider one or both of the following two proposals as a mechanism to bring cash in:

	1. The purchase of LNG by San Juan Gas;
	2. The purchase of the fuel oil inventory by Peerless.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

FIs peg reserve price of Dabhol at $700 million

The Indian financial institutions (FIs) led by the Industrial Bank of India (IDBI) have fixed the reserve price of the $3 billion Dabhol Power Company at $700 million. At a meeting in Singapore last week with the two prospective bidders _ BSES and Tata Power Company _for the controversial 2,184 MW power project, IDBI chairman P.P. Vora reportedly took a hard line and told them in no uncertain terms that they should be prepared to put in at least $700 million for the project. BSES and Tata Power have evinced interest in acquiring an 85 per cent stake in DPC (65 per cent of Enron Corporation of the US and 10 per cent each of Bechtel Enterprises and General Electric's equity). ""Technically, no bid has been called for. But for all practical purposes, the reserve price has been fixed at $700 million as the IDBI chairman made it clear to the BSES and Tata Power brass that DPC would not be sold cheaper than this,"" an institutional source said. 

Both the companies seem to have accepted the IDBI stand on the project's price as they are planning to start due diligence of the project, after signing a confidentiality agreement with DPC. The FIs have taken a proactive role in scouting for a white knight for DPC because they would end up sinking hefty sums in the venture. The total exposure (both funded and non-funded) of the Indian banks and financial institutions to DPC is about Rs 6,100 crore _ about 70 per cent of the debt component of the project built on a 70:30 debt: equity ratio. IDBI has the maximum exposure (around Rs 2,300 crore), followed by the State Bank of India (Rs 1,800 crore) and ICICI (Rs 1,700 crore). Besides, the Industrial Finance Corporation of India (IFCI) and Canara Bank also have exposure to the project. The Singapore meeting focused on completing Phase-II of the project and the sale of the shareholding oh Enron, Bechtel and General Electric to either of the prospective new buyers, BSES and Tata Power. DPC has mothballed phase I of the project (740 MW) some time back. Phase-II of the project, 90 per cent of which has been completed, includes a LNG processing facility of about 5 million tonne per annum.

Editorials - Just stick it out or be a sucker, Abracadabra / Shubhrangshu Roy 

YOU move a step forward and you are a sucker, you move a step backward and you are a sucker still. That just about sums up India's predicament in trying to get one-time US energy trading giant Enron off its back and off the 2,100 MW Dabhol power plant for some time now. For the past fortnight or so, the institutions have been bargaining hard to find a buyer for Enron's assets in Maharashtra, having committed over Rs 6,200 crore in loans. Last weekend, they even went into a huddle in Singapore to sew up the loose ends of a bail-out. Little seems to have been thrashed out so far. Little possibly will. Unless, of course, the FIs tighten the screws with a take-it or leave-it offer. The time to make that choice is now. A gentleman in pin-stripes who's done a lot of running around these past few weeks to help sew up the deal, told me the other day that Enron had indeed agreed to part with its stake in DPC at a 30 per cent discount. That would have fetched it just about $800-odd million spread over a five-year period. So, why hasn't a deal been struck? 

It's probably not worked out because of what Enron considers a fair discount on what it has sunk into the project. Prospective buyers consider this too high an asking price. For the record, Enron claims to have sunk in $1.2 billion in the project together with its partners GE and Bechtel who have supplied equipment and helped construct the plant. But my gentleman friend in pin-stripes suggests that $1.2 billion isn't exactly their equity contribution in Dabhol. That amount works out to just about $800 million. Enron, actually splurged close to $200 million on development expenses, which in gentlemen's lingo is another way of saying that the energy giant could have ended up bribing its way to see the once coveted project through besides fighting sundry court cases in India. And it wants part of that money back. Now which prospective buyer will compensate Enron for possible bribes or for making court appearances? 

Enron, it appears, has also claimed another $140 million as its share of Dabhol's retained earnings, which should eventually go to all stake-holders in DPC (the MSEB included) once the company's board passes a resolution that the amount is shared proportionately among all those who have invested in Dabhol's equity capital. Till then, leave the retained earnings aside. So, what Enron should work on is a fair discount on its equity contribution in the project, which is no more than $800 million. Now given its willingness to take a 30 per cent knock, Enron should not expect more than $560 million as the asking price for walking out of Dabhol. Add to that, if you will, another $140 million by way of retained earnings and Enron should not be getting more than $700 million at the most. Is Enron willing to take this knock? 

Given a choice, it could resist this offer. But Enron has no choice. And that's reason for cheer. Last week, Enron, close to the present American dispensation (chairman Ken Lay was the biggest fund-raiser for President George Bush's campaign effort last year) opted for a $7.8 billion rescue offer from smaller Houston rival Dynegy after narrowly escaping credit ratings cut to junk status. For the past several months Enron had been using its clout with Mr Bush to push through a bail-out package on Dabhol that suited its terms. That privilege now seems to be gone as the company grapples to stave off a Securities Exchange Commission inquiry into off-balancesheet transactions. And until Enron clears several questions back home about its finances, it will remain suspect in the eyes of US investors. 

In India, where Enron's made more news for its misses than its hits, the timing couldn't have been more opportune than now for prospective private bidders to strike a potentially lucrative deal. Two such bidders, Tata Power and BSES, are said to have offered no more than $400 million to buy out Enron's stake in DPC. It's time they stuck to that price. Or else, we could still end up being suckers. What?

'LNG Laxmi' to bring prosperity to SCI, P.Manoj 

A DIWALI gift is on the way to State-owned Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) when a consortium takes possession of a 137,000 cubic metre capacity LNG tanker from Japan's Mitsubushi yard on Thursday (November 15) after weathering a last minute financial storm. Aptly named `LNG Laxmi', after the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity, SCI's 20 per cent equity stake in the project worth $ 1 million will bring in returns in the form of time charter hire rates in proportion to its equity holding. Though, the 20 per cent stake will ensure a board presence for SCI on the joint venture Greenfield Shipping Company, it falls short of ensuring veto powers for the State-owned shipping line. This is the maiden foray by an Indian shipping company into the highly specialised and capital- intensive LNG shipping trade, marked by steady revenue streams over long periods, ranging from 10 to 25 years. Says Mr P K Srivastava, Chairman and Managing Director, SCI: ``This was a pioneering effort by an Indian shipping company into LNG shipping. 

So we were very keen that we should not fumble. We are optimistic that the experience gained from Greenfield would lead us to more such ventures in future.'' Rightly so. While LNG Laxmi was being built, SCI also secured its second LNG shipping deal, when it teamed up with Mistui, NYK Line and K Line to clinch the contract from Petronet LNG Limited (PLL) for owning and operating two tankers of 138,000 cubic metre capacity each for transporting gas from Qatar to Dahej in Gujarat. Though SCI had only 20 per cent stake in Greenfield, it managed to secure a higher holding of 34.21 per cent in the PLL deal worth Rs 130 crore. Originally, LNG Laxmi was ordered for transporting 2.5 million metric tonnes per annum of LNG from Oman to the controversial Dabhol Power Project in Maharashtra. 

Greenfield was formed for owning and operating the tanker costing $220 million. The consortium members comprise Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Lines holding 60 per cent stake, SCI and Enron-affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc with 20 per cent stake apiece. Greenfield had entered into a time charter agreement with DPC for transporting gas from Oman to its power plant in Maharashtra for a period of 20 years at a time charter hire rate of $98,600 per day. With DPC in trouble, the time charter party signed between DPC and Greenfield will be scrapped. `LNG Laxmi' went through major birth pangs before the promoters were able to take possession of the vessel. In the process, Greenfield underwent a major change in the complexion of its promoters leading to a re-alignment in the equity holding pattern.When Enron announced its intention to exit from DPC by selling its equity in view of the problems facing the power plant, the bankers to the LNG shipping deal led by ANZ Investment Bank, decided not to disburse the last tranche of the project loan of $ 55 million, declaring an event of default. This was after the 16-member lending consortium had provided $ 110 million as debt to fund the project out of a total loan commitment of $ 165 million. The three promoters were now required to invest an additional $ 55 million to bridge the gap in the project cost to take possession of the vessel or face the risk of the tanker being confiscated by the lenders to recover their investments. 

Then came the knight in shining armour in the form of the Oman Government who was generous enough to bail out LNG Laxmi from the tentacles of the lenders. The Oman Government offered to time charter LNG laxmi for 20 years at a charter hire rate of over $70,000 per day besides picking up 50 per cent equity in Greenfield, buying out the 20 per cent stake of Atlantic as well as acquiring 30 per cent from Mitsui. The financial crisis facing LNG Laxmi was thus sorted out. Oman Government would bring in $27.5 million as its contribution for holding a 50 per cent stake in Greenfield, Mitsui will invest an additional $ 16.5 million for its 30 per cent stake while SCI's extra contribution would be $11 million for its 20 per cent stake. As per current plans, the Oman Government will sub-charter `LNG Laxmi' to Oman LNG in which it holds a 51 per cent stake to ferry some of its LNG cargo to Korea and Britain, among other destinations.

DPC arbitration tribunal to meet on November 24, Sanjay Jog 

The maiden meeting of the arbitration tribunal headed by Lord Mustill, after the takeover of Enron Corp by the Dynegy Inc, will take place on November 24 in London to decide the future course of action on carrying out arbitration proceedings against the Maharashtra government initiated by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore. The arbitration tribunal comprises Maharashtra government's arbitrator Queinton Loh and the DPC's arbitrator Andrew John Rogers QC (former chief judge of the commercial division of the Supreme Court of New South Wales). The meeting deserves significance especially when the conciliatory efforts between the DPC, the Maharashtra government and the government of India which concluded on August 18 failed to reach a compromise formula as the trio stuck to their stands. The DPC referred the matter of non-payment of December bill to the arbitration tribunal led by Lord Mustill. 

Sources told The Financial Express that the November 24 meeting would decide the future timetable of arbitration proceedings to be held in London as per the power purchase agreement and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The dispute related to the non-payment of December bill would be taken up during these proceedings. The DPC, which has been restrained by the Supreme Court from proceeding against the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for carrying out arbitration process until the issue of jurisdiction of Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission is resolved, in its arbitration notice served on April 12 had said that the board had disputed the payment of December 2000 bill. The MSEB, which was served a total bill of Rs 159.86 crore on January 5, 2001 failed to pay the full the sum on the due date, January 25.

`Enron buyout will not affect Dabhol project'

The buyout of Enron Corp by its rival, Dynegy Inc, would have no bearing on the future of the Dabhol Power project for the moment. It is learnt that talks on selling out Enron's investment in DPC, amounting to over $ 1 billion, would continue as before. A DPC spokesman said, ""It is too early to comment on how this will impact us."" On the question of selling Enron's stake in DPC, he said, ""While discussions are happening, it will be inappropriate to comment."" According to the agreement worked out last week with Dynegy, Enron Corp would sell its share for $9.5 million. Pointing out that the deal with Dynegy would materialise only in the third quarter of 2002, an official with a Indian financial institution aid, ""It is important to realise that this is not a deal based on balance sheets but a stock-swap."" 

The deal was announced even as Indian and foreign lenders to the DPC were meeting in Singapore with DPC office-bearers to negotiate with bidders. The prominent companies interested in buying out DPC at this stage are Tata Power and Bombay Suburban Electric Supply (BSES). A senior official with a financial institution said that though assets like DPC could be transferred to Dynegy at a later stage, these aspects would emerge only later in the talks to consolidate the takeover. Financial institutions though are concerned about the fallout of the deal on the offers received for Enron's stake in DPC. Also, the legal status of such a sale, if it does take place, would have to be scrutinised carefully, says a senior official of a company which has lent funds to DPC. In Singapore, Indian FIs led by IDBI and including ICICI and State Bank of India met DPC executives over two days from November 8 and discussed the pricing of the stake of the three multinational partners in DPC - Enron, Bechtel and General Electric - with the prospective sponsors, Tata Power and BSES. Incentives promised by the Centre to expedite resolution of the decade-old controversy and the possibility of an affordable tariff also came up for discussion.

DPC meet suggests lenders taking cut, MAT exemption, Sanjay Jog 

A reduction in per unit tariff at Rs 2.70, equity holders and lenders to take hits and cuts, a cut in interest rate, exemption from payment of minimum alternate tax, providing mega power status for the Dabhol project and, above all, separation of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility from the power project are some of the highlights of the package considered by the Indian Financial Institutions (IFIs) along with Dabhol Power Company (DPC), Tata Power and BSES at the recently concluded three-day meet in Singapore. 

IFI sources involved in the Singapore meeting told The Financial Express that the participants have made it clear that the implementation of the package would not be possible unless the present equity holders and lenders are prepare to take hits and cuts and the Government of India, Government of Maharashtra and Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) provide substantial incentives and concessions. The emphasis has been laid on a substantial reduction in tariff and an early completion of Dabhol phase-II - the construction of which has been suspended since June 17. ""The project will continue to languish if there is no possibility of providing power at an affordable tariff by adding value to the equity,"" sources added. 

According to sources, both equity holders and lenders would stand to loose enormously as both would have to take hits and cuts. ""The existing equity promoter would have to be prepared to take a substantial cut in the equity value without which the tariff would not come down to a reasonable level,"" sources said. They have stressed the need for a payment security mechanism for the sale of power. ""The Government of Maharashtra will have to take a policy decision to allot suitable distribution circles of above 1,500 mw capacity load without which the project will remain unviable,"" sources said. The IFIs and utilities have demanded that the Centre would have to provide exemption from the payment of minimum alternate tax (MAT). ""Such an incentive is needed as tax is passed on to the consumers. The exemption in MAT will ultimately help in the reduction of tariff,"" sources said. The package also envisages substantial reduction in interest rates by lenders, conversion of foreign debt into rupee debt so that the price of power would not get affected following foreign exchange fluctuations. The IFIs, DPC, Tata Power and BSES have also suggested a suitable moratorium period of 15 years or more. They have unanimously called for providing a mega power status to the Dabhol project in a bid to get concessions in the customs duty. 

According to sources, the existing promoters would have to facilitate finalisation of a new fuel supply agreement which would result in the fall in cost of supply. Further, the LNG facilities would have to be restructured to help reduce the capital cost substantially. According to the power purchase agreement between DPC and MSEB, the re-gassification facility is for 5 million metric tonne per day (MMTPA) of LNG, whereas the power plant has contracted for only 2.1 MMTPA of LNG (of which 1.8 million tonne is take or pay), and even using that requires an unreasonably high plant load factor. According to Madhav Godbole renegotiation committee, after segregating the LNG facility, it could be marketed to other buyers of gas, separate from the power project. Sources said various government departments and lenders would have to consider this package as appropriate decisions would have to be taken at different levels. Moreover, cabinet decisions as well as approvals from the board of directors of IDBI, ICICI and other lenders would also be required for the implementation of the package.

Andersen's underbelly gets exposed, Sunil Jain 

The Enron disclosures raise questions about top-notch audit firms. After all the curious financial dealings of various Enron Corp officials, comes the admission that the firm had overstated its profits by around a fifth for the past four years. The disclosure comes in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing on the eve of the Enron-Dynegy takeover talks. For those Indians who've been agitating against Dabhol Power Company plant in Maharashtra, all this is, of course, just another 'example' of the power company's perfidy. If Enron could do this in the US, imagine the kind of fiddles it must have done in the case of the Dabhol plant. 

This, may or may not be true, and certainly needs to be proved. But the firm whose reputation has taken an equal, if not bigger beating, is the audit firm Arthur Andersen, a reputed global player. What was, a lawsuit filed last week in Oregon asks, Arthur Andersen doing when all this happened? How could Andersen not find anything fishy with Enron's financial deals? And, though the law suit doesn't deal with this, how did Andersen allow such a massive over-stating of profits? While only a probe will reveal how things managed to go so wrong, it's a good idea to go back and read a book called The Big Six by Mark Stevens, incidentally also the author of The Big Eight, which is the number of the top global audit firms before they consolidated and reduced their number to six. Stevens' most evocative story is the one about ZZZZ Best, the carpet-cleaning business begun by Barry J Minkow. Barry built his company into a formidable enterprise with a turnover of $ five mn, and then decided to go public, and while doing so, boasted that his firm was in the lucrative insurance-restoration business - that is, he got restoration contracts from insurance firms. Minkow then hired top accounting firm Ernst & Whinney (that later merged with Arthur Young to become Ernst & Young) to help boost his image. 

Ernst decided to do an audit of Minkow's insurance business. Minkow hired someone's office in Sacramento, bribed the security guard to pretend he was familiar with ZZZZ's staff and forced Ernst to do an inspection on a Sunday, when other offices were closed. Ernst gave a glowing report of the business. The same pattern of 'inspections' was then repeated in other cities. When the scandal became public, Ernst pleaded they couldn't be blamed for not being able to detect such an elaborate fraud, and they certainly didn't have the skills of the police. The police, who, for instance, just spent around ten minutes in each city going to the building department to find out if the buildings that ZZZZ was helping 'restore' had ever had a fire or water leakages ZZZZ claimed they'd had. 

Fair enough, but the House Committee on Oversight asked what about the 'confidentiality letter' that Ernst had signed? A confidentiality letter that said Ernst would never disclose the location of the buildings ZZZZ was restoring to any third party - that's fine. It also said it would 'not make any follow-up telephone calls to any contractors, insurance companies, the building owner ... involved in the restoration project.' Congressman Ron Wyden asked Ernst how it proposed to do an independent audit with such restrictions? Ernst said 'It did not restrict me being able to perform that and I did go on site ... if I would have had any questions that came up in the course of that review, I would have pursued those questions ...' Of course, questions didn't come up because Ernst wasn't looking too hard. 

It gets better. An informant told Ernst the 'restoration' job it had inspected in Sacramento was a fake. Later, the charge was withdrawn, but none of this made Ernst want to revisit the Sacramento site. Later, Ernst walked out on ZZZZ after some bad press about false credit card billings by ZZZZ, and the account was taken over by Price Waterhouse. This despite Ernst telling Price Waterhouse that it had found evidence of payments by ZZZZ to the individual who made and then withdrew the complaint about the restoration jobs being fake! Incidentally, the discovery didn't prompt Ernst into reporting the matter to the authorities either. 

In other cases, like the widely-reported Savings & Loan scandals in several states, it was the Big Six - such as Touche Ross in the S&L case - who allowed firms to get away with major fiddles such as changing descriptions of loans, and ignoring warnings by even the internal auditors. In one Congressional hearing, for instance, the Touche partner was talking of a particular deal which had both an equity and a loan component. What was the amount of the equity, the Congressman asked. I don't know, replied the Touche partner? And they were the auditors. The Enron-Andersen episode shows much remains the same. It'll be interesting to see what action the SEC takes against both Enron and Andersen in this case. The veneer of professionalism of the Big Six audit firms, needless to say, has been badly damaged.

Bidders demand distribution rights, Rajesh Unnikrishnan 

The two bidders for the 85 per cent stake in Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company - Tata Power and BSES Ltd have demanded the distribution rights for the 1,500 mw power from Dabhol in the Maharashtra state as one of the pre-condition for buying out the stake. The bidders' demand will be one of the main points in the new proposal being prepared by the Indian financial Institutions led by the Industrial Development Bank of India for the Maharashtra state government and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board. This was one of the main issues which had been discussed between the Indian FIs, Tatas and BSES during their recently concluded meeting in Singapore. 

Sources close to the development said that both Tatas and BSES have asked a 1,500 mw power distribution zone preferably Nagpur Distribution Zone or Navi Mumbai Distribution Zone to formulate a workable model for DPC project once the equity acquisition gets over. FIs sources said that there have been some preliminary talks in this direction. "" We believe that a workable model would emerge in order to facilitate the take-over,"" they said. However, the sources refused to divulge more on the issue. However, a senior executive engineer of MSEB said that the Board is totally out of the picture now. There is no official communication from the FIs as far as the allocation of distribution zones are concerned. Once a proposal comes in, MSEB will consider it. Industry sources pointed out that allocating new distribution zones will not be a viable idea for MSEB as the financial health of the board has been deteriorating for the last couple of years. Navi Mumbai Distribution Zone and Nagapur Distribution Zone are considered as the cash- rich distribution zones and giving away any of these zones would further affect the financial health of board.

MSEB asks Dabhol Power to defer Houston meet in wake of HC order, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has dashed off a letter asking the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to postpone the November 19 board meeting slated to take place in Houston, in view of the Bombay High Court restraining DPC from issuing a final termination notice. The DPC board among others proposes to authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline to issue the final termination notice to the MSEB. MSEB, which has heaved a sigh of relief following the Bombay High Court order on a civil suit filed by the Indian financial institutions (FIs), have made it clear that the meeting needed to be postponed as the state principal energy secretary VM Lal, who is on the DPC board, had been to London to brief the government solicitors DLA in connection with the ex-parte order passed by the London court restraining the state government from filing any civil suit against DPC in India. MSEB has said that Mr Lal would need some time as he was busy with the London court matter. 

MSEB sources told The Financial Express that it has told the DPC that there was no point rushing for November 19, as the high court has already prohibited the DPC from issuing a final termination notice ""until further orders."" Sources added that the high court has slated next hearing on December 3. However, DPC has verbally communicated to the MSEB that as of now the meeting was on. According to DPC, the final termination notice would not be served at the November 19 meeting but it would simply authorise the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for issuing such a notice to MSEB, the sources said. DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal said ""we are unable to confirm or deny. Mr Cline, who had recently attended the three-day Singapore meet convened by the Indian financial institutions, has yet to land in Mumbai as he is still camping in Singapore. Mr Cline, who would later go to Houston, New York and Washington in the wake of Dynegy Inc's decision to acquire Enron Corp, is likely to return to Mumbai around December 3. 

The November 19 meeting, which coincides with the expiry of six months since the issuance of a preliminary termination notice by DPC to MSEB on May 19, would also take up issues related to the question of financial position of DPC relating to the phase-I (740 mw) which has been lying idle since MSEB's decision to suspend power purchase from May 29. The meeting would also take up matters related to the debt servicing for phase-II (1,444 mw). The construction work has already brough to a halt following the termination of construction contract by the construction contractors from June 17. The DPC has already defaulted the interest/guarantee fee of Rs 57 crore, which was due in September/October this year to rupee lenders/guarantors. 

Maharashtra govt denies permission to attend meet 
The Maharashtra government has denied its consent to MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal, the state principal energy secretary VM Lal and MSEB technical director Prem Paunikar for attending the November 19 meeting at Houston. It is likely that none of the directors representing MSEB and the state government would be present for the said meeting. MSEB holds 30 per cent equity in the Dabhol Phase-I while it has not picked up similar equity in the Phase-II in view of its precarious finances.

MSEB 'will not' attend DPC meet in Houston 

Maharashtra State Electricity Board has once again decided not to attend the board meeting of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company, scheduled to be held in Houston on November 19. ""We reserve our right to be present in the board meeting being held in Houston,"" MSEB sources said on Friday. This is the third time that MSEB has refused to attend the board meetings, which were earlier held in Mumbai. It also did not attend the annual general meeting of the energy major held a couple of months ago in the city. ""DPC has consistently ignored our rebate claim for their material misrepresentation in the operating capabilities of the plant. Since there is nothing that we can discuss we see no point in attending such meetings,"" sources added. 

A DPC spokesman, when contacted, declined to comment stating that ""it is a statutory internal matter."" MSEB also refused to take cognisance of the November 5 asset transfer notice and several monthly bills despatched by DPC stating that it had rescinded the power purchase agreement. The first preliminary termination notice expires on November 19, the same day as the board meeting. However, the Mumbai high court has restrained DPC from issuing the final termination notice till December 3. DPC has also sought lenders' approval for issuance of the final termination notice but Indian lenders are yet to give their consent. (PTI)

Parleys on Enron stake sale continue; BSES, Tata Power begin due diligence

WHILE more skeletons are tumbling out from Enron's cupboards in Houston, hectic negotiations are currently on between Indian financial institutions and power firms BSES and Tata Power for the sale of Enron's Dabhol power project. Mumbai-based power companies BSES Ltd and Tata Power have kicked off the process of carrying out due diligence - to find out the true value of the project and economics of the takeover - of the troubled $2.9 billion Dabhol Power Company (DPC). Facing a default on its Rs 6,190 crore loan to DPC, Indian financial institutions are pushing the takeover plan seriously with Enron and bidders. They are also looking out for other buyers besides DPC and BSES. 

BSES has already announced its decision to appoint internal and external task forces for carrying out due diligence of the project after signing a confidentiality agreement with DPC. Tata Power is also negotiating to work out the modalities for signing a confidentiality agreement for carrying out due diligence. ""Indian institutions are insisting for a minimum reserve price of $700 million (around Rs 3,360 crore) for the Enron stake. Now the ball is in the courts of BSES and Tata,"" said an institutional source. However, both BSES and the Tatas are not in favour of paying more than $400 million for the project due to huge liability including to the Indian Customs. 

BSES chairman and managing director RV Shahi had already gone on record saying that the company has shown its interest to acquire 85 per cent stake (65 per cent of Enron and 20 per cent of GE and Bechtel) in the Dabhol project at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by the Indian financial institutions (IFIs). The rest of the equity would be held by MSEB which is the only buyer of power from Dabhol Power. Shahi said until the completion of due diligence, BSES expects concrete formulations of various types of incentives/concessions which should be available from the Government of India, Government of Maharashtra and lenders. ""Outcome of due diligence with concrete proposals of incentives/concessions will enable BSES to assess the valuation for the Dabhol project. It is not a workable proposal for the company to accept without due diligence,"" he added. Bidders are keen that all the steps should be required to significantly reduce the generation tariff. ""Unless that happens it will be difficult to positively look at the opportunity,"" said an official. 

But it's still not clear whether Dynegy will support the exit plan. ""Though the takeover has been announced, the process will be completed only by the third quarter of next year,"" Enron circles said. Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) which holds 15 per cent stake in DPC is trying hard to prevent any exit before the stake sale. It is learnt that the two bidders are keen for a reduction in per unit tariff at Rs 2.70, a cut in interest rate, exemption from payment of minimum alternate tax, providing mega power status for the Dabhol project and separation of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility from the power project. These issues were considered at the recent Singapore Singapore meet. ""The project will continue to languish if there is no possibility of providing power at an affordable tariff by adding value to the equity,"" FI sources add. 

According to sources, both equity holders and lenders would stand to loose enormously as both would have to take hits and cuts. ""The existing equity promoter would have to be prepared to take a substantial cut in the equity value without which the tariff would not come down to a reasonable level,"" sources said. They have stressed the need for a payment security mechanism for the sale of power. ""The Government of Maharashtra will have to take a policy decision to allot suitable distribution circles of above 1,500 mw capacity load without which the project will remain unviable,"" sources said. The FIs and utilities have demanded that the Centre would have to provide exemption from the payment of minimum alternate tax. ""Such an incentive is needed as tax is passed on to the consumers. The exemption in MAT will ultimately help in the reduction of tariff,"" sources said. 

The package also envisages substantial reduction in the interest rates by lenders, conversion of foreign debt into rupee debt so that the price of power would not get affected following foreign exchange fluctuations. The IFIs, DPC, Tata Power and BSES have also suggested a need for a suitable moratorium period of 15 years or more. They have unanimously called for providing a mega power status to the Dabhol project in a bid to get concessions in the customs duty. MSEB, which has heaved a sigh of relief following the Mumbai high court order on a civil suit filed by the Indian financial institutions, have made it clear that the meeting needed to be postponed as the state principal energy secretary VM Lal, who is on the DPC board, had been to London to brief the government solicitors DLA in connection with the ex-parte order passed by the London court restraining the state government from filing any civil suit against DPC in India.

It is deal-making time in Dabhol, D. Sampathkumar

THE Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company continues to navigate choppy waters, in its quest for the safe harbour of unhindered domestic operations. If the uncertainty over cancellation by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) of its power purchase agreement with the company is not enough, there comes the news that MSEB, a 15 per cent stakeholder in the company, refuses to participate in the deliberations of the company's Board. Its tactical compulsions in this regard are entirely understandable. It does not want to be even remotely seen as party to decisions of the company that could compromise its claims against the company at a later date. But the continuing standoff between the MSEB and the overseas promoters notwithstanding, a unique combination of circumstances has provided the right conditions for an amicable resolution of the messy tangle that the project is enmeshed in, at the moment. Each of the parties with a stake in the project has its own compulsions in seeking a resolution of the dispute and thereby put an end to the uncertainties facing them vis-a-vis their financial exposure to the project. For all the bravado, the basic fact remains that none of the parties involved in the deal can afford to dig in its heels and refuse to go along. Leading the list is Enron, the project's principal promoter. Its claims to being the injured party in the game of political football that the project has become, has lost some of its strength in the wake of troubles confronting it at home. Its non- energy business is largely in tatters and controversies over accounting policies and disclosures of performance, are developments it could have done without in its quest for an image of purity of a fresh driven snow. 

Adding a new dimension to the issue is the news of takeover of Enron by Dynegy Inc., a much smaller rival in the industry but without any of the excess baggage of questionable investments of the former. This is a positive development. Dynegy would have its hands full managing the merged business with all its inherent complexities. The position domestic financial institutions find themselves in, in this imbroglio, is even more untenable than that of the overseas promoter. Servicing of debt would be the first casualty in any termination of the commercial contract between the Maharashtra Electricity Board and Dabhol Power Company. With their balance sheets in a precarious position the implications for provisioning for non-performing assets that a default occasions are horrendous. As for the Central Government, its position as merely the counter guarantor of MSEB's payment obligations under the power purchase agreement does not offer it much room for comfort. Also, while in theory, the Centre can pay and recover it out of the finances devolving on Maharashtra from the Centre, in practice, this may prove to be politically infeasible. As it is, some of the more prosperous states in the federal set-up feel they are contributing far more to the cause of balanced regional development than they can reasonably be credited with. The extraction, by way of counter-guarantee obligations, is certain to stoke fissiparous regional sentiments besides handing out a stiff price to the party in power at the Centre when it is election time in that region. 

What, then, could be the contours of a possible deal among the interested parties? If the deal is to be sold by each party to its constituents, it must be seen as a fair one and yet recognise the harsh commercial realities that characterise the present situation of each of the parties to the dispute. The project with its integrated structure of power generation, port handling and regasification can no longer be sustained if domestic bidders are to be roped in as new promoters. For then, the financial outlay implicit in a project of such a composite nature is beyond the capability of most domestic players in the power utility business. It hence needs to be rebundled into two components - namely, the generation assets and support infrastructure such as gas terminal and regasification plant. 

Second, differential treatment in the valuation of assets in the two phases of the projects is a must. Enron, after all, is in possession of a counter-guarantee for the investment made in the first phase of the project. Hence, the broad principle of international market price for assets taken over will have to be tempered by the recognition that insofar as the first phase is concerned, the valuation is not so much for pieces of generating equipment as for a stream of guaranteed cash flows from a commercial contract. The political education expenses that Enron has admittedly incurred cannot completely be ignored as some Indian entities appear to have been the beneficiaries. Sensitivity to these aspects provides a possible framework for resolving the dispute.

'DPC sale to be decided by Enron, Tatas, BSES' 

THE INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India on Monday said the selling price of the erstwhile US energy major Enron's troubled Dabhol Power Company will be decided by the two city-based utilities Tata Power and BSES with the multinational through `mutual negotiations'. ""It is expected that further steps in this regard will be initiated by DPC, BSES and Tata Power in the next few days to begin the due diligence, after signing a confidentiality agreement with DPC,"" IDBI chairman and managing director P P Vora said in a statement here. He said Indian financial institutions including IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India and IFCI, who have an exposure of over Rs 6,000 crore in DPC, along with the Centre, MSEB and Maharashtra government, could consider certain incentives to prospective new sponsors with a view to making the project more attractive and bring down the tariff to a reasonable level. ""Brief features of an incentive package prepared by a committee appointed by the Centre were also discussed,"" Vora said.

DPC officials also clarified various technical and operational issues, which will need to be resolved for smooth management transfer and successful operation of the plant by the new sponsors, it said. The three day Singapore meeting of the FIs with DPC and the private utilities also included officials from National Thermal Power Corporation and Central Electricity Authority to to provide technical advice, the Chairman informed. The issues discussed included completion of the 1,444 mw phase-II of the project and the cost thereof, sale of Enron, Becthtel and GE's shareholding in DPC (aggregating 85 per cent of total capital) to either of the prospective new sponsors like BSES and Tata Power.""Based on these discussions and clarifications provided by IFIs and DPC, both BSES and Tata Power have expressed deep interest to purchase the 85 per cent shareholding of DPC subject to certain conditions, inter-alia, on price of shares and other related technical and operational issues,"" Vora said.

After their return from the three-day Singapore meet, a senior FI official had confirmed that ""the road map was now clear. Tata Power and BSES will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and other assets and most importantly the legal wrangles and then make a final bid for the distressed company"". Interestingly, the erstwhile energy major had informed the FIs a few days ago that it was ready to take a 30 per cent hit on its equity at around $850 million from the initial offer price of $1.2 billion. However, both Tata Power and BSES have demanded a 50 per cent reduction in Enron's offer. (PTI)

Tatas, BSES keen to acquire DPC 

Indian power generation companies Tata Power Company Ltd and BSES Ltd have expressed interest in acquiring the 85 percent stake held by Enron and its associates in the controversial Dabhol Power Company. ""Both BSES and Tata Power have expressed deep interest to purchase the 85 percent shareholding held by Enron and its associates. They would also like to conduct due diligence of the project,"" said a statement Tuesday by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), the lead lender to the project. The statement also said lenders and owners of Dabhol held a three-day meeting last week in Singapore that was ""fruitful and expected to pave the way towards the solution for the various issues."" US-based Enron has said expects about $1 billion for the stake. Enron, along with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and the state government, had jointly set up the power plant in the western state, which stopped generating electricity after MSEB failed to pay for power from the 1,284 megawatt project. DPC has served an ""asset transfer notice"" to the MSEB for the valuation of the company's assets in order to sell them off. IDBI and other lenders such as the State Bank of India, ICICI and IFCI have lent more than Rs 6000 crore to the project and filed a lawsuit against DPC to ensure they get their funds back. ( AFP )

Govt not to encash gurantees against DPC 

IN AN ad-interim order, Mumbai High Court has restrained the Centre and customs authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by State Bank of India in regard to customs duty payable by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporation for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in its Dabhol plant. The ex-parte injunction was granted by justice D G Karnik on November 15 on a petition filed by DPC challenging the show cause notice issued by customs authorities asking the company to pay Rs 245 crore as import duty on the equipment. The court also restrained the SBI to make payment under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of DPC. The judge, however, allowed DPC to file an appeal before customs, excise and gold appellate tribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order (November 15). He also ruled that the ex-parte injunction order shall automatically stand vacated from December 15 subject to the orders that may be passed by the tribunal.

Meanwhile, the court directed DPC and respondents to keep the bank guarantee alive and enforceable. It also ordered that notices be issued to the respondents after four weeks. On a show cause notice issued by the customs department, the adjudicating officer had ruled that the power producer had wrongly availed of the customs duty concession to import equipment needed for LPG project. According to him, the concession was available only for the power plant and not for the LPG facility. He had also imposed a penalty of Rs 45 crore taking the total liability of DPC to Rs 290 crore. DPC, on the other hand, contended that LPG facility was essential to the power project and was thus eligible for concession in customs duty.( PTI )

FIs for allotting distribution zone to DPC buyer, Anto T Joseph

IDBI-LED financial institutions are putting together a proposal to be presented to the state government and Maharashtra State Electricity Board, under which the buyer of Enron's Dabhol Power Company would be allotted a distribution zone. The new owner would also be allowed to sell electricity directly to consumers, if the proposal is accepted. This proposal formed the basis of discussions during the recent three-day Singapore meet between IFIs, DPC and the two utilities in the fray for buying Enron out of DPC, Tata Power and BSES. If the proposal doesn't find favour with MSEB and the government, it will be a setback for domestic lenders, who would be forced to piece together another workable model.

FI sources said offering a profitable distribution zone and allowing third-party sale of electricity was a pre-condition set by both the contenders. Primarily electricity distribution utilities, both Tata Power and BSES will also evaluate one of the lucrative distribution zones of Navi Mumbai, Thane or Pune as part of the package deal. ET had on October 6 reported that the domestic lenders had mooted a similar proposal, with the help of the Central Electricity Authority. Maharashtra State Electricity Board had then rejected the proposal to part with any part of its distribution network to any private power utility. Since then, things have moved fast and mostly in favour of the domestic lenders with the Union government and the power ministry supporting the proposal. ""This is a payment security mechanism, thrown up by Indian lenders. If MSEB buys the power from phase I (744 mega-watt), there needs to be a buyer for the rest of 1440 MW produced by the second phase.

This could be a combination of two - handing-over of a MSEB-owned distribution circle and selling power directly to a few industries,"" said a BSES official. Another option of NTPC buying power from the plant was also discussed at the Singapore meet. MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal told ET that no such proposal has ever come to the board from domestic lenders. ""Tata Power has been demanding an extension of their distribution areas. But we can't afford to oblige because that would imbalance our receivables,"" said Bansal. As the FI officials pointed out, the proposal involves all involved parties making sacrifices to salvage the project. While the sacrifice would be in the form of lower interest rates for lenders and selling its stake for an amount below its initial investment by Enron, MSEB would have to sacrifice a distribution zone.

MSEB, however, says that once a lucrative zone is chopped off from its distribution area, it will lead to MSEB's cashflows declining drastically. ""These economics are preventing us from giving away any distribution areas,"" said a MSEB official. Over the last two years, Maharashtra State Electricity Board had tried to unbundle its functions and privatise distribution circles by appointing IL&FS and the Administrative Staff College of India of Hyderabad. Both IL&FS's proposal to form a joint venture to privatise Navi Mumbai, and ASCI's Maharashtra Electricity Reform Bill are currently on the backburner.

DPC sponsors meet next week for due diligence talks 
Senior officials of energy major Enron Corp, Bechtel and GE, the three foreign sponsors of the troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC), will meet in Houston next week to take a decision on whether to proceed with the proposal of due diligence to be carried out by city-based power utilities, the Tata Power Company and BSES Ltd. ""The offshore sponsors of DPC have not yet given their go-ahead for potential buyers of their 85 per cent equity to commence due diligence. They are scheduled to meet before this month end to decide their next step regarding Dabhol project,"" sources close to the sponsors said here on Tuesday. When contacted, DPC spokesperson declined to confirm or deny the development. Sources said that the sponsors' decision would be conveyed to the Industrial Development Bank of India-led consortium of Indian lenders by first week of December. ""Contradictory to recent announcements by Indian lenders, and the prospective buyers, the ability of any party to sign the confidentiality agreement and proceed with due diligence will after all depend on the three foreign sponsors' approval,"" they pointed out.
Both Tatas and BSES would need their approval and co-operation to commence due diligence, sources emphasised. Tata Power managing director Adi Engineer confirmed that they were yet to commence DPC due diligence. ""We are waiting to sign the confidentiality agreement with DPC sponsors after which Tata Power would take at least a few months to complete the process,"" Engineer said. Sources termed the meet as critical in deciding the future course of events in resolving the issues surrounding the $3 billion power project. ""Enron, GE and Bechtel had raised the issue of continuing costs of fundings during the three-day marathon Singapore meet, risen as a result of the Indian and foreign lenders' refusal to disburse additional funds,"" they informed.
The proposed due-diligence was expected to take another two-three months, sources said, adding the situation had become more fragile with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board not drawing power since May 29 and lenders stopping disbursements to the 2,814 mw project March onwards. ""This has resulted in the beleagured DPC also being unable to meet its loan repayment commitments in September and October,"" they added. During the Singapore meet, the three foreign sponsors had also expressed their grave concern about bearing additional expenses as the due diligence process would take its own time and incur significant costs, only adding to deterioration of assets and their cost burden, the sources said. On Monday, BSES Ltd chairman and managing director R.V. Shahi had announced that the company was likely to complete the due diligence of the Dabhol project by January end next year. Shahi said that BSES had returned the draft of confidentiality agreement with comments to DPC. BSES would appoint three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence along with an internal task force to do parallel ground work, he said.( PTI )

BSES inches forward in DPC race 

BSES has inched a step forward in the race to acquire Enron's stake in Dabhol Power Company. The company, which is one of the bidders for Enron's stake has approached the heads of financial institutions for funding of the project after the change in ownership. Irrespective of who the new stake-holder is, they would need the Fis to lend to them to see the completion of the project. The heads of institutions are at present considering the BSES request though a view is yet to be taken on the issue. BSES apart, Tata Power is the other serious contender for the project.

The Fis have been sounding out the both BSES and Tata Power as the government feels that buying out the plant could be good proposition if some of the tariff issues are sorted out. R V Shahi, chairman-cum-managing director of BSES said after his meeting Singapore last week that talks were progressing and the company would soon get on with the next stage. BSES, is likely to complete due diligence of the 2,184 MW Dabhol Power project by January end next year. ""The due diligence process will take 6-8 weeks after signing of the confidentiality agreement with Enron promoted DPC,"" BSES CMD R V Shahi told reporters here. Shahi said BSES has returned the draft of confidentiality agreement with comments to DPC. The confidentiality agreement, a pre-requisite for beginning due diligence of DPC to assess the value of its assets, investments needed to complete the 1,444 MW Phase-II and its liabilities, would in all probability be signed by the end of this month.BSES would appoint three separate consultants for doing technical, financial and legal due diligence of the 2.9 billion dollar project, he said, adding that simultaneously an internal task force would also be appointed to do parallel ground work. Shahi said the company has shown interest in acquiring 85 per cent stake of Enron, Bechtel and GE in the Dabhol project at the recently concluded Singapore meeting convened by FIs. After signing the confidentiality agreement BSES will formally look into the financial books of DPC, its loans, sponsors and other assets and legal wrangles before taking any decision on the acquisition price.

Enron in talks to sell off data centre, Arun Kumar 

Beleaguered energy major Enron is said to be in negotiations with at least two prospective Indian buyers for selling its $18 million Internet Data Centre (IDC) located at Mumbai. This is the second Indian investment that Enron is looking to exit from. It is already in the midst of a possible selloff of its stake in the controversial Dabhol Power Co. When contacted, an Enron India spokesperson said ""as part of our policy we do not discuss this issue with the media. As you are aware such issues are part of our global strategy, but we are not desperate to sell"". 

However sources maintained that the company was talking to at least two bidders, one being a leading Mumbai real estate firm, and that talks were currently hedged on pricing issues. The reason for the selloff move is part of Enron's decision to exit from India, the sources added. The move is also being fuelled by the recent $9.5 billion acquisition of Enron by Dynegy Inc. According to the sources, Enron may sell IDC at below cost. It had invested over $18 million (over Rs 90 crore) to develop the 30,000 sq. ft. data center, which caters to a host of new economy firms, including Hungama.com and Gateway System. The sources added Enron had considered roping in a strategic equity partner for IDC and, since that did not happen, ""it has now decided to exit from this business"". 

Enron India had announced grand plans for setting up a nationwide fiber optic cable backbone to tap rising demand for bandwidth. After the company abandoned this plan, speculation was rife that it would divest its data center sooner or later. Analysts said the center is a standalone business globally and Enron was left with no option but to take bandwidth on lease from others. This increased the project cost, they observed. The company had originally planned to set up five more data centers in Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad.

Enron restates Q3 earnings 

S embattled Enron examines its books, the energy trader restated its third-quarter earnings, increasing its loss for the period by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. The company also disclosed it is trying to restructure a $690-million obligation that could come due November 27. Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said the company has the cash on hand to pay the obligation but would like to have it restructured and extended. ""We are working with the lenders to restructure or extend the term on the obligation,"" he said. Palmer said the obligation could come due because of Enron's lowered credit rating. When the rating was reduced, it triggered a clause in one of the ""limited partnership agreements that could cause that $690 million obligation to become due beginning next week."" 

Houston-based Enron, which is being purchased by rival Dynegy to escape a recent spate of problems and shattered Wall Street confidence, also increased nine-month earnings by a cent to 20 cents a share. Dynegy is purchasing the company for $7.8 billion in stock. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, Enron explained that auditor Arthur Andersen LLP hasn't finalised its review of the company's financial statements because of an ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors. ""We are continuing to review the transactions in question and are making progress with our investigation,"" said William K Powers Jr., chairman of the special committee and dean of the University of Texas School of Law. The merger is expected to go through by next summer. Dynegy, backed by major investor ChevronTexaco, will also assume $13 billion of Enron debt. Enron agreed to be bought after its stock price plunged about 80 per cent in the weeks after it disclosed a third quarter loss followed by an acknowledgment that the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating partnerships run by company officials.

Maharashtra govt objects MSEB's 19% tariff hike, Sanjay Jog 

Bowing to the pressure from an influential powerloom and agricultural lobby along with various consumer organisations, the state government has strongly opposed the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) 19 per cent tariff hike suggested for 2001-02 to the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (Merc). The state government, in its affidavit before the Merc has made it clear that the tariff hike proposed by the state electricity board was on \""higher side in respect of domestic, agricultural, powerloom and public works consumers.""

According to the government affidavit, the tariff hike for the domestic consumer for the slab of 0-30 units would comprise Rs 20 as fixed charge per month and 75 paise per unit as energy charge instead of MSEB's proposal of Rs 75 per month fixed charge. For non-domestic consumers, the government has proposed a fixed charge of Rs 100 per month and energy charge of Rs 2.50 per unit for 0-100 units. Although the government has proposed a fixed charge of Rs 100 per month for 101-200 units and 201-above units like the MSEB, it has suggested an energy charge of Rs 4.60 and Rs 6 as energy charge for 101-200 units and 201-above units respectively. For powerlooms, the fixed charge would be Rs 75 per horse power per month instead of MSEB's proposal of Rs 100 per kw per month. However, it has suggested different energy charges against MSEB's proposal of a similar energy charge of Rs 2 per unit. For agricultural consumers, the flat rate tariff would be Rs 100 per horse power per month instead of MSEB's proposal of Rs 300 per KW per month for load between 0-5 horse power. The state government has admitted that there was a difference of opinion between it and the state electricity board with regard to the proposed tariff increase.

""As such, it is necessary that MSEB and state government come to an agreement in this regard for which the Commission may take appropriate steps,"" the government said. ""The government of Maharashtra has taken note of apprehensions expressed by public representatives and has come to the conclusion that the proposed tariff in respect of certain categories of consumers, as mentioned above, is indeed on the higher side.""

A survival kit for Tata Power, BSES, S Ravindran Mumbai 

The two domestic power biggies_Tata Power and BSES_are vying for Enron's 65 per cent stake in the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) in what seems like a critical battle for survival for both. Tata Power, it appears, has two primary reasons to bid for Dabhol Power: one, it gets a ready built plant when all its other projects are on paper; two, it also pre-empts arch rival BSES. This is the more important issue, for if BSES gets DPC, it will stop lifting 500 mw of power from Tata Power. For the latter, this could be tragic since it cannot possibly find a buyer for the excess power in the vicinity, especially since the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) says it has enough generation capacity of its own. 

BSES, on the other hand, apart from dealing a severe blow to Tata Power, may also be able take a relook at several of the other contentious projects on hand. ""If BSES were to gain control of the 2,184 mw power project, it would source the required 500 mw power from this project and stop buying it from the Tatas. Already, after BSES set up the 500 mw Dahanu power plant in Maharashtra, it has been buying consistently less power from the Tatas,"" say independent observers in the power industry. But a senior Tata executive defends the company's position. ""Our power plants have been built through World Bank funding which has been guaranteed by the Union government. Under these circumstances, power would have to be evacuated till the loans are repaid. We have time till 2014 when our licence expires,"" he said. But gaining control of DPC is hardly a simple issue. Urmik Chhaya, power analyst at Kotak Securities says: ""Any company which takes over this project will have to raise huge funds. How are they going to do that? The other question is where will they sell the power and what will be the payment security mechanism? These are the fundamental questions that will have to be addressed before any takeover of the project can be contemplated."" 

But Chhaya points out that DPC will be crucial to Tata Power's overall gameplan. ""After next year, how does Tata Power grow its power business?"" One estimate has it that anyone wanting to take over the power project will have to pay a minimum of $700 million. ""Assuming both companies bid at this reserve price, even at an exchange rate of Rs 47.50 to the dollar, they will have to pay Rs 3,325 crore. This is around 50 per cent of Tata Power's balance sheet size of Rs 6,465.95 crore and around 75 per cent of BSES's balance sheet size of Rs 4,327.40 crore. How will these two companies raise the money?"" says an analyst. 

However, a senior BSES executive points out that the company has a low gearing with a debt-equity ratio of 0.25:1. ""Raising Rs 2,000 crore at short notice is no problem at all. After all, what is the use of such a low debt-equity ratio otherwise,"" this executive asks. Tata group sources also say that raising finance is the least of their worries. ""We are the country's largest independent power producer with an installed generation capacity of over 2,000 mw. We can always raise money on the strength of our balance sheet,"" say Tata group executives. However, a change in management control at DPC will have to be accompanied by a series of legislative changes. First, if the new owner is not allowed to sell power outside Maharashtra, the project is unlikely to make any sense for the buyer. Particularly, as the state government has made it clear that it can absorb only 740 mw of the proposed 2,184 mw installed capacity. This will mean giving the Dabhol project a mega-power status. This is far from easy as this will need an amendment by Parliament as the project was not set up through the competitive bidding route but through a memorandum of understanding.

HC restrains Centre from encashing guarantees 

In an ad-interim order, Mumbai High Court has restrained the Centre and customs authorities from encashing guarantees undertaken by State Bank of India in regard to customs duty payable by Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Corporation for importing equipment to build liquified petroleum gas terminal in its Dabhol plant. The ex-parte injunction was granted by Justice D G Karnik on November 15 on a petition filed by DPC challenging the showcause notice issued by customs authorities asking the company to pay Rs 245 crore as import duty on the equipment. The Court also restrained the SBI to make payment under the guarantees undertaken by it on behalf of DPC. The Judge, however, allowed DPC to file an appeal before customs, excise and gold appellate tribunal within a period of four weeks from the date of his order. He also ruled that the ex-parte injunction order shall automatically stand vacated from December 15 subject to the orders that may be passed by the tribunal. Meanwhile, the court directed DPC to keep the bank guarantee enforceable.

DPC cancels Houston board meet, Sanjay Jog 

The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC), which is yet to recover from the shock following its acquisition by Dynegy last week, has cancelled its board meeting scheduled for November 19. The DPC board, which consists of two directors from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and one representing the state government, was to meet on Monday at Houston to delegate necessary powers to the Enron India managing director K Wade Cline for issuing a final termination notice to the MSEB. The DPC company secretary, in a faxed communication, has informed the MSEB chairman Vinay Bansal and the state principal energy secretary Vinay Mohan Lal that the board meeting slated for Monday has been cancelled until further announcement. 

Curiously, the DPC communication is silent over the reason for the cancellation of the November 19 meeting. Mr Bansal told The Financial Express on Sunday, ""I have been intimated by the DPC that November 19 meeting has been cancelled."" When contacted, DPC spokesman Jimmy Mogal declined to comment. MSEB, which holds 30 per cent stakes in the Dabhol phase-I (740 mw) in its letter of November 12 had asked the DPC not to hold a board meeting on November 19 in view of the Mumbai High Court restraining the DPC from issuing a final termination notice until further orders. The High Court in its judgement delivered on November 9 over a civil suit filed by the Indian financial institutions (IFIs) has slated the next hearing on December 3. 

Analysts said that the DPC's decision to cancel the November 19 meeting was quite expected as the company was aware that the situation in the wake of Enron's aquisition by Dynegy was fluid and it would need some time to take stock of the situation. Further, the Mumbai High Court's order, which gave a much-needed repreive to the MSEB as well as IFIs, came as a major setback to the DPC, which had already served an asset transfer notice to the MSEB on December 5. The MSEB had already communicated to the DPC that it would not be party to the DPC's decision to appoint a valuer after the issuance of asset transfer notice since it has rescinded the power purchase agreement on May 29 following a material misrepresentation and default on the availability of power by DPC. The IFIs had prayed that the issuance of final termination notice by DPC to MSEB would jeopardise their interest as well as investments in the ""distressed"" Dabhol project. 

The November 19 meeting was also to take up issues related to the asset preservation, the financial position of DPC relating to the phase-I, debt servicing, safeguarding the legal position of its directors and opening of letter of credit for shipping. The DPC board was quite worried especially over the upkeep of the Dabhol plant, which has been closed since May 29 when MSEB suspended power purchases. The construction contractors have also suspended construction works on Dabhol phase-II (1,444 mw) from June 17 in view of DPC's inability to make their payments. The DPC board would also have taken up the issue relating to the DPC's decision to pull out of the Dabhol project. The company, which had decided to sale its stakes at $1.2 billion, recently expressed its desire to reduce it at around $850 million.

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, November 19, 2001
Blackout in the power sector, A V Rajwade 

Every foreign company in the Indian power sector wants to exit. Of these, the most controversial has been Enron and its Dabhol Power Company Ltd (DPCL). This apart, the experience of investors in the ""reformed"" power sector in Orissa is also unhappy. Five years ago, Orissa was the first state to adopt the World Bank-recommended model of separating generation, transmission and distribution of power, and an independent regulator. The Godbole Committee has recently recommended the same for Maharashtra as well. Clearly, separating the three functions is a complex restructuring. Maybe it helps privatisation, the current fashion on the subject having been set in Thatcherite Britain. While some privatisations in UK have succeeded, the experience has not been consistent all over. 

Take UK's rail sector. While privatising, the government in its wisdom decided to separate the ownership of the rail network (Railtrack) and the ownership and operation of trains. The contractual relationship between the various operating companies and Railtrack were governed by a byzantine, bewilderingly complex system of penalties and incentives, to be monitored by an independent regulator. Such separation had no parallel. Besides, Railtrack suffered from poor management, cost escalation in modernisation of tracks, etc. Several serious accidents occurred and fixing responsibility became difficult. The ""reform"" did not work, and Railtrack was put back under public control last month. 

What are the chances of trifurcation of the power sector in India succeeding? Pretty poor, if the experience of Orissa is any guide. It faithfully separated the three functions, and privatised distribution and part of generation. AES, a foreign company, was 49 per cent investor in a generating company, and 51 per cent in CESCO, a distribution company. As Gajendra Haldea analysed in this paper on August 27, ""The policy and regulatory framework was inadequate and myopic."" Distribution losses, a euphemism for power theft, were much larger than the companies had been led to believe at the time of privatisation. CESCO defaulted in paying the dues of GRIDCO, the transmission company, which in turn defaulted to the generating company. Indeed, all CESCO's cash inflows are now escrowed, leaving it no money even to pay salaries. For all practical purposes, the distribution companies seem to be in a difficult situation, perhaps beyond redemption, and the ""reform"" is a total mess. The crux of the problem in the power sector is not whether a unified SEB is less efficient than trifurcated companies _ it is the political unwillingness to charge a price which covers the cost to all consumers. For a while, cross subsidisation worked with commercial consumers subsidising the household and the agricultural segments. 

However, as the burden became too large, the commercial sector started moving to captive generation, further worsening SEB finances. An ""independent"" regulator for power tariffs may not solve the problem. He may fix economic prices _ but will the state come forward to protect the bill collectors, punish power thiefs, face social unrest if power to recalcitrant consumers is cut off? So long as the answers to these questions are in the negative, as, sadly, they are, the institutional restructuring is no substitute for substantive action. No wonder all foreign investors in the power sector want to get out! 

Enron too wants out _ but it has many more problems in its home country, over and above its dispute with MSEB. It had attracted a lot of adverse publicity for gouging power consumers in California, a state in a power crisis (see World Money, February 2, 2001). The Internet craze also had a hand in Enron's misfortunes. It became an energy trader, established an electronic trading platform, had broadband ambitions, went into a disastrous diversification in water supplies which, if I remember correctly, led to Rebecca Mark's exit. Perhaps it went into too many areas too quickly under Jeffery Skilling, ex-McKinsey, and was notorious for opaque, complex accounts. 

To top it all, last month it announced that it will take an extraordinary $1.2 billion charge in its third quarter results for losses in financial activities. Enron's chief financial officer, who was supposed to be in charge of these, has resigned amidst reports that a private equity fund associated with him was involved in them. The SEC is investigating the affair and Enron's share price is down 67 per cent since mid-October. There are some reports that Shell may make a bid for Enron. After its ratings were downgraded, Enron is desperate for liquidity and anxious to dispose its assets. DPCL was already on the platter; now a sale has become even more urgent. Reportedly, Tatas and BSES are interested; so are the lending institutions. Clearly, if a settlement is to be reached, this is the optimum time. But one is not very optimistic. For one, Delhi and Mumbai will be involved, and bureaucracies never understand opportunity costs. Our byzantine decision-making processes make timely decisions impossible. Further, if a deal does take place, there will be the inevitable allegations of corruption. It is much safer for the reputation of the concerned ministers in Mumbai and Delhi to allow the drift to continue, to ""let the law take its own course"", whatever the costs! Sadly, as Jairam Ramesh said in this paper, Indian politicians respond to developments only out of compulsion, not conviction.

"From The Enron India Newsdesk - Oct 23rd Newsclips","THE FINANCIAL EXPRESS, Tuesday, October 23, 2001
Former SC judge Kurdukar to investigate Dabhol deal, Sanjay Jog 

The Maharashtra government on Monday has finally appointed the retired Supreme Court judge Sadashiv Kurdukar to head the judicial commission to probe into the multi-crore Dabhol Power Company (DPC) deal. Mr Kurdukar's name has been finalised at a meeting between the chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and state energy minister Padmasinh Patil. The commission is expected to complete its inquiry within six months since its appointment.. The formal announcement in this regard is expected after the weekly cabinet meeting on Wednesday. State government sources told The Financial Express that Mr Kurdukar's name has been shortlisted from the list of 15 judges by the law and judiciary department. Though former Supreme Court chief justice YV Chandrachud, former SC justices Sujata Manohar and PB Sawant were on forefront, they have believed to have expressed their inability to take on the job in view of their preoccupations.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

BUSINESS STANDARD, Monday, October 29, 2001
Enron to pull out of LNG shipping venture for Laxmi 

Before the final countdown begins for US energy major Enron's actual exit from Dabhol Power Company (DPC), it has decided to quit the greenfield shipping venture for Laxmi, the liquefied natural gas carrier expected to reach Indian shores on November 15. ""Enron's affiliate Atlantic Commercial Inc has expressed a desire to its partners to exit the special purpose vehicle for Laxmi in lieu of its decision to move out of the controversial DPC"", shipping industry sources said here today.  

An Enron India spokesperson declined to comment over the development. The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) has a 20 per cent stake in the $220 million project while Mitsui OSK Lines holds 60 per cent and the balance rests with Atlantic. Earlier, SCI chairman P K Srivastava had said they were confident of taking delivery of the vessel on November 15, despite the ANZ Investment Bank-led consortium's decision not to disburse the last tranche of $55 million. ""The 135,000 cubic metre capacity tanker, costing $189 million, is ready for delivery and we are currently in talks with banks and parties involved in this project"", sources said. SCI and Mitsui OSK Lines have a time charter for 10 years with DPC to transport LNG from Oman to Dabhol. The consortium of 14 banks has already disbursed $110 million, they added. 

Sources said SCI and OSK Lines have not ruled out alternatives such as deploying the vessel in the spot market due to the approaching winter demand for the liquid fuel and existing shortage of LNG vessels in the international market. ""LNG is an emerging fuel in international spot market and the consortium has already initiated exploratory steps. The reserves for winter season would be filled soon and there is lot of demand for such vessels"", they said. ""The multinational has already diverted its focus more on the futures trading aspects of the fuel. Given the present uncertainties, there is an unwarranted delay in the project, and so the carrier ""Laxmi"" would be used for chartering the natural gas to other countries from the middle east"", they explained. Registered in Malta, Laxmi was expected to carry two million tonne of LNG per annum to Dabhol to fire the power plant. The $800 million LNG terminal, which has a storage capacity of five million tonne of natural gas per year, was equipped to re-gassify the fuel and supply it to DPC while remaining to other bulk users. For LNG supply, DPC has signed a 20 year contract for 2.1 million tonne per year of the fuel with Oman LNG (1.6 million tonne per year) and Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company (480,000 tonne per year), the sources added.

When asked about the progress of negotiations with Tatas and BSES on a possible buyout of Enron's holding in DPC, IDBI chairman P P Vora said, These are on-going negotiations. There can not be any specific reply to it.""

Subject:	Eco Fuel Opportunities


Javier,

Attached is the memo Greg was referring to. We can discuss when you want. No $ value was calculated for these potential opportunities. I would imagine that the calculations would be very complex (if possible to do at all).

I thought of 1 more type of opportunity that could arise. If U.S. natural gas prices fall from one year to the next, Eco may be better off buying spot LNG rather than buying LNG from Cabot at the contract price. We are looking at this for the Year 2002.

Paul
