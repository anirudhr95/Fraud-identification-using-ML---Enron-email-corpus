"RE: Year 2000 Hedging Gains","Jaime,

Have you tried Gus Luna or Debbie Keller with Edison Mission? Gus was handling the actual transactions. I kept my own calculations of the settlement amounts but Gus should have copies of the settlement invoices from Enron.

Importance:	High

Paul:

I need to get some hard evidence (paperwork) that subtantiates the gain collected by Eco Holdings on the LPG hedging contracts for the year 2000. I do have copies of the contracts, but for audit purposes we need to have probably the worksheet where we signed off with Enron as to the amounts collected. Who can I talk to to get this?

"Ground Troops NOW!!!!!!!","
The U.S. needs to establish a very, very strong ground troop presence in Afghanistan as soon as possible. Until we accomplish this, we will not win over the Afghan people who would like to be rid of the Taliban. As of today, defection is very risky and maybe almost impossible. We need bases of operation in more than one area of the country. The logistics of feeding and sheltering and supplying these troops may be difficult but not impossible. The Afghan people need our support on the ground if they are going to rise up against the Taliban. 

We are currently losing the media war. If our ground troops were hailed as liberators by the Afghan people and that was broadcast all over the world, we would start winning the war of words. 

We must control ground very soon. There will be casualties on our side and the American people must prepare themselves mentally. We are fighting a ruthless, brutal enemy. Our resolve must increase, not diminish, when images of our casualties begin to come across our television screens. We must take down the Taliban and Bin Laden and other terrorists around the globe or face more attacks and loss of life in the United States.

Subject:	Need information concerning Co. 102, 214, and 218.

Hello,

I am a Tax Analyst currently working on Co. 102's (The Protane Corporation) and Co. 214's (Citadel Corporation Limited) federal tax returns. I need the following four issues resolved to complete their tax returns. If you are not the correct accountant(s), could you please tell me who is? I would appreciate this information by Friday, April 27.

It appears that on November 3, 2000 Co. 214 sold its 100% interest in Co. 218 (Citadel Venezolana, S.A.) to Co. 102 for 8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars. (If you need documentation for your research, I have the interoffice memo concerning this transaction.) There are four issues I have with this transaction:

1) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 still has an Investment in Subsidiary balance of $1,760,000 and Equity Earnings of $494,508.83 relating to Co. 218. Should not these balances be $0? Also would there have been an intercompany gain/loss associated with this stock sale? 

2) As of 12/31/00, Co. 102 shows no Investment in Subsidiary nor Equity Earnings balance relating to Co. 218. Should not there be a balance for Co. 218 which equals the USD equivalent of $8,000,000 Venezuelan Bolivars? Also, should not the Equity Earnings ($494,508.83) from Co. 218 posted on Co. 214 be posted on Co. 102?

3) As of 12/31/00, Co. 218 shows capital stock of $1,760,000 owned by Co. 214. Should not this capital stock be shown to be owned by Co. 102?

4) As of 12/31/00, Co. 214 is showing a $6,000,000 entry in ""Other Deductions"" (The credit side of the journal entry hits ""Deferred Credits."").  I need more detail concerning this amount. Could this be the consideration received from Co. 102 relating to the stock sale mentioned above?

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Thank you for your time,
Khrissy Griffin

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

As we analyze what and how to deal with your next cargo requirements, we need the following information:

-	Current levels of inventory at Procaribe, broken down between your own and Eco's product - projected as of end of September (please provide basis; i.e., levels of as of the actual date that you provide data plus your projections through end of the month on withdrawals/uses)
-	Projected sales volumes for the months of  October, November, December and January of next year, including (and this is very critical!) the basis for your projections.  I am going to be interested in looking at your assumptions for both Progasco (now Tropigas) and Empire volumes, if any.
-	Please ensure that your San Juan Gas volumes have been signed off by Federico.

We need this data as soon as you can so that we can begin to look at cargo options and/or evaluate the decision to borrow from Eco.

Thanks and Regards, Mariella

Paul,

Believe it or not (yes, call me crazy!), I went home last night and continued to study the examples of hedging you were so kind to walk us through and arrived at the following conclusions, which I would like for you to correct me on and/or confirm my thought process.  

-	First, given the added uncertainty of Procaribe's volumes (sales) now that Progasco is owned by someone else, unless Miguel can guarantee (through some form of written agreement) that he will have Progasco's volumes, I think we should be more open to or more inclined to borrow Eco's volumes (clearly, we wouldn't do so if the curve looks awful - then it becomes an issue of cash flow vs. product pricing optimization).
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Without the Progasco volume, it will take much longer to sell-off this cargo. The hedging would be different. If Humberto unexpectedly showed up to buy, the timing of our hedge would be off. I think we should sign-up Humberto for Nov-Dec at whatever we can get. Come January it will be a new ballgame as Empire will need to get a new contract with PDVSA. We could probably up our price at that time.

-	Second, it seems to me that you wouldn't me too inclined to try to fix the cost of your product bought from, say, PDVSA, unless you are very concerned about an increasing curve (right around the 3 days surrounding the bill of lading) that will not necessarily stay long enough to keep your ""sales"" curve up to guarantee a margin.  In fact, you would likely wait and continue to watch the curve and either not act at all or act shortly before the bill of lading dates.  Now, in your May hedging example, if you actually compare the hedged vs. non-hedged results, it tells you that you were better off with a no hedge on the earlier months (month for which data on the revenue side was known and most of the curve deciding your price to PDVSA was also known).  Then, my question is: why did we decide to hedge that volume when the hedge was put in place on 5/9, only a week or so before the actual bill of lading date? Do you remember what was concerning us?
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
You would hedge the purchase cost if you were going to be repaying borrowings and you liked the price you could lock-in. Also, as you say, if you were concerned that prices during your sales period would not hold their value relative to the 3-days around B/L. Yes, we missed $0.003/gallon by hedging the part of the cargo that was sold in April and early May. We were not particularly concerned about anything. Just wanted to be rid of the possibility that prices could have gone up a penny or two.

-	Third, it seems to me that, on the May hedge, (the second part of the volume) someone lost big time - I could be wrong, but what I'm looking at is the fix we got (Suzanne got) in return for the floating; the fix rate was much higher than the actual MBv figures for the months of June and July (this assumes of course the Enron didn't turn around and laid off that risk on someone else).  What I am trying to say is that, there appears to have been something going on with the curve on or around 5/21 that changed dramatically once actual figures were recorded.  Do you remember?  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
LPG prices dropped dramatically in June going below $0.35 per gallon. Normally, no one in Enron would get hurt because Lee Jackson would have hedged himself with someone outside of the company. However, he actually left his position open and lost about $300k. That does not impact us.

-	Fourth, it seems to me that your swaps were being built around a primary objective (beyond risk protection): to deliver approximately 5 cents per gallon margin to Miguel.  Anytime we have that opportunity, we should grab it.  
[Y'Barbo, Paul]  
Yes, I want to lock the margin but if possible I like to improve it to above the $0.05.

That's all for now - - I'll keep studying this ... What I am trying to do is draw some conclusions as to the circumstances under which we will want to swap the purchase cost (it's clear to me that, most of the times, once you know what your cost is, you will try to lock in your margin by doing a swap using your revenue stream; i.e., the Mbv basis).


Thanks again for all your time and patience.

Mariella

Subject:	Eco Winter Cargo

Below are the key points of a conference call held on Friday, May 11, 2001. Attending were Gene Massey of Arent Fox and Coralina Rivera, Dan Masters, and Paul Y'Barbo of Enron. The call was in reference to the LNG supply contract between EcoElectrica and Cabot LNG. Enron LNG got the answers it hoped to get and more.

1. Article 12.3 gives Cabot the right to not deliver a Winter Cargo to Eco if Cabot is unable to complete an Algerian Loading within a window specified in the contract. Cabot could give notice to Eco as late as 3 days prior to the scheduled loading of the Winter Cargo that Cabot will be unable to deliver the cargo. The failure to complete the Algerian Loading must not be the result of a default by Cabot or Distrigas. The failure to achieve an Algerian Loading may not necessarily be the result of an Algerian Force Majeure situation. 

2. Article 12.3 (b) (iv) gives Eco the right to secure replacement fuel for the Winter Cargo. If Eco notices Cabot that Eco has the opportunity to secure replacement fuel, then Cabot has 10 days to notify Eco whether or not they are willing to release the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Eco may buy replacement fuel regardless of whether or not Cabot releases the right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. In other words, even if Cabot commits to delivery of a Winter Cargo, Eco is under no obligation to purchase a Winter Cargo from Cabot. 

If Cabot is unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo, then Eco will buy the replacement fuel and will not have to pay the Demand Charge or Demand Surcharge on the Winter Cargo, a quantity equal to 119,000 cubic meters (~$4.7 MM).

If Cabot releases its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo and Eco still buys the replacement fuel, then Eco will receive no reduction in the annual Demand Charges and Demand Surcharge.

Eco has until December 1st to give notice that it has the opportunity to buy replacement fuel. It was Gene's opinion that the sooner Eco gives notice (today would be good), the less likely Cabot would be willing to give up its right to not deliver the Winter Cargo. Thus, the more likely Eco would be able to get a reduction in Demand Charges and elimination of the Demand Surcharge.

Important Note: The economics of the deal work such that the largest monetary benefit of buying replacement fuel exists when December/January/February U.S. natural gas prices are at their lowest point of the year.

If U.S. natural gas prices were to go down a little further, Eco would want to buy more non-Cabot LNG than just the Winter Cargo replacement.

3. Per Article 7.5, Eco's annual purchase commitment is 66% of the LNG consumed at the Power Facility up to a maximum of 19.46 TBtu (~7 Standard Cargoes). In a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco would need to ""purchase"" 6 Standard Cargoes from Cabot. Failure to do so would result in payment of liquidated damages of approximately $0.36/MMBtu.

Important Note: Per Article 7.5, if replacement fuel is purchased rather than buying a Winter Cargo from Cabot, that quantity counts as though it were purchased from Cabot for the purpose of assessing whether or not Eco met its annual purchase commitment. Thus, in a year in which the Power Facility consumes 9 Standard Cargoes, Eco could buy replacement fuel instead of a Cabot Winter Cargo plus 5 Standard Cargoes from Cabot and still meet its annual commitment.

There are benefits to Eco for buying replacement fuel - certainty of supply and a lower price. Enron LNG should continue to pursue a deal with Eco. I plan to schedule a meeting with Mariella Mahan as soon as she is available.

I will provide an update of the economics of this trade in my next e-mail.

Hi Paul,

I'd like to get some more information before following up on your request.

Could you please provide the following so I can research this.
1. Effective Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/1998 
2. Effective End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	10/19/2001 
3. Ref Begin Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	01/01/2002 
4. Ref End Date [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	12/31/2006 
5. Publication [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG 
6. Curve Code [Y'Barbo, Paul]  	NG

[Y'Barbo, Paul]  Also, since my note yesterday, I found price data on 09/30/2000 (a Saturday) in the data that was returned to me. Those prices were the same as those on 09/29/2000. I am most concerned with the prices given for 09/16/2001 (a Sunday). It is easy enough to delete those prices. Are the prices on 09/17/2001 to 10/19/2001 good? 

Sorry to ask for these again, but these specifics are needed to analyze the data that was returned to you. 

Thanks,
Kim

Paul,

The invoices for this lifting were issued with provisional pricing on November 1 and I was assured that payment would be made on the due date of today basis those invoicese.  It has been evident for a while now that the prices for foward months would be going down, but this is the first day I'm hearing that ProCaribe wants revised invoices.

It doesn't need to be said that cash forecasting is very important to Enron at this time and based on previous conversations, I had confirmed to the forecasting group that they would receive the funds today.

The revised invoices will be issued tomorrow.  I need confirmation that the payment of the balance due will be made tomorrow, without fail.  Per my calculations, balance due would be $1,406,580.96 taking into account the $1,000,00.00 payment that was made today.

Please confirm.

Best regards,
Suzanne

"RE: Status","Alton,

Thanks for the concern. Fortunately, I transferred to one of Enron's pipeline companies in mid-September (just before things started getting really crazy). This is the most stable part of the company and we will survive no matter what ... although we may be owned by someone other than Enron. I was also fortunate to have very little Enron stock exposure. Many of my friends have not been so fortunate. They are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth.

Andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also. I don't understand how they could have allowed Enron to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet.

Are you all going to Port Neches for Thanksgiving? Renee and I are going tonight. I hope that you all have a very nice Thanksgiving and Christmas.

Many Happy Returns,

Paul

"Update - EcoElectrica Winter Cargo","If the last Hoegh Galleon cargo of this year is diverted to Puerto Rico, the economics of sending non-Cabot LNG to Puerto Rico are different than those mentioned in my prior note.

Based on current prices, there is $0.7 MM of value that could be captured between Enron LNG and Eco on the diversion. This represents the price difference between what it would cost to buy back our sale to ENA at CMS and what Eco would have had to pay Cabot for a Winter Cargo. If CMS would let us out of the terminal fee or let it apply to a future delivery, that would add an additional $1 MM of value. If Cabot had to give up its Demand Charge and Demand Surcharge (hard to imagine) on the Winter Cargo, that adds another $4.7 MM.

A second Hoegh Galleon cargo should add $1.5 MM but would need to be sourced from Nigeria or Algeria(???). 

Cabot controls the date of the Last Cargo delivered in 2001. It can be November 23-December 15 (unless another date is mutually agreeable). The date of this last delivery determines the earliest date that Eco would be able to receive the Hoegh Galleon. The earliest that Eco could receive the Hoegh Galleon should therefore be between December 20 and January 11 - depends on Cabot. 

Eco would be able to receive a second Hoegh Galleon cargo as soon as 29 days after the first Hoegh Galleon cargo delivery or as late as 45 days after. Two Hoegh Galleon cargoes should give Eco enough fuel (barely) to get them to the dates where they are eligible to receive the Early Spring cargo (100 days after the Last Cargo of 2001). 

In addition to the $$$'s available to be captured, this program removes Eco's risk of not receiving a Winter Cargo from Cabot.

Economics and Timing -  The amount of value to be captured is most heavily influenced by December-January NYMEX prices. These impact our cost to buy back gas at the CMS tailgate and our cost to buy the second Hoegh Galleon cargo. Our gas cost is more subject to change than is the Cabot contract price we are trying to beat. If we had a crystal ball, we would lock-in the economics of the diversion and of the purchase of the second cargo when the NYMEX bottoms-out. The front of the price curve has lost ~$1.00/MMBtu in the last 2 weeks. Where will it go from here?

In order to be prepared to execute when market conditions are right, we need to get Eco on board and initiate discussions with a producer about supply for the second cargo. Also, we should talk with Gene Massey to confirm that the contract says what we think it says and to get his thoughts on what we are trying to do.

I would appreciate any insights that you may have regarding this opportunity.

Regards,

Paul

Subject:	PNM Invoices for Contract #24194

I tried to send out an email to you from home last week but received an error while sending.  So I'll try again (sorry for the delay in my response).

This contract was negotiated at a one-part daily rate of $0.1100/dth.  However, because the shipper's usage each month was significantly lower than the contracted mdq, they were billed less than the contracted rate (using the applicable max tariff rates for demand and usage).

I reviewed the invoices for the time period May 2001 - September 2001 and these are the results regarding necessary adjustments:

May 2001 - ok
June 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery points #58710 and #500084 ($568.87)
July 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
August 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($217.00)
September 2001 - bill GRI on commodity invoice for delivery point #500084 ($189.00) and delete the Credit for Commodity on reservation invoice ($251.10)

NOTE:  The GRI adjustments do not impact TW's bottom line because the monies collected from PNM for these surcharges are passed through to the Gas Research Institute.  The only impact to our revenue is the deletion of the Credit for Commodity.

Please let me know when you are ready to make the rate adjustments and I can walk you through the process.  Then we can get with the schedulers to re-generate these invoices.


Thanks,
Elizabeth

"Eco Fuel Consumption","Oscar,

Per our conversation, the following are the fuel management team's assumptions of fuel requirements for Eco at 100% of capacity:

LNG   91,260 MMBtu/day at 507 MW    Heat Rate = 7500 BTU/kwh

LPG   1905 Metric Tons at 507 MW     Heat Rate = 7461 BTU/kwh    (Note: 522 gallons/MT   ,   91,300 Btu/gallon)

No.2   619,000 gallons/day at 465 MW   Heat Rate = 7313 BTU/kwh    (Note: 131,850 Btu/gallon)


Heat rates at less than 100% of capacity will be different from those at 100%. Check with Rick or Arthur regarding performance curves.

Call me if you have any additional questions.

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

26511		21,000/d to Needles


TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

25841		29,000/d to Topock
		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

Shubh,

The only publication that I have been getting is World Gas Intelligence published by Energy Intelligence Group. I can FAX you my latest copy if you are interested. Also, they have a web site:  www.energyintel.com

Poten & Partners' main number in New York is 212 230-2000. Also, there is a sample issue of LNG in World Markets at www.poten.com. I spoke with Lizette Valentin (Poten) and she says the lowest cost way for you to get the publication is to be added on to Clay Harris's subscription for $500/year. Lizette's number is 212 230-2086. The website also has the form that you need to fill out to get added on to Clay's subscription. 

Call me and we can look at the website together.

I am also anxious to get some news regarding the lenders' meeting in Singapore.

Take Care,

I was wondering if you are getting some LNG industry reports/analysis e.g. ""LNG in World Markets"" published by Poten & Partners.  If yes, would it be convenient for you to arrange a copy of the same for DPC?

As I write this mail, the DPC lenders meet is still going on in Singapore.  All of us are anxiously waiting to know the outcome.

Paul,

I reviewed the data in the CBS system as well as the contract folders in order to respond to your questions.  Here are my findings:
Information regarding delivery point volumes provided by TK are correct.  
The requests for realignment on both contracts were effective 4/1/01 through the remaining term of the contracts.
There is a copy of the executed amendments in the respective contract folders and/or in Envision (K 25841 - amendment #66, K 26511 - amendment #34)
K 25841 has no language prohibiting PG&E ET-GC to realign during the term of the agreement
K 26511 does have language in a discount letter agreement dated 5/27/99 stating ""Shipper shall have a one time option during the term of the discount agreement while retaining the discounted rate to change primary delivery point capacity to PG&E Topock, subject to the availability of capacity at such point.""

If you have any questions, please let me know.  I'll give you a call with this information as well.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Elizabeth,

The original delivery points for these contracts were:

25841		40,000/d to Topock

26511		21,000/d to Needles


TK tells me that now the delivery points are:

25841		29,000/d to Topock
		11,000/d to Needles

26511		11,000/d to Topock
		10,000/d to Needles

Can you tell me if this is correct? If yes, will these delivery points and volumes be in effect until the end of the contract? Can they be changed again? Do we have paperwork documenting the change?

Craig Buehler told me that Dennis Lee x-3-7115 could be of assistance. Could you speak with him?

I will be out for the rest of the week. Please call me at 713 825-8046 when you figure this out.

Many Thanks,

"EcoElectrica LNG Cargo in January 2002","Based on today's closing NYMEX prices there is $1.9 MM of price difference between EcoElectrica's 2002 Winter Cargo Commodity Charge plus Commodity Surcharge and the delivered cost of 83,000 CBM of LNG. That is $5.61 vs $4.61. This assumes we pay a day rate of $50,000/day for the vessel, Jan '02 NYMEX is $5.41, and the FOB price for LNG is $2.66. 

Let's stay in touch about the possibilty of landing a spot cargo into Puerto Rico in January. As we discussed, how we play this with Cabot is a big issue. There could be an additional $4.7 MM of value that could be captured by Eco if Cabot were unable to release its right to not deliver a Winter Cargo. Also, let's continue to think about how we make the logistics work and how we can get Cabot's cooperation if needed.

Also, note that Eco may need 2 cargoes of this size to make it until the Early Spring Cargo.

"EOG Interconnect - Lipscomb Co., TX","
Walt,

EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12"" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  

I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas. 

Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?

"EcoElectrica LNG Requirements for Remainder of 2001","The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

Lorraine and Paul:   Greetings.  Our first invoice under our new firm transportation agreement is incorrect.  I have asked our accounting people to call Laura Giambrone to discuss but wanted to bring this to your attention in case she needs your assistance to understand the terms of our deal.  The invoice includes a ""reservation"" charge equal to the October MDQ times the number of days in the month times the discount rate, which is correct (35,000 x 31 x $0.08 = $86,800).  However, the invoice also includes a ""commodity"" charge of $3,945.47.  

I believe it is just a matter of setting it up correctly in the computer because the invoices we received under our old contract also included a ""reservation"" charge and a ""commodity"" charge, but the two together equaled the negotiated rate.  I would appreciate any help you could provide to get this set up correctly and our October invoice corrected.

It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

Subject:	Freight Rates - West Africa - Med / Caribs

Paul, in comparing freight rates for Med vs Caribs and Caribs vs Caribs (cargo size), I do see Bo's point.  

For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.:
	$50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and 
 	$60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs

however,

the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows:
	$30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and
	$40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs

So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to 
Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00.

Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better.

Let me know your thoughts.

Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.  I would hesitate to purchase from an alternative source lest they back off on other negotiations.

Best regards,
Suzanne

DPC lenders put off preliminary termination notice Anto Joseph 

MUMBAI : THE INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India has once again prevented Enron-promoted 2,144-mega-watt Dabhol Power Company from issuing a preliminary termination notice. Bowing to pressure from IDBI, off-shore lenders have agreed to extend the deadline to May 25 for the Maharashtra government and Enron to settle the ongoing payment crisis. However, lenders are going to monitor developments on a daily basis. 

Lenders who held a conference call late evening at IDBI Tower in South Mumbai have decided to postpone issuing the termination notice by a week. Many off-shore lenders of the $2.9-billion DPC are still in favour of issuance of a preliminary termination notice to the Maharashtra government. A preliminary termination notice gives six months to the government agencies to deal with the problems facing the project. It is the starting point of the process of terminating the project. 

When lenders met last time in London on April 23-24, lead lender IDBI had successfully persuaded off-shore lenders not to allow Enron to go ahead with the termination notice. Lenders had informally agreed to lend time -- around two weeks -- to the government of India to sort out payment related issues. The Maharashtra government has, in the meantime, set up the Godbole Committee to renegotiate the project. 

In the meeting in London, most lenders had proposed a dialogue between the government and Enron rather than going in for any precipitative action. Without the lenders' approval, Enron could not go ahead with its proposal at its board meeting held on April 25. In the board meeting, the company had authorised two persons -- Wade Cline, managing director of Enron India and Neil McGregor, president and CEO of Dabhol Power Company -- to issue the termination notice, whenever lenders agree. 

The Indian lenders, led by IDBI, have continued to oppose the termination move. Termination of the project is expected to hurt Indian lenders since, unlike foreign lenders, their exposure risks are not covered under the government guarantee. While the phase II of the 2184 mega-watt power project is under construction at Dabhol in Maharashtra, and part of which is getting ready for commercial operation in June, the phase I that produces 740 mw of electricity has run into a major payment tussle with the sole buyer MSEB. 

Indian financial institutions and banks have contributed around 60 per cent of the debt for DPC with a $1.2 billion exposure. The $2.9-billion project was lead-arranged by IDBI, and a substantial chunk of Indian debt came from IDBI, SBI, ICICI and IFCI. Of the $2 billion debt, $1.6 billion have already been invested in the project. More than 80 per cent of the phase II is already over, and Enron was expecting the phase to go operational by the year-end. The project, the largest FDI in India so far, was financed by a consortium of around 40 commercial banks -- including ANZ Grindlays, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and Citibank. Half a dozen governments including the US, Japan, Belgium, Oman and India have participated in the project financing through various state-owned financial institutions and Exim agencies. 

The recent stand-off between the state government-owned power utility and the US power major stemmed from a payment crisis. MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last year and subsequently defaulted payments, claiming that the cost of power produced by DPC is exorbitant. It also slapped a penalty bill of around Rs 401 crore and is going to slap another Rs 740 crore on DPC for failing to produce electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours after the cold start. Enron India had subsequently invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees, and political force majeure and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause.

DPC lenders meet adjourned for today 

MUMBAI: The on-going global lenders meet of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) over allowing the multinational to issue a pre-termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has been adjourned for Friday. 
""Talks with the foreign lenders would continue Friday as Thursday's session has been adjourned,"" top financial institution sources said here. The Indian lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), on Thursday participated in the discussions with their international counterparts and tried to persuade the latter to restrain DPC from issuing the pre-termination notice to the loss making board, sources said. 
Technically, the permission to serve the termination notice could be given if 4 per cent of the total lenders were in its favour. The lenders have been discussing the issue since Wednesday by way of tele-conferencing across the globe. DPC's foreign lenders include J-Exim, Citibank NA, and ABN Amro among others. (PTI)

India asks Enron to renegotiate Dabhol contract 

HONG KONG : INDIA has told US energy company Enron it should renegotiate its contentious power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha said on Thursday. 

""We have suggested to Enron that they should seriously renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the government of Maharashtra, because there are certain elements in that power purchase agreement which can undergo a change,"" Sinha said. 

Enron and India have been sparring for six months over payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for power purchased from Dabhol Power Company. A Dabhol spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on Sinha's statement. He reiterated the company's previously stated position that it is ready for a dialogue to resolve all issues, but a renegotiation of the contract is not on offer. 

DPC has already held a meeting with a Maharashtra government committee and is slated to meet them again on May 23. ""Since the purpose of the meeting is only to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal,"" Dabhol said on May 3. 

DPC is building the world's largest natural gas fired power plant on India's western coast. The 740 megawatt first phase of the facility began operating in 1999. The plant's generating capacity will triple to 2,184 mw when phase two is completed next month. MSEB agreed in 1995 to buy all the power produced by the plant, but now says the power is too expensive, and is refusing to take the additional second-phase capacity. Its change of mind has sparked concern over the fate of the project. DPC has already issued a notice of arbitration, and last month its board authorised management to terminate the contract. A vote on Thursday by lenders to the project is expected to endorse the board's decision, a source close to the matter told Reuters. 

Sinha said he had no comment on the vote. He also declined to reveal the Center's opinion of MSEB's refusal to buy the second-phase power. (Reuters)

Deshmukh convenes meet to discuss Dabhol crisis Sanjay Jog  
Mumbai, May 17: Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on Saturday with state officials, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing Dabhol crisis.
Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that the issues relate to renegotiations with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) like the proposed arbitration proceedings, the Centre's reluctance to purchase Dabhol phase-II power, and issuance of preliminary termination notice to the DPC are likely to to come up prominently at the Saturday's meeting. Furthermore, the meeting would also discuss at length the DPC's refusal to pay rebate of Rs 401-crore charged by MSEB for the mis-declaration and default on the availability of power on January 28. MSEB will complete the review of rebate payment by end of this month and serve another rebate of Rs 400 crore to DPC.
MSEB and state energy department are likely to seek chief minister's intervention to take up the issue of despatch of Dabhol power from phase-II by the Centre in view of their inability to bear additional burden. In fact, the state energy department and MSEB were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power Suresh Prabhu that neither National Thermal Power Corporation nor Power Trading Corportion are in a position to purchase or trade Dabhol power to other states. 
Moreover, the energy department and MSEB were of the view that the Centre, which has provided a Counter Guarantee for Dabhol phase-I, cannot remain as a silent observer, but should bail out the state government and MSEB. The chief minister's meeting is also likely to discuss the ""cold"" response from the union ministries of power, finance and oil and petroleum in reaching at an acceptable solution. Ironically, the Centre, which has decided to adopt a conciliatory route, has yet to prepare a reply to the DPC's notice served on April 4 for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore.
Sources said that the state government would make a fresh appeal to the Centre to implement a common strategy in defending the stand of MSEB, Centre and state governments at the proposed arbitration proceedings.

'Affordable DPC tariff must to woo third-party buyers' 
The Centre should benchmark ""an affordable"" tariff of Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) liquified natural gas (LNG) based power, so as to enable the Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to buy and distribute power from the US energy major, according to a senior official of Maharashtra government.
""Now that DPC is ready for renegotiations, why does the Centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational's LNG-based power?,"" the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by Union power minister Suresh Prabhu that the Centre would allow sale of power to a ""willing buyer"" if DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) jointly approach with a concrete proposal. 
The Union government is also a part of the Godbole panel and the former should not undermine its responsibility merely by stating that ""we would try and offer all the help"", the official said. When asked if DPC and MSEB would be able to find a ""willing party"" for the US energy major's costly power, the official said, DPC was ready to reduce the tariff and bring it down to an affordable level following which either NTPC or PTC could source it and pass on to the power-starved north Indian states. 
Last evening, Prabhu had said the Centre would give any status, including a mega project one, if MSEB and DPC approach the Centre for the same together. Prabhu had said that his ministry would extend its cooperation to the state government ""in every way"" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. The minister also categorically stated that NTPC could not buy DPC's power, as it was a mere ""power selling entity"". ""There was no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long-term power purchase agreements have been signed by NTPC with the buying states,"" he said.
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 mw needed for the state from the 740 mw Phase-I and soon to be commissioned Phase-II of 1,444 mw, to other needy states.

BUSINESS STANDARD Friday, May 18, 2001
BYSTANDER - Dangerous drift on Dabhol
The Central and state governments have failed to manage the Dabhol crisis effectively, writes John Elliott

No-one seems to be terribly concerned that Enron's $3 billion power project at Dabhol, which is India's most high profile foreign investment, looks as if it is heading rapidly into a meltdown. 
Even stories that Enron is shifting executives' families out of the country - surely the actions of an organisation that is clearing the decks for a showdown - attract relatively little attention. International lenders have suspended loans, and contractors on the Dabhol site are said to be withdrawing. This is no longer - as Suresh Prabhu, the power minister, has put it - merely the sort of ""dispute between a generator and a distributor"" that has happened in many other countries. 
Sure it started out as that; but it now looks as though Enron plans to take its recent force majeure notice to its logical conclusion and withdraw from India as soon as it can. One does not need a lawyer to realise that Maharashtra has unwittingly been helping Enron assemble evidence of force majeure ever since demands for renegotiation or cancellation of the project came from the state assembly's during its noisy sojourn in Nagpur last November. 
After that, the Maharashtra government stoked the flames by calling for cancellation and by demanding on three separate occasions that the plant should move from being idle to full production in three hours. That is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the Dabhol equipment is not designed to meet. Then the Central government used this time-limit issue as an excuse for not paying Enron money that was due under the project's finance ministry counter guarantee. 
This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive. 
Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve. 
For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start. 
The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra. 
Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial and management capabilities and reach. 
But time is running out and it does not look as if Enron will wait much longer. If it does terminate the contract - and maybe puts the Dabhol company into bankruptcy - India's image will suffer because of the government's failure to pay the counter guarantees, which could well be presented as the central issue. The only beneficiary of this disaster would be the company that eventually picks up the pieces at Dabhol because it will obtain the project at a knockdown price. 
This may sound as if I am arguing that Enron is in the right. I am not. What I am arguing however is that the Central and state governments have failed to manage this crisis effectively. Instead they are treating it with a characteristic sense of drift - assuming no doubt that, like so many crises in this country, it will solve itself - which it will not. 
If anyone doubts Enron's motive for ridding itself of its India business, just look at its recent first quarter results: profits up 20 per cent to $406 million on sales that had almost quadrupled to $50 billion. Does anyone seriously think that Dabhol matters to such an international commodities trader?

Godbole panel not to seek replacements Our Regional Bureau in Mumbai
Chairman of the renegotiation committee appointed to hold discussions with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) Madhav Godbole, on Wednesday said the remaining six members on the committee were adequate to fruitfully continue negotiations with the power major. 
Responding to a query whether the withdrawal by three appointees on the committee -- EAS Sarma, RK Pachouri and Kirit Parikh -- would hamper negotiations with DPC considering their respective expertise in fields of finance and power, Godbole told Business Standard, ""I would not like to get into such an argument. As far as the committee is concerned we would not be seeking fresh inductions."" He was reacting to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's statement made earlier on Wednesday, wherein he said the government would wait for the chairman of the renegotiation committee to make a requisition for new members on the committee.
Deshmukh also told mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, ""We have repeatedly informed the centre of our inability to absorb the DPC power that would become available following the completion of phase II of the project."" He also observed that while Maharashtra was keen to ensure the active participation of individual members from the Union finance, energy and legal ministries for a fruitful dialogue process with DPC, the appointment of retired bureaucrat AV Gokak was not clear on some issues.
""Whether Gokak is authorised by the centre with some powers to negotiate on its behalf is not clear as of now. However, with renegotiations currently on, we would like to await the committee's deliberations,"" he said. The next meeting of the renegotiating committee with DPC is scheduled for May 23.

Great to hear back.  Jenny and I have just returned from a short trip to
Beijing, where we were antique shopping and eating great Chinese food.

Life in Hong Kong is fast paced and revolves around work.  I travel
throughout the region making private equity investments.  Weekends are a
time to catch up on sleep.  Pretty boring stuff.

I was very happy to hear that you have settled down.   Glad to see that you
have found someone who can put up with your ideosyncracies (I am kidding,
of course).

What are you doing at Enron?

Best,
Edan

Walt,

EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12"" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  

I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas. 

Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?

Thanks,

Paul

DPC lenders put off preliminary termination notice Anto Joseph 

MUMBAI : THE INDUSTRIAL Development Bank of India has once again prevented Enron-promoted 2,144-mega-watt Dabhol Power Company from issuing a preliminary termination notice. Bowing to pressure from IDBI, off-shore lenders have agreed to extend the deadline to May 25 for the Maharashtra government and Enron to settle the ongoing payment crisis. However, lenders are going to monitor developments on a daily basis. 

Lenders who held a conference call late evening at IDBI Tower in South Mumbai have decided to postpone issuing the termination notice by a week. Many off-shore lenders of the $2.9-billion DPC are still in favour of issuance of a preliminary termination notice to the Maharashtra government. A preliminary termination notice gives six months to the government agencies to deal with the problems facing the project. It is the starting point of the process of terminating the project. 

When lenders met last time in London on April 23-24, lead lender IDBI had successfully persuaded off-shore lenders not to allow Enron to go ahead with the termination notice. Lenders had informally agreed to lend time -- around two weeks -- to the government of India to sort out payment related issues. The Maharashtra government has, in the meantime, set up the Godbole Committee to renegotiate the project. 

In the meeting in London, most lenders had proposed a dialogue between the government and Enron rather than going in for any precipitative action. Without the lenders' approval, Enron could not go ahead with its proposal at its board meeting held on April 25. In the board meeting, the company had authorised two persons -- Wade Cline, managing director of Enron India and Neil McGregor, president and CEO of Dabhol Power Company -- to issue the termination notice, whenever lenders agree. 

The Indian lenders, led by IDBI, have continued to oppose the termination move. Termination of the project is expected to hurt Indian lenders since, unlike foreign lenders, their exposure risks are not covered under the government guarantee. While the phase II of the 2184 mega-watt power project is under construction at Dabhol in Maharashtra, and part of which is getting ready for commercial operation in June, the phase I that produces 740 mw of electricity has run into a major payment tussle with the sole buyer MSEB. 

Indian financial institutions and banks have contributed around 60 per cent of the debt for DPC with a $1.2 billion exposure. The $2.9-billion project was lead-arranged by IDBI, and a substantial chunk of Indian debt came from IDBI, SBI, ICICI and IFCI. Of the $2 billion debt, $1.6 billion have already been invested in the project. More than 80 per cent of the phase II is already over, and Enron was expecting the phase to go operational by the year-end. The project, the largest FDI in India so far, was financed by a consortium of around 40 commercial banks -- including ANZ Grindlays, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo and Citibank. Half a dozen governments including the US, Japan, Belgium, Oman and India have participated in the project financing through various state-owned financial institutions and Exim agencies. 

The recent stand-off between the state government-owned power utility and the US power major stemmed from a payment crisis. MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last year and subsequently defaulted payments, claiming that the cost of power produced by DPC is exorbitant. It also slapped a penalty bill of around Rs 401 crore and is going to slap another Rs 740 crore on DPC for failing to produce electricity within the stipulated time period of three hours after the cold start. Enron India had subsequently invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees, and political force majeure and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause.

DPC lenders meet adjourned for today 

MUMBAI: The on-going global lenders meet of Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) over allowing the multinational to issue a pre-termination notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has been adjourned for Friday. 
""Talks with the foreign lenders would continue Friday as Thursday's session has been adjourned,"" top financial institution sources said here. The Indian lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), on Thursday participated in the discussions with their international counterparts and tried to persuade the latter to restrain DPC from issuing the pre-termination notice to the loss making board, sources said. 
Technically, the permission to serve the termination notice could be given if 4 per cent of the total lenders were in its favour. The lenders have been discussing the issue since Wednesday by way of tele-conferencing across the globe. DPC's foreign lenders include J-Exim, Citibank NA, and ABN Amro among others. (PTI)

THE ECONOMIC TIMES Friday, May 18, 2001  
India asks Enron to renegotiate Dabhol contract 

HONG KONG : INDIA has told US energy company Enron it should renegotiate its contentious power purchase agreement with the Maharashtra government, finance minister Yashwant Sinha said on Thursday. 

""We have suggested to Enron that they should seriously renegotiate the power purchase agreement with the government of Maharashtra, because there are certain elements in that power purchase agreement which can undergo a change,"" Sinha said. 

Enron and India have been sparring for six months over payment defaults by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board for power purchased from Dabhol Power Company. A Dabhol spokesman on Thursday declined to comment on Sinha's statement. He reiterated the company's previously stated position that it is ready for a dialogue to resolve all issues, but a renegotiation of the contract is not on offer. 

DPC has already held a meeting with a Maharashtra government committee and is slated to meet them again on May 23. ""Since the purpose of the meeting is only to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposal,"" Dabhol said on May 3. 

DPC is building the world's largest natural gas fired power plant on India's western coast. The 740 megawatt first phase of the facility began operating in 1999. The plant's generating capacity will triple to 2,184 mw when phase two is completed next month. MSEB agreed in 1995 to buy all the power produced by the plant, but now says the power is too expensive, and is refusing to take the additional second-phase capacity. Its change of mind has sparked concern over the fate of the project. DPC has already issued a notice of arbitration, and last month its board authorised management to terminate the contract. A vote on Thursday by lenders to the project is expected to endorse the board's decision, a source close to the matter told Reuters. 

Sinha said he had no comment on the vote. He also declined to reveal the Center's opinion of MSEB's refusal to buy the second-phase power. (Reuters)

Deshmukh convenes meet to discuss Dabhol crisis Sanjay Jog  
Mumbai, May 17: Maharashtra Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh has convened a crucial meeting on Saturday with state officials, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the advocate general and legal experts to take stock of the situation of the ongoing Dabhol crisis.
Mantralaya sources told The Financial Express that the issues relate to renegotiations with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) like the proposed arbitration proceedings, the Centre's reluctance to purchase Dabhol phase-II power, and issuance of preliminary termination notice to the DPC are likely to to come up prominently at the Saturday's meeting. Furthermore, the meeting would also discuss at length the DPC's refusal to pay rebate of Rs 401-crore charged by MSEB for the mis-declaration and default on the availability of power on January 28. MSEB will complete the review of rebate payment by end of this month and serve another rebate of Rs 400 crore to DPC.
MSEB and state energy department are likely to seek chief minister's intervention to take up the issue of despatch of Dabhol power from phase-II by the Centre in view of their inability to bear additional burden. In fact, the state energy department and MSEB were surprised over the recent statement by the union minister of power Suresh Prabhu that neither National Thermal Power Corporation nor Power Trading Corportion are in a position to purchase or trade Dabhol power to other states. 
Moreover, the energy department and MSEB were of the view that the Centre, which has provided a Counter Guarantee for Dabhol phase-I, cannot remain as a silent observer, but should bail out the state government and MSEB. The chief minister's meeting is also likely to discuss the ""cold"" response from the union ministries of power, finance and oil and petroleum in reaching at an acceptable solution. Ironically, the Centre, which has decided to adopt a conciliatory route, has yet to prepare a reply to the DPC's notice served on April 4 for the non-payment of December bill of Rs 102 crore.
Sources said that the state government would make a fresh appeal to the Centre to implement a common strategy in defending the stand of MSEB, Centre and state governments at the proposed arbitration proceedings.

'Affordable DPC tariff must to woo third-party buyers' 
The Centre should benchmark ""an affordable"" tariff of Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) liquified natural gas (LNG) based power, so as to enable the Central utilities like the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) or the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to buy and distribute power from the US energy major, according to a senior official of Maharashtra government.
""Now that DPC is ready for renegotiations, why does the Centre not set the terms of tariff for the multinational's LNG-based power?,"" the official said here today reacting to a statement made yesterday by Union power minister Suresh Prabhu that the Centre would allow sale of power to a ""willing buyer"" if DPC and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) jointly approach with a concrete proposal. 
The Union government is also a part of the Godbole panel and the former should not undermine its responsibility merely by stating that ""we would try and offer all the help"", the official said. When asked if DPC and MSEB would be able to find a ""willing party"" for the US energy major's costly power, the official said, DPC was ready to reduce the tariff and bring it down to an affordable level following which either NTPC or PTC could source it and pass on to the power-starved north Indian states. 
Last evening, Prabhu had said the Centre would give any status, including a mega project one, if MSEB and DPC approach the Centre for the same together. Prabhu had said that his ministry would extend its cooperation to the state government ""in every way"" to resolve the imbroglio between MSEB and DPC. The minister also categorically stated that NTPC could not buy DPC's power, as it was a mere ""power selling entity"". ""There was no question of NTPC buying power from the project since long-term power purchase agreements have been signed by NTPC with the buying states,"" he said.
Earlier in his meeting with state chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh, the latter had suggested that NTPC sell the excess power over and above the 300-400 mw needed for the state from the 740 mw Phase-I and soon to be commissioned Phase-II of 1,444 mw, to other needy states.

BUSINESS STANDARD Friday, May 18, 2001
BYSTANDER - Dangerous drift on Dabhol
The Central and state governments have failed to manage the Dabhol crisis effectively, writes John Elliott

No-one seems to be terribly concerned that Enron's $3 billion power project at Dabhol, which is India's most high profile foreign investment, looks as if it is heading rapidly into a meltdown. 
Even stories that Enron is shifting executives' families out of the country - surely the actions of an organisation that is clearing the decks for a showdown - attract relatively little attention. International lenders have suspended loans, and contractors on the Dabhol site are said to be withdrawing. This is no longer - as Suresh Prabhu, the power minister, has put it - merely the sort of ""dispute between a generator and a distributor"" that has happened in many other countries. 
Sure it started out as that; but it now looks as though Enron plans to take its recent force majeure notice to its logical conclusion and withdraw from India as soon as it can. One does not need a lawyer to realise that Maharashtra has unwittingly been helping Enron assemble evidence of force majeure ever since demands for renegotiation or cancellation of the project came from the state assembly's during its noisy sojourn in Nagpur last November. 
After that, the Maharashtra government stoked the flames by calling for cancellation and by demanding on three separate occasions that the plant should move from being idle to full production in three hours. That is a time limit that had never been demanded before and which the Dabhol equipment is not designed to meet. Then the Central government used this time-limit issue as an excuse for not paying Enron money that was due under the project's finance ministry counter guarantee. 
This must have confirmed Enron's belief that there is really no chance of it ever being allowed to settle down at Dabhol to a normal business relationship with the Maharashtra government, the state's political parties, and the state electricity board. There is too much history and baggage - starting with the original project's go-ahead against advice from the World Bank and others, and continuing with the way that Bal Thackeray was suddenly converted to the virtues of Dabhol's second 1,440MW phase stage after he met Rebecca Mark, a senior Enron executive. 
Then there were blockages on Enron's plans for broadband telecom and gas sales, followed by the Nagpur attacks, and damming statements issued since then by the Maharashtra government. Now the story is lost in a complex array of arbitration and conciliation, lenders' meetings, government meetings, and often contradictory newspaper reports. Seemingly forgotten is the basic fact that Enron's senior executive in India obtained authority last month from Dabhol's board to terminate the project if matters do not improve. 
For him not to act on that, India presumably needs to show good faith that it wants to resolve all the disputes quickly. But insisting, as the state government has done, that the interim report of the Godbole committee of inquiry on the dispute should be the starting point for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement is scarcely a conciliatory start. 
The best solution of course would be for Enron's 65 per cent stake in Dabhol to be bought out by a another power company which would then, with bankers and lenders, renegotiate the power purchase agreement, lower the rate of return, restructure $2 billion debt, and arrange to sell power across to states outside Maharashtra. 
Many foreign power companies have looked at the project, which looks attractive because the 2,144 MW power plant is almost completed, whereas most other big power projects have not even started construction, and because there is a large liquefied natural gas terminal which will be one of the first in the country. But no foreign company wants to pick up the risks and uncertainties involved. That leaves the possibility of an India buyer - with Reliance being frequently mentioned as the most likely candidate because of its proven financial and management capabilities and reach. 
But time is running out and it does not look as if Enron will wait much longer. If it does terminate the contract - and maybe puts the Dabhol company into bankruptcy - India's image will suffer because of the government's failure to pay the counter guarantees, which could well be presented as the central issue. The only beneficiary of this disaster would be the company that eventually picks up the pieces at Dabhol because it will obtain the project at a knockdown price. 
This may sound as if I am arguing that Enron is in the right. I am not. What I am arguing however is that the Central and state governments have failed to manage this crisis effectively. Instead they are treating it with a characteristic sense of drift - assuming no doubt that, like so many crises in this country, it will solve itself - which it will not. 
If anyone doubts Enron's motive for ridding itself of its India business, just look at its recent first quarter results: profits up 20 per cent to $406 million on sales that had almost quadrupled to $50 billion. Does anyone seriously think that Dabhol matters to such an international commodities trader?

Godbole panel not to seek replacements Our Regional Bureau in Mumbai
Chairman of the renegotiation committee appointed to hold discussions with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) Madhav Godbole, on Wednesday said the remaining six members on the committee were adequate to fruitfully continue negotiations with the power major. 
Responding to a query whether the withdrawal by three appointees on the committee -- EAS Sarma, RK Pachouri and Kirit Parikh -- would hamper negotiations with DPC considering their respective expertise in fields of finance and power, Godbole told Business Standard, ""I would not like to get into such an argument. As far as the committee is concerned we would not be seeking fresh inductions."" He was reacting to Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh's statement made earlier on Wednesday, wherein he said the government would wait for the chairman of the renegotiation committee to make a requisition for new members on the committee.
Deshmukh also told mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, ""We have repeatedly informed the centre of our inability to absorb the DPC power that would become available following the completion of phase II of the project."" He also observed that while Maharashtra was keen to ensure the active participation of individual members from the Union finance, energy and legal ministries for a fruitful dialogue process with DPC, the appointment of retired bureaucrat AV Gokak was not clear on some issues.
""Whether Gokak is authorised by the centre with some powers to negotiate on its behalf is not clear as of now. However, with renegotiations currently on, we would like to await the committee's deliberations,"" he said. The next meeting of the renegotiating committee with DPC is scheduled for May 23.

Shubh,

I spoke with Dan today on this issue.  As you and I discussed there are basically two CoU issues that you are pursuing.
A CoU for use at Dabhol.  As Dan suggested in the message below, the CoU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project would probably be a good starting point for the CoU to be used at Dabhol.  However it will need to be coordinated with the other project documents and the DPC/GSC C/P for Lakshmi and ultimately agreed by the P&I insurers for Lakshmi.
We (Enron) has also negotiated a 'short form' of CoU that has been used by Oman LNG for the ships loading Enron's spot cargoes loaded at their terminal.  As Dan has said, since OLNG drives their own CoU we waited until they proposed a CoU and we then negotiated to the final version.  Usually the purchaser waits until the seller presents the CoU and then they negotiate it.  However, we understand that MOL, acting for GSC, want to get this CoU checked off with their P&I insurers so they will have one less thing to do when the ship comes into service.  We could go to OLNG and request their CoU and send it to MOL for them to review with their legal advisers and their P&I.  Alternately we could request that OLNG use for the Lakshmi, the same CoU as we (Enron) have negotiated for the spot cargoes.  Not having been involved in the negotiations, I do not know how they differ or even if GSC will want to use the version used by Enron. 

Dan has said that with the complications now existing with ship lenders and the Dabhol PTN, he is snowed under and is not able to work on CoUs.  Philip Weems of King & Spalding (outside legal assistance) worked on both the MetGas and the Enron spot cargo documents as he has very valuable experience on these issues.  Dan has recommended that DPC use Philip but with the current situation, you may not want to get into additional legal fees or even start an exercise that may be totally in vain.
Please advise of your thoughts on the above.  I will phone you early tomorrow morning, Houston time.

Subject:	Dabhol India Conditions of Use

Attached please find a copy of the COU we negotiated with Malaysia LNG Tiga and Malaysia International Shipping Company in connection with the MetGas LNG SPA for the India gas pipeline project.  Please remember that this document is custom-tuned to match-up with the liability, risk and insurance allocation mechanism set out in the MetGas LNG SPA.  This document would probably be a good starting point for the COU to be used under the Oman LNG SPA and the AdGas LNG SPA; however it will need to be coordinated with those documents and ultimately agreed by Greenfield's Marine P&I insurers.   We used Philip Weems of King & Spalding for outside legal assistance on this document (he has very valuable experience on these issues and documents) and recommend for the sake of efficiency and cost savings that we do so on any Dabhol Port COU as well. 

Kind regards,
Dan

"Puzzle","
Gene,

I have a methodology that gives me the answer with 3 uses of the balance 50% of the time but requires 4 uses of the balance the other 50% of the time.
Are you sure this can be done???? 

For my first use of the scales, I place a total of 6 balls on the scales (3 on each side). If they balance, then none of the six balls on the scales is the odd ball. If they do not balance, then none of the six balls that were left off of the scales is the odd ball. Thus, I have reduced the possible suspects to 6 after one use of the scales.

Is this the right starting point???

Second, I place three balls that have been eliminated as suspects on one side of the scales and three balls that are still possibles on the other. Two outcomes:

1. If the scales do not balance, I know that one of the three suspects on the scales is the odd ball and I know whether it is heavier or lighter than the others. I can determine which is the odd ball on the third use of the scales by placing only one remaining suspect on each side of the scales. If they balance, then the suspect left off is the odd ball. If they do not balance, I know which one is odd because I already know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter.  

2. If the scales balance on my second use of the scales, then I have three remaining suspects (the balls left off the scales) but do not know whether the odd ball is heavier or lighter. I cannot figure out how to determine both the heavier/lighter question plus identify the odd ball in just one more use of the scales. I need two more uses. 

Am I close at all????


I hope that you had a good trip back. Stay in touch.

Paul

"Re: Next Cargo","If we worked out a price structure similar to the last cargo, we could eliminate the price risk by paying the following for the LPG:

1400 MT at a Fixed Price (represents amount borrowed that went to April sales)
2900 MT based on May Mont Belvieu plus Premium 1
2800 MT based on June Mont Belvieu plus Premium 2 and
2900 MT based on July Mont Belvieu plus Premium 3

The Fixed Price for 1400 MT and the Premiums 1,2, and 3 are under discussion with Suzanne. This structure matches the cost of product with ProCaribe's sales revenue.

Question: How does ProCaribe get paid for the 15 days of product that goes with the Progasco sale?

Subject:	Next Cargo

Our next cargo has a loading window in PDVSA on May 18, 2001, with an ETA in ProCaribe on May 19 - 21, 2001.  The cargo is for 10,000 Mts. (5.2MM gallons) at MB + 7 three days around bill of lading.  This means that the invoice will be the average price of MB on the loading day, the day before and the day after, excluding weekends and holidays, plus 7 cents a gallon.

The following are the monthly sales average per customer:

* Progasco		1,100,000 gallons
* San Juan Gas 	   210,000 gallons
* Centro Gas                  140,000 gallons

Total borrowing return to EcoEl?ctrica 3,200 Mts or 1,667,200 gallons on 5/19/01.
 
After returning all the borrowing (5/19/01) we have a balance of 3,480,233 gallons.  The following are the estimated sales and heater consumption per month:

* May (12 days)    563,520 gallons (from May 20th through May 31st)
* June (30 days)  1,408,800 gallons 
* July  (31 days)  1,455,760 gallons

Inventory balance as of: 7/31/01 (52,153 gallons).

Next cargo arrival delivery window July 20 - 31, 2001.

Scott,

See the attached document.

I do not propose any language at this time to cover the eventuality of Children (except for what is in the Will). Any changes that would be needed to my beneficiary designations for the two Brown & Company accounts and the Enron insurance benefits will simply be made as and when needed.

Thanks,

Paul

For your reference are the attached two files which have the write up from the two previous quarterly reports - Sep 30, 2000 and Dec 31, 2000.  I had given to Todd hard/paper copies of the same.

	 	 

I just found out that I might be leaving for Mumbai on Sunday for meetings beginning Tuesday, 10 April.  Hope to get back to Houston by the end of the week and be in the office on Monday 16 April.
