I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

"Addition of OXY point to Enron online","Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

Sacramento - Ten projects have been awarded grants totaling $2.3 million in the State's continuing effort to displace petroleum-based motor fuels in the transportation sector.

The California Energy Commission grants will help shoulder the cost of fueling stations for natural gas and propane-powered public fleets - including transit buses, trash haulers and medium-duty trucks. The total costs for all the projects amount to over $13 million. For every dollar of State funding, the participating agencies have earmarked an average of $5 each to achieve long term success in promoting alternatives to petroleum fuels. The Energy Commission's grant funding will also reduce the public agencies' alternative fuel cost by about $1.3 million over three years.

Grant winners under the Commission's Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program were: the City of Los Angeles, $250,000; City of Fresno, $250,000; City of Industry, through City of Industry Disposal Company, $196,427; City of Placentia, $225,000; City of Commerce, $250,000; County Sanitation District of Los Angeles, $250,000; the City of Temecula Rapid Transit Agency, County of Riverside, Rancho California Water District and CR&R Solid Waste Management through Downs Commercial Fueling, $250,000; The California Department of Transportation, San Luis Obispo County, California State University Channel Islands, California Polytechnic San Luis Obispo, Lucia Mar School District, City of Solvang and Santa Inez Transportation Company, through Delta Liquid Energy, $250,000; City of Colton, $250,000; and Southwest Transportation Agency in Riverdale, $150,000.

The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Program seeks to displace petroleum-based motor fuels and assist California in attaining health-based air quality standards. Top priority for the program is to deploy low-emission alternative fuel vehicles, especially for cities, counties, local educational agencies, State fleets and project participants of the Interstate Clean Transportation Corridor (ICTC).

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

  the project based on a thorough and independent review of the proposal
  in accordance with the Public Resources Code and California
  Environmental Quality Act.

  The staff has requested more information in the area of biological
  resources to complete its review. An addendum to the Staff Assessment
  analyzing the requested information and including the staff's
  recommendation on the project will be published after the January
  workshop detailed on page two.

  GWF Energy LLC is requesting approval to construct and operate the
  Tracy Peaker Project. The proposed location for the 169-megawatt,
  simple-cycle generation facility is a nine-acre, fenced site within a
  40-acre parcel in unincorporated San Joaquin County. The property is
  located six-tenths of a mile southeast of the Tracy Biomass plant and
  is bounded by the Delta-Mendota Canal to the southwest and the Union
  Pacific Railroad to the north.

  The Commission will hold Staff Assessment Workshops as follows:

        When:     Wednesday, January 9, 2002
                         5 p.m. - To last no later than 10 p.m.

                         Thursday, January 10, 2002
                         5 p.m. - To last no later than 10 p.m.

        Where:    Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] Energy Commission Starts Review of Riverside, Kings County	Power Projects","
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS RELEASE
FROM THE
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

------------------------------------------------------------------------



For immediate release: December 19, 2001
Contact: Chris Davis - 916-654-4989


Energy Commission Starts Review of
Riverside, Kings County Power Projects
Sacramento - The California Energy Commission today voted to start review of two new power projects proposed for Kings and Riverside Counties.

In two separate votes, the five-member Commission found power plant license applications complete and ready for the Energy Commission staff's comprehensive 12-month review process. The first application is from Duke Energy Avenal, LLC, for a 600-megawatt power plant in the City of Avenal, Kings County. The second is for Calpine's Inland Empire Energy Center, LLC's 670-megawatt project near Perris, in Riverside County.

Avenal Energy Project

The site for Duke's Avenal Energy Project is in the agricultural region of the southwest San Joaquin Valley. The project would be built on 25 acres just south of the Fresno County line, about two miles east of Interstate 5. The site is within the City of Avenal in an area zoned for industrial use. The land is currently irrigated agricultural, as is the surrounding property.

The proposed Avenal power plant project would be a combined-cycle generating plant consisting of two natural gas-fired turbines with heat-recovery steam generators and a General Electric steam turbine. The plant would use a wet cooling tower process, consuming approximately 2,250 acre-feet of water annually. The Kern County Water Agency would provide inland surface cooling water to the plant via the San Luis Canal. Local water would be used as a backup for the system. Electricity from the plant would be connected to the transmission grid through a 7,000-foot transmission line. Natural gas will be supplied to the project by a 7,000-foot, underground pipeline to the PG&E Kettleman Compressor Station.

The Avenal Energy Project will be considered under the Commission's 12-month review process. The Committee that will oversee the review is comprised of Energy Commission Chairman William Keese as Presiding Member, and Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) Moore as Associate Member.

Information about the Avenal Energy Project is available on the Energy Commission's website at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/avenal/


Inland Empire Energy Center

Inland Empire Energy Center, LLC, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Calpine Corporation. The proposed Inland Empire Energy Center project would be located on a 46-acre parcel in Romoland, six miles west of the City of Hemet. The project is expected to take two years to build at a cost of $325-$400 million.

The plant would consist of two natural gas-fired, combustion turbine generators with heat recovery steam generators, a steam turbine generator and state-of-the-art pollution control equipment. Natural gas would be delivered to the plant through a mile-long, 20-inch pipeline.

The Inland Empire Energy Center will also be considered under the Commission's 12-month process. Energy Commissioner Robert Pernell will serve as Presiding Member of the Committee reviewing the project. Commissioner Michal Moore will serve as Associate Member.

More information on the Inland Empire Energy Center is available on the Energy Commission website at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/inlandempire/


Public involvement is a very important part of the Energy Commission review process. To find out how to participate, call the Energy Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, at 916-654-4489, toll free at 800-822-6228, or by e-mail at: pao@energy.state.ca.us.

"El Paso Natural Gas Company Dockets RP00-336, RP01-484, RP01-486,	 RP00-139","Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached ""Motion of SRP for
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company"".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the current
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contracts
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision is
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has questions
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

"FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK","For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] Nearly 9 Million More Vehicles in California By 2020, Says	Energy Commission","
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS RELEASE
FROM THE
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

------------------------------------------------------------------------


For immediate release: December 19, 2001
Contact: Percy Della - 916-654-4989


Nearly 9 Million More Vehicles in California
By 2020, Says Energy Commission
Sacramento - By the year 2020, California is expected to be home to 45 million people and more than 31.5 million motor vehicles ? up substantially from the 35 million people driving 22.8 million vehicles in the State in 2000.

Californians, who used 14.2 billion gallons of gasoline a year in 2000, will consume as much as 19.6 billion gallons a year by 2020. Diesel demand will rise from 2.6 billion gallons a year in 2000, to 4.2 billion gallons a year in 2020.

These projections are part of a just-released staff report from the California Energy Commission entitled Base Case Forecast of California Transportation Energy Demand. The document, prepared by the Energy Commission for the State Legislature, describes the most likely outlook for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel consumption in the years 2010 and 2020 if present trends continue, with no improvement in fuel economy for cars and trucks.

The report, required by Assembly Bill 2076, is the first product in a joint project by the Energy Commission and the Air Resources Board to recommend strategies to the Governor and the Legislature on ways to cut petroleum dependence in California.

The Base Case Forecast documents the State's historical demand for transportation fuel. The study extends present energy trends 10 years and 20 years into the future and identifies key factors now emerging that could affect future demand for gasoline. It also produces an alternative scenario for the State's energy consumption, depending on the advancement of fuel efficiency in cars and trucks, and the acceptance in the marketplace of hybrid-electric vehicles.

Highlights of the report's findings include:

*	From 2000 to 2020, California's population will grow at about 1.4 percent a year. The number of miles traveled, however, will grow by 1.8 percent a year, meaning Californians will drive more and more miles each year.
*	Today's average per-mile-cost of gasoline is less than one-half of what it was in 1980. That's because, since 1980, the real cost of gasoline has dropped 40 percent while overall fuel economy has nearly doubled.
*	Fleet-average fuel economy, increasing since 1973, has leveled off. The trend is predicted to continue: between now and 2020, fuel economy will not improve significantly as consumers continue to purchase less-fuel-efficient vehicles like sport utility vehicles, vans and pickups. By 2020, such light trucks are expected to represent 44 percent of the vehicle fleet, up from 39 percent in 2000.
*	If more fuel-efficient vehicles - including ""hybrids"" - enter the marketplace in sufficient numbers, they could cut gasoline usage in California by approximately 500 million gallons in 2010, and more than 900 million gallons by 2020 under the alternative scenerio.
*	California will continue to be a major market for automobiles. In 2000 alone, Californians purchased 1,126,000 new cars and 965,000 new light trucks.


The new report, Base Case Forecast of California Transportation Energy Demand now is available on the Commission's Web Site at

www.energy.ca.gov/reports/


The Energy Commission, in conjunction with the Air Resources Board, will hold a one-day workshop on the preliminary results of the staff's analysis on Wednesday, January 16, 2002, beginning at 9:30 a.m. at the Energy Commission's offices in Sacramento.

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] Morro Bay Power Plant - Energy Commission Releases Second Part	of Morro Bay Power Plant Staff Analysis.","
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS RELEASE
FROM THE
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

------------------------------------------------------------------------


For immediate release: December 19, 2001
Contact: Mary Ann Costamagna - 916-654-4989


Energy Commission Releases Second Part of
Morro Bay Power Plant Staff Analysis
Sacramento - The second part of the Final Staff Assessment of the Morro Bay Modernization and Replacement Project is now available from the California Energy Commission. Both parts one and two can be viewed on the Energy Commission's website at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/morrobay/


Part two of the Morro Bay project Final Staff Assessment contains the Commission staff evaluation of the potential impacts on land use, cultural, soil and water resources. The analysis, required by the California Environmental Quality Act, is based on input from the public, local, state and federal agencies. The Final Staff Assessment does not represent a decision or proposed decision on the project.

Like part one, part two of the Final Staff Assessment makes no recommendation on the proposed project. In late January, Commission staff will release part three of the Final Staff Assessment. Part three will analyze the proposal's impact on biological resources, cooling tower options and project alternatives once staff receives necessary information from various, federal, state and local agencies. It will also contain staff's recommendation on the project.

Duke Energy, LLC filed an Application for Certification for the Morro Bay Modernization and Replacement Project with the California Energy Commission on October 23, 2000. The proposal would replace the existing 1,030-megawatt Morro Bay Power Plant units 1, 2, 3 and 4 with two, state-of-the-art, gas-fired, 600-megawatt, combined-cycle units, generating a total of 1,200 megawatts. Each new unit will consist of two gas-fired turbines and one steam turbine with two 145-foot-tall stacks. The total of four new stacks would replace the existing power plant's three stacks that are 450 feet tall.

Hearings giving the public and interested parties a chance to comment on part two of the Staff Assessment will be announced in the next few weeks.

Public participation is an important part of the Energy Commission's power plant certification process. People may get involved in a variety of ways. To find out how, contact the Energy Commission's Public Adviser, Roberta Mendonca, at 916-654-4489, toll free at 800-822-6228 or by e-mail at: pao@energy.state.ca.us .

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] News Release - Energy Commission Staff Completes Assessment of Henrietta Power Project","
------------------------------------------------------------------------

NEWS RELEASE
FROM THE
CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION

------------------------------------------------------------------------


For immediate release: DECEMBER 18, 2001
Media Contact: CHRIS DAVIS - 916-654-4989

Energy Commission Staff Completes
Assessment of Henrietta Power Project


Sacramento -- The California Energy Commission staff has
released its Staff Assessment outlining the conditions that
should apply to the design, construction, operation and
closure of the proposed Henrietta Peaker Power Plant if the
Commission approves the project. The Staff Assessment can be
viewed on the Energy Commission's website at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/henrietta/documents/


The document includes the Energy Commission staff's
comprehensive analyses of the 91.4-megawatt, simple-cycle
power plant proposed by GWF Energy, LLC. The facility is
planned for a seven-acre site near Lemoore in unincorporated
Kings County.

The project would consist of the power plant, a 70-kilovolt
switchyard, and approximately 550 feet of new transmission
line. Natural gas for the project will be delivered through
approximately 2.2 miles of new pipeline.

The Staff Assessment is a staff document, not a Commission
decision. This assessment was prepared by Commission staff
in accordance with the Public Resources Code and the
California Environmental Quality Act.

The Commission will hold a Prehearing Conference on Friday,
January 4, 2002, at the Energy Commission in Sacramento. If
the Committee determines that all potential issues are
uncontested, the Committee will convene an Evidentiary
Hearing immediately following the Prehearing Conference. If
any matter is contested, the Committee will hold an
Evidentiary Hearing on January 17, 2002.

The purpose of these open and publicly noticed meetings is
to allow members of the public to participate in the power
plant certification process. To find out how to get
involved, contact the Energy Commission's Public Adviser,
Roberta Mendonca, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800)
822-6228, or by e-mail at [pao@energy.state.ca.us].

"LADWP Gas Contract","
Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Contract.doc)

>B.C.S. Formula Works Just Fine
>
>December 11, 2001
>
>By JOE DRAPE
>
>
>
>
>The Bowl Championship Series ranking formula was designed
>to give something to everybody. The human polls are counted
>along with computer rankings, the strength of schedule is
>factored in, and teams are penalized for losses and
>credited for victories over better teams. As it has the
>past three years, the system worked. Can anyone honestly
>say undefeated Miami versus Nebraska (11-1) is not the best
>matchup for the national title game?
>
>Now Colorado Coach Gary Barnett and the Buffaloes' faithful
>are trying to say it is not.
>
>Yes, Colorado (10-2) beat the Cornhuskers handily and went
>on to win the Big 12 championship.
>
>The Buffaloes also lost two games, one to Fresno State, a
>fine team with a future pro quarterback in David Carr. But
>Fresno State did not even win the Western Athletic
>Conference title; Louisiana Tech did. The Bulldogs posted
>an 11-2 record by beating league teams like Tulsa, Southern
>Methodist, Nevada and San Jose State - a group that
>finished with a combined 11-34 record.
>
>The Buffaloes are beating their chests about holding off
>Texas, 39-37, in the conference championship game, but the
>Longhorns rolled over Colorado by 41-7 earlier in the
>season. One loss in a season when there are not two
>undefeated teams is understandable; rewarding two losses
>would be absurd.
>
>Colorado did not earn a trip to the Rose Bowl. If the
>Buffaloes beat Oregon in the Fiesta Bowl and Nebraska
>upends top-ranked Miami in the title game, shame on any
>voter in the Associated Press news media poll who decides
>that Colorado (11-2) is more deserving of the No. 1 ranking
>than Nebraska (12-1).
>
>Oregon (10-1), on the other hand, has a right to feel
>slighted. The Ducks can also be heartened that a
>Miami-lose, Oregon-win scenario might earn them the A.P.'s
>top ranking.
>
>The Ducks, who only lost to a very good 9-2 Stanford team,
>are ranked No. 2 in both the A.P. and USA Today/ESPN
>coaches polls. The strength-of-schedule and computer
>component of the B.C.S. formula did Oregon in. The won-lost
>records of opponents and opponents' opponents don't lie.
>For Oregon, those numbers add up to the nation's
>31st-toughest schedule compared to Nebraska's 14th-ranked
>schedule.
>
>Even if you dislike or don't understand the computer
>rankings, they account for only 25 percent of the B.C.S.
>formula. Oregon was ranked as high as No. 2 by one
>computer, and as low as No. 8 by another. Both were thrown
>out, as the formula requires, and the remaining six
>computer service rankings were averaged. Oregon's
>average-point total was 4.83, which means the computers
>rated it as the fourth- or fifth-best team in the nation.
>
>The math is essentially the short way of telling you what
>an hour of reviewing Oregon's season game recaps spell out:
>the Ducks struggled to beat decent but hardly great
>opponents.
>
>Six of their games were decided by 7 points or fewer. In
>four games, the margin was 3 or fewer. The Ducks had to
>persevere against Wisconsin (5-7), Southern California
>(6-5), U.C.L.A. (7-4) and Oregon State (5-6).
>
>Without the moral authority of the No. 2 ranking in the
>human polls, Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti and the Ducks' fans
>would assume the same gracious (and silent) posture as the
>coaches and partisans at Illinois and Maryland, both also
>10-1. They would celebrate their fine season at a
>high-profile bowl game, regret their single loss and admit
>that a down year in their respective conferences cost them
>a trip to the big game.
>
>And how about that moral authority? After Tennessee lost to
>Louisiana State last Saturday, the coaching colleagues of
>Nebraska's Frank Solich changed their votes in favor of
>Barnett and Colorado to try to keep the Cornhuskers out of
>the title game.
>
>Say what you want about computers and formulas, but doesn't
>it bother you that the human component of the B.C.S.
>formula is the only one that can willfully corrupt the
>integrity of the standing?
>
>Beyond Colorado and Oregon, the loudest whining is coming
>from the college playoff proponents, many of whom are A.P.
>poll voters. Fortunately, they too account for 25 percent
>of the B.C.S. standing.
>
>. . .
>
>So far, university presidents have emphatically shot down
>any playoff structure. Wisely, in my opinion. Would the
>last three weeks with losses by Nebraska to Colorado,
>Oklahoma to Oklahoma State, Texas to Colorado, Florida to
>Tennessee, and Tennessee to L.S.U. have been as urgent or
>dramatic if you knew many of these teams were going to tee
>it up again in a week or two and commence a round-robin?
>
>Of all the major sports, only college football offers a
>regular season that matters. Expanded playoffs in the pro
>sports and even the N.C.A.A. men's basketball tournament
>give fans cues when to pay attention. In college football,
>you pay attention from August on because the playoff is
>under way.
>
>The B.C.S. standing was created to ensure that the best two
>teams met in a title game, which wasn't always guaranteed.
>Tennessee-Florida State? Virginia Tech-Florida State?
>Oklahoma-Florida State? The past three B.C.S. title games
>resulted in an undisputed national champion.
>
>Cut through all the noise, and in Nebraska you'll find a
>team that won 11 straight by 10 points or more. Yes,
>Nebraska's loss was ugly and it came in the season finale,
>which pollsters, for some reason, have historically found
>abhorrent. Yet Nebraska has one fewer loss than Colorado
>and has faced better competition than Oregon.
>
>You may not like the B.C.S. formula, but it is fair.
>Whether you calculate by abacus or algorithms. Whether you
>argue it with barroom gusto or classroom decorum, the
>B.C.S. made the right game.

"[NEWSRELEASES-LIST] Commission Approves Energy Loans","The following News Release is also available online:

http://www.energy.ca.gov/releases/

*********************************************************

For immediate release: December 27, 2001
Contact: Percy Della - 916-654-4989


Low Interest Energy Loans
Approved for Three Agencies



Sacramento - The California Energy Commission has approved low-interest State loans of almost $2.6 million for energy efficiency projects in the East Bay Municipal Utility District, the Los Angeles Community College District and Humboldt County.

East Bay MUD, based in Oakland, will receive over $1.9 million in funds to install 12 60-kilowatt natural-gas fired microturbines at its Administration Center and a 30-kW photovoltaic (PV) system on the roof of its Operations Center.

The microturbines will trim the district's energy costs by over $431,000, based on new Pacific Gas and Electric rate schedule. The planned PV project has obtained a 50 percent PG&E rebate and will further reduce energy bills by $7500 a year. The projects will trim the district's on-peak and mid-peak energy use by 35 percent.

Simple payback period for the microturbine project is 5.6 years and 9 years for the PV system.

The LA Community College District has requested a loan for over $436,000 to install a 140-kW PV system at its East Los Angeles College. The college has recently made lighting and comfort system improvements but would like to produce renewable energy to reduce energy costs by about $48,000 annually. Reduced energy bills will enable the District to pay back the loan in nine years.

Humboldt officials will use about $130,000 in loans to improve heating and make lighting retrofits at the County courthouse and other buildings. Once done, the improvements will enable the county to reduce energy costs by at least $23,000 yearly. At the same time, the county will be able to reduce electrical consumption by 37 kilowatts. Savings from the projects alone will enable the county to repay the loan way ahead of the required 11-year payback period.

The loans were made under the Energy Conservation Assistance Act. To encourage energy efficiency, the act grants energy loans at a low 3 percent interest rate for local governments, schools from K-12, special districts, public and private care facilities, community college districts and other agencies.

"TWPL Imbalance","Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.
 
Ragards,

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

Detection + Prevention = Protection!

"RE: TWPL Imbalance","Stephanie,
 
Transwestern has been in discussions with ENA since very early December regarding the sale of the Enron Compression Services gas. The ECS off take is supposed to be 11,000 per day. The fact that ECS was not able to nominate their gas has been problematic for Transwestern in that it causes our line pack to be higher than it otherwise would be. When we began discussions, we were open to the idea of getting the full volume out of our system by the end of the month. If a nomination could have been made that resulted in a sale starting at the beginning of this week, ECS could have sold the entire 363,000 in December. At some point, it becomes unrealistic to expect to be able to do that. It has taken ECS so long to arrange for an agent that a now we are looking at selling the entire volume in just 12 days (~30,000/day).
 
I was expecting the following two things from ENA, 1) confirmation from you that ECS was set up to sell their gas, and 2) a start date for a sale with some advanced notice. I would then have conferred with operations to see if it would be possible to move the entire 363,000 in December. I did not expect ENA to arrange the sale before circling back with TW. If I had known that you were about to close a sale, I could have arranged to be pulled out of my meetings Tuesday afternoon.
 
I have advised Patti Sullivan that TW is able to deliver 25,000/d through the end of the month. The balance can be delivered in January.
 
I am confident that things will run smoother in the future.
 
Regards,
 
Paul

Greetings Paul:
 
Eric Boyt advised that TWPL was not in a position to deliver the full volume of approx. 363,000 mmbtu for the remainder of the month for the account of Enron Compression Services.  This would have been good information to know BEFORE we sold the gas.  I left a couple of messages today but never heard from you.  Unfortunately, we have sold this volume, at your repeated request, and are not in a position to retrade the deal. 
 
To the extent TWPL is unable to perform, please call Janie Tholt or Randy Gay to see if they can reduce the commited volume.
 
I am scheduled to be out tomorrow but may have to come in for the afternoon.
 
Please advise ASAP.
 
Ragards,
 
Stephanie
