Subject:	El Paso 1110

Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

Jane, Cal Hub has invoiced ENA $15,500.00 for August 2001.  However, I do not show anything in our system.  Do you know if this is valid and if so, do you know the Sitara number?  Thanks.

They are selling gas from Montebello.  

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Kern River Application for Kramer Junction Delivery Point

Kern River recently filed an application to construct the new Kramer Junction Delivery Point in San Bernardino County, CA as an alternative to the Wheeler Ridge Delivery Point.  Maximum design capacity is approx. 500 MMcf/d into the new Adelantro Lateral, planned by SoCal Gas, and existing and prospective expansion shippers have already contracted for approx. 328 MMcf/d of firm capacity.  SoCal Gas will reimburse Kern River for the cost of construction plus associated income taxes.  Kern River asks for approval within 30 days (by the end of November).

Any issues for ENA on this project that would require more than a plain intervention?   Are we one of the shippers?

Here is a link to the main part of the application:

1102017	c/p claims deal is for 8000 (rather than 5000) MMBTU for 10/31
1111318	c/p claims price is $2.47 (rather than $2.475) for 10/25
1133558	c/p claims price of $2.84 is incorrect

Subject:	California News -- State building natural gas reserve

FYI

State building natural gas reserve
Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts

California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis, forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state.

But in a repeat of the state's tactics when it lined up $43 billion in electricity contracts, officials won't say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future.

The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check, and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space, state officials said. But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases.

Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the state's goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources.

If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy, Hart said, they could rush in, scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state, he said.

Details of the state's gas deals will be made public as much as six months after they're signed, when they no longer give traders any advantage, he said.

That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates, who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of California's power needs for more than a decade.

""If there were a competitive bidding process, then, yes, the price should be secret while it's pending,"" said Marcel Hawiger, a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. ""But in a situation like it is now where they're just negotiating backroom deals, we think they should be disclosing everything right away.""

Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the state's foray into the natural gas market.

'A DISASTER'

""The governor's secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months,"" said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones. ""These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts.""

Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the state's long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California. His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt.

The state's new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state don't hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel, a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter.

Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts, if the power plants don't make low-cost deals for gas, the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself.

The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies, setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state, and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss, Hart said. If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option, the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state, he said.

Hart's agency signed a four-year, $2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm, Interstate Gas Services. The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California.


STRATEGY QUESTIONED
Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002.

Bill Marcus, a TURN energy consultant, said the state's high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases. Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, said state gas cost overestimates would add $300 million to consumers' bills statewide through 2002; about $140 million would be paid by PG&E customers.

Hart scoffed at PG&E's claims.

""For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous,"" Hart said. Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts, he said. But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future. ""You're going to see prices go up again.""

Mark Allen Bernstein, an analyst with RAND, said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter.

""We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations,"" he said.

The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month, water department officials said. It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California. The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins, Hart said.

Hart said critics of the state's electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong. By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas,

Hart said, the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring.

""We got totally hammered by the media for those (variable) contracts,"" Hart said. ""My God, we're saving billions of dollars.""

I ordered the pies for our big Thanksgiving day feast at Jeanies.  Wish

that one can. I know that Joan is not coming to dinner.  Should we
invite her to Christmas or wait for her to call.    If you ever talk to
her, you may want to mention that her father is still alive and lives in
the same house that she was raised in.  I hope she comes for Christmas.
If she doesn't, I doubt that I will ever invite to anything again.  But
that is that fucking Links ""better that everybody else""attitude.   I

Where:	EB4746

Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.

Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put ""junk"" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. 

We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.

Thanks,

Melinda

Here is the link to the spa.  I've booked the four of us in for a massage at 3 pm.  Let me know if you'd like to try something other than the massage.
See you soon,

"RE: Regulatory Meeting","no- the more the merrier.   Just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up..   By the way I talked on the QT to the Socal Gas trader and told him that I could not fathom that they would even consider 143 receipts points.  He said Rob Davis is clueless and currently is on a power trip.  They are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around.

Leslie and I work closely with Donna Fulton in our D.C. office.  I was talking to her yesterday evening after the meeting and told her how much we got out of it.  I think it would be very helpful to us all if she also participated by phone as often as she is able and she is willing to do so.  Would you have any problem with that?

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

Thanks

Subject:	Kern River Project

Kern River has filed for a certificate to build and operate a delivery lateral pipeline to serve the High Desert Power Project (Constellation Energy Group) generating plant near Victorville, CA.  It would be 31.6 miles of 24"" pipe with a design capacity of 282,000 Dth/d, and the fuel supplier for the plant (Victorville-Gas, LLC) has signed a binding precedent agreement for the full 282,000 Dth for a primary term of 21 years, with evergreen, at a negotiated rate.  The initial recourse rate is proposed to be $0.0583/dth.  Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for 7/1/03.  Interestingly, the notice states that the plant will initially require up to 141,000 dth/d to operate.  The rest of the capacity is to accommodate another plant at the site.

Do we need to intervene in this proceeding?  Any comments?  This is not a rush, but would like to know by Aug. 14th.

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Would you know, or do you know who would know, whether ENA serves any end use customers off of Southwest Gas's system in Nevada?  We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).

Subject:	Daily Update


Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Janie,

I regret that when you called yesterday you didn't feel that anyone outside of me knew what was going with your portfolio.  Let me reassure you that there are several that are part of the team that immerse themselves in the accounts that we manage.  Unfortunately, insurance products are held at the insurance company.  We have submitted the proper paperwork to change the broker dealer.  That has been done.  Now we're waiting for First Union to network the annuities into your account so we can see them daily.  We at anytime can call Venture and get values and allocations.  We also have your profile on a spreadsheet where we track your Venture piece, 401k, Accounts with us etc...
Let me give you the result of the Annuities;

2106218    Current market -$6,718.00  Grip value 12,617.  Currently in Cash

2016219  Current market - 52,187.00  Grip value
100,880.85.  Currently in Cash.

2235338  Current market- 204,005  Grip value
222,923.  Currently in cash.

2235337  Current market- 137,391  Grip value
160,636.  Currently in cash.

2235339  Current Market- 40,101  Grip value
44,584.  Currently in cash.

2235336  Current Market- 15,586.  Grip value
17,700.  Currently in Aim All CAP.

The grip value is the guaranteed value through annuitization.  You have a guaranteed growth rate of 6% on an annual basis, with a step up election if the market value has performed greater than 6%.  The markets were great in 98 and 99 with the first annuities that we made an invest in.  We stepped up the market performance and that is why the grip value is at the levels listed.  We are in the final stages of the annuities being networked into your accounts.  One has already shown up on the account.  The other 5 should follow through shortly.  I'll track it daily and keep you posted.  The important thing for you to know is the the positions are in cash, except Josephs (I spoke to him last night, he sure sounds like a fun guy) annuity.  Hope that this helps.

Where:	EB4746

Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.

Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put ""junk"" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. 

We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.

Thanks,

Melinda

Janie, thanks for forwarding.  After reading the list, it looks like she may
have intentionally left us off the list.  She probably thinks of us as part
of Pacific Gas & Electric, and may not realize we do not share views on this
subject.  I do see that she has Frank Lindh on the list.  Do you think you
should ask her if it is OK for you to include me?  Let me know what you
think.

Susan

"RE: Thanksgiving","will bring you back some cajun chef at Chistmas

Subject:	Re: Thanksgiving

I like to make my own chili.  I load it up with beans, Sue uses pork and
beans(it's O.K.), but I like the beans mom used to use.    I was told I needed
to put a little more kick into my chili, so I figured that I would ask the
best-JOE.

Hey, for Christmas, I will provide the Ham and all the beer,wine,pop,liquor,
pie,chips , nuts and bread. I will have Amy make some barbacued weiners. I will
need you to make double baked potatoes. I will have Jean bring the polish
sausage and corn/greenbeans.  I may get some sourerkraut and dumplins from
Stoysich also.  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham.
I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne.( I thought it was
pretty good)
Do we need anything else? We are all off on that day, so we can start the party
as early as 3P.M. or earlier if you think, my guess is that you will be at the
casino that morning. Please advise.

Elizabeth, this is a sell to Southwest Gas for 11/99.  In reconciling their account, SWG paid this deal at El Paso Non Bondad GDP and we show the deal at El Paso Permian Basin GDP.  Can you check on this for me?  Thanks.

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Gas Co. Asks to Recover Savings From Customers
Rates: Two-pronged request seeks to add more than $100 million to bills but offers to reduce that with PUC concessions like those that helped utility thrive. 
By TIM REITERMAN, Times Staff Writer
Rates for Southern California Gas Co. customers have fallen in recent months, but they will rise again under an unusual two-pronged request submitted to state regulators Friday.
The Gas Co. asked that its 5 million customers repay about half of a record $223 million in natural gas cost savings the utility achieved for them in the volatile market of the last year. The average increase would amount to $1.52 per month, or about 3% on a typical monthly bill of $46.
But the Gas Co. said it would reduce its request to about $30 million if the state Public Utilities Commission agrees to continue an incentive program that has brought the utility millions of dollars and to change the rules for how much of the windfall goes to the company and how much to consumers. That would drop the monthly increase to about 44 cents on a typical bill.
Although such rate increases may seem relatively modest, they follow a winter season in which bills rose sharply--and that made it admittedly awkward for the Gas Co. to seek tens of millions of dollars more from its own ratepayers.
""To claim a huge reward for good performance in a year when ratepayers are paying at record levels did not look good,"" said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, or TURN, a consumer watchdog group. ""I think it speaks to the company's sense of reality that they did not try to squeeze every last nickel out of ratepayers. . . . It could have been a big, ugly fight.""
While other gas and electric utilities have been battered by the natural gas market, the Gas Co. has thrived under a state incentive program that rewards utilities whenever they can purchase gas for less than market rates. By aggressively buying and selling, the Gas Co. managed savings in the last year that were almost 10 times the highest previous totals.
However, PUC officials raised questions about whether the Gas Co. should be entitled to its roughly 50-50 split with customers, which would amount to $106 million for the year ended in March. During recent negotiations, the company agreed to a compromise with the PUC's consumer protection arm and TURN.
'In for the Long Haul, Not the Quick Buck'
The Gas Co. now is willing to accept a smaller share of the savings for the last year--about 14%--and for future years.
""We're in this for the long haul, and not the quick buck,"" said Jim Harrigan, the company's director of gas acquisition. ""We want to see [the incentive program] continue in the future"" so it can benefit ratepayers and the company alike.
During a push for deregulation in the mid-1990s, the PUC created a program for the state's three major gas utilities--Southern California Gas, San Diego Gas & Electric and Pacific Gas & Electric--that was designed to give them added motivation to obtain the fuel at the best price for customers.
The program replaced contentious PUC reviews that determined whether the utilities bought gas at reasonable prices, and sometimes resulted in the companies having to pay back millions of dollars to customers.
By most accounts, the program achieved its goals at the Gas Co. During the first six years, the savings amounted to $75.7 million--$33.2 million of which went to the utility, and the rest to benefit customers.
But no one envisioned what would happen in the natural gas market over the last year, when prices along the California border skyrocketed. The Gas Co. used its purchasing power and storage and pipeline capacity to become a big player in the regional market.
In a trading room at its Los Angeles headquarters, the company conducts about 14,000 transactions a year, buying, selling, lending and trading gas. Last winter, when prices rocketed, one deal alone achieved savings of $70 million.
Harrigan said the company bought gas options in October and November.
""We looked at it as an insurance policy,"" he said. ""Those were bought at between $6.50 [per million British thermal units] and $8--and the price ran to $10."" Those prices allowed the Gas Co. to essentially apply the difference to the PUC's incentive program.
The PUC rules allow the Gas Co. to hedge to protect customers from price volatility, but they prohibit speculation in the marketplace. Harrigan said it is difficult to draw the distinction, but he added, ""We recognize when we are incurring risk, and have tight controls over it.""
The option purchases, he noted, were initiated by company Chairman Edwin A. Guiles and done in consultation with PUC officials. The options, he said, protected customers from December through March, when the Gas Co. achieved the lion's share of its $223 million in savings.
'I don't think . . . anyone anticipated savings this large,"" said Richard Myers, program supervisor at the PUC's Energy Division.
As the savings mounted through the winter and beyond, PUC officials reassessed the incentive program and questioned whether ratepayers should receive a larger share of the rewards. It was only fair, they reasoned, since customers pay for the pipeline capacity and other assets that allow the utility to beat the market.
On Friday, the Gas Co. filed a request with the PUC for its full share of the savings along with its proposed settlement with the agency's Office of Ratepayer Advocates and TURN. The agreement, which requires approval from the full commission, would divert more of the savings to customers.
Rather than the current 50-50 split, the proposed system would give the utility a maximum 25% of the savings.
""The sharing is not nearly as beneficial to the shareholders,"" said Anne Smith, the Gas Co.'s vice president for customer services and marketing. ""We would have loved to preserve the current [split], but in the interest of ratepayers, we think this is a good deal.""
Although the typical monthly winter bill for Gas Co. customers rose to $80 from $50 a year ago, the price has been dropping in recent months. June's gas cost of 52.1 cents per therm is about 26% over that of June 2000. But that is far lower than at San Diego Gas & Electric, which saw gas costs rise to $1.43 from 34 cents a year ago.
Executives of SDG&E, which like the Gas Co. is a unit of Sempra Energy, said they have no figures for their incentive program, which runs until July. Pacific Gas & Electric had no gas cost incentive savings this past year.
The Gas Co.'s large savings and aggressive trading have raised concerns that its activities may have driven market prices higher.
Although Florio of TURN praised the company for a job well done, he said, ""I think one of the reasons they settled is to avoid a big fight"" over whether its actions affected the market to the detriment of others.
""We could have spent three months and not come to a conclusion,"" he added.
Brian Cherry, PG&E's director of regulatory relations, said: ""Until we can see the details behind the transactions, we are not certain as to what impact, if any, they had on prices at the California border.""
Said Smith of the Gas Co.: ""We do firmly believe our actions did not cause prices to go up for other customers."" The market, she said, ""is almost like a race. Some came out better than others.""

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Hi ladies, just wanted to let you know of something that happened in our own 
area on the most terrible Tues. morning ever.  As people were dying in New 
York the manager and a female employee at our local IHOP pancake house on 
Hwy.6 @ 290 were clapping and celebrating.  The woman behind the cash 
register said ""I cant wait to go home and celebrate with my family."" 
This seems so hard to believe doesnt it?  My best friends neighbor was there 
and heard as did many others.  Many people walked out as did she.  She 
called the FBI and IHOP main office.   Not to mention have now heard the 
same story from someone else who was there at the same time. 
I am writting this to let you all know.  I will not give my American hard 
earned dollars to someone/anyone who would celebrate any American loss of 
life.   I would kindly request that all of you let friends and family know 
what went on at this restaurant.  When I first heard this it seemed so hard 
to believe, that anyone living and especially owning a business and 
benefiting from America would feel this way.   My best friend knows this 
woman well, this is not an internet hoax.   When I first heard the story I 
didn't know what to do, but as it is Sunday morning and I am picturing his 
restarant packed with Americans and him taking in all those dollars I have 
suddenly become inspired.   Not to mention when I first heard of this it 
seems so hard to beleive that anyone would feel this way you tend think 
""that just can't be true""  But it is!! 
Thanks.

I usually do not forward email to people that have provided me with their

received this email today and it made me really sad.  Even worse, my family
stop for  bite to eat there Friday night when Chili's was packed.  I
wondered why the restaurant was empty..

Anyway, please pass on if you can...

Subject:	Proposed Change in Gas Pricing Effective June 1

It is summer again and the gas pricing in place between Harbor and Enron no longer represents the market value of the product.  In talking to the gas desk, the new pricing we propose to be effective on June 1 will be:

Demand Charge of $.25/MMBtu times 16,000 MMBtu/d
Commodity Charge of Gas Daily Mid times usage.

I believe this pricing represents the bid in the market for service provided.  I will call you to discuss this important issue. 

Thanks for your help.

Chris

Subject:	FW: Oct. 2001 Price Discrepancies - MGI

I repriced the deals  and changed them in sitara

Ms Tholt,


There are two price discrepancies with the October 2001, EPNG sales to MGI Supply Ltd. First, deal number 1077216 has a rate of $1.705 on day 10/04. MGI claims the rate should be $1.80. Secondly, deal number 1093983 has a rate of $1.785 for day 10/10. MGI claims the rate should be $ 1.775. Sitara shows Jane Tholt as the trader for deal # 1077216. Can you please research and advise?

Thanks
[Riordan, Sean]

Subject:	Please Reply by Wednesday, 8/22 -- Draft Rehearing Request -- FERC Reporting Requirements for California Sales

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

Yes, it has been noticed.  Comments are due August 2.  The other complaint, RP01-486, by the Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona shippers has also been noticed and comments are due August 6.

I agree that we should intervene and support discontinuation of the FR contracts.  I would like to see us also support some proposed solution(s).  I think there is some merit to the Salt River Project ""conceptual"" solution -- up to the point where they call for continuing the current system seemingly until El Paso expands their system sufficiently to handle everybody's needs forever.  Some entitlement for FR shippers that recognizes the seasonal nature of their loads, which is how the system operates anyway, would be a reasonable solution.  Also, El Paso needs to at least make a nominal contribution to the solution by agreeing to some expansions to the general system.

I would recommend that when we intervene in RP01-484, the Joint Complaint against El Paso, that we side with the complainants against continuation of the FR contracts.  The gist of the complaint is that the full requirements contracts (East of California customers) on El Paso are creating capacity problems, as the loads these contracts serve keep growing, and cutting into El Paso's ability to serve the California customers.  My real problem is EES's inability to get firm primary rights into Arizona markets, which cost us millions in imbalance charges earlier this year.  Any thoughts?  Becky, has it been noticed yet?

Do you anticipate making these trades often?  If it will not be that frequent, just a notification (from you or Anne is fine) will do.  If they will be ongoing, it will probably be easier to have two separate entities set up.  My concern is the fact that they want to exclude this piece from our netting agreement.  Are you OK with that?

Janie,

On second thought, this may be a little more complicated.  So Cal wants to treat these trades as if they are a separate entity and they also do not want to include them with our monthly netout.  If this is going to happen on a go forward basis, maybe we need to get legal documentation from So Cal allowing us to setup two separate Global counterparties.  What do you think?

Thanks
Laurie

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

"RE: El Paso Data Request","let's ask for it by month.  In talking to Socal Gas, they suggested that we ask the question and explain why we are asking so that the FERC  staff understnads why.  Should we ask the question and then say that this information is needed to determine if actual supplies exist behind the proposed pools since the allocations are being made based on design capapcity and not actual gas.

Subject:	Western Natural Gas Organization

	
Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

From: 	Cantrell, Rebecca W.

To:	Miller, Stephanie; Tholt, Jane M.
Subject:	Kern River Project

Kern River has filed for a certificate to build and operate a delivery lateral pipeline to serve the High Desert Power Project (Constellation Energy Group) generating plant near Victorville, CA.  It would be 31.6 miles of 24"" pipe with a design capacity of 282,000 Dth/d, and the fuel supplier for the plant (Victorville-Gas, LLC) has signed a binding precedent agreement for the full 282,000 Dth for a primary term of 21 years, with evergreen, at a negotiated rate.  The initial recourse rate is proposed to be $0.0583/dth.  Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for 7/1/03.  Interestingly, the notice states that the plant will initially require up to 141,000 dth/d to operate.  The rest of the capacity is to accommodate another plant at the site.

Do we need to intervene in this proceeding?  Any comments?  This is not a rush, but would like to know by Aug. 14th.

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Hello.  I just wanted to tell some of my favorite people (to work with) that after today, Thursday, November 15th, I will no longer be part of the Regulatory Affairs Team.  I'm moving on to a different part of Enron, EES.  In fact, I officially start November 16th.

 I really enjoyed working with/and for you guys.  I've learned quite a bit from you all and I wanted to say Thanks.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

I would recommend that when we intervene in RP01-484, the Joint Complaint against El Paso, that we side with the complainants against continuation of the FR contracts.  The gist of the complaint is that the full requirements contracts (East of California customers) on El Paso are creating capacity problems, as the loads these contracts serve keep growing, and cutting into El Paso's ability to serve the California customers.  My real problem is EES's inability to get firm primary rights into Arizona markets, which cost us millions in imbalance charges earlier this year.  Any thoughts?  Becky, has it been noticed yet?

Energy Commission Report Projects
Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State



Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.

The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified ""yes"" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.

Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.

The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.

""This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future,"" said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.

To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.

Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

The just adopted Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report can be found on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

Subject: Comments On Technical Conference, RP00-336



Attached is a draft of Richardson Energy's comments on the technical conference in El Paso's Docket No. RP00-336. The comments must be filed on Monday  October 15, 2001.

 As discussed at the conference, Richardson's comments focus on opposition to El Paso's proposal to split its 6 existing pooling points into 20 points. From past discussions, we hope and anticipate that your company or client will be taking a similar position. In that regard, we are circulating these draft comments to facilitate the presentation of common positions by similarly situated parties. We hope this draft will be of help to you in preparing your comments.

Thank you.

Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy.  Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP.  Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?

Sorry about the flooding.  Hope you and your family survived ok.  Attached are the gas settlement and support for May.  The only difference we had was for package V02.  Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed, the price was Non-Bondad.

Have a great day.  Nancy

Daniel F. Collins, Esq.
El Paso Natural Gas Company
555 11th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C.  20004

Dear Mr. Collins:

RE:	Docket No. RP00-336-000

Pursuant to the procedures agreed to at the August 28 technical conference in the referenced proceeding, Enron North America Corp. submits the following informal data requests:

1.	Please specify the receipt points that are associated with each of the twenty pools that El Paso proposes to use for allocation of receipt point rights in this proceeding.
2.	For each of the specified receipt points, please provide on a monthly basis the average daily volume of gas that was scheduled for receipt into El Paso's system for each month from January 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001.

Subject:	PLEASE RESPOND BY NOON FRIDAY -- ENA Comments, NOPR on Intraday Recall Rights

Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.

insight into the firm's operations and analyzes its successes and failures.
For those firms dealing directly with Enron, or thinking about adopting some

Hi Jane,

According to my contact at Sierra Pacific/Nevada Power, the deals you're doing with them should be with Nevada Power , not Sierra Pacific.  For Sept, the deal #s I see are 737918, 796406,and 1043833.  Is there any reason why we can't change the counterparty name in Sitara to Nevada Power?

Sean, deal 1093464 is a sell to Southwest Gas for Oct-01 production.  On day 24, they show the price should be a fixed price of $2.64 (see email below).  However, we show 100% of ELPASO.SJNONBOND.GDP.  Can you please check on this for me and let me know your results?

Subject:	Update on the EPNG events of 9/11-13

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. We
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlement
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to ""what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity"". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

Energy Commission Approves
Metcalf Power Plant in San Jose


Sacramento - By a 5 to 0 vote, the California Energy Commission today gave the Metcalf Energy Center final approval for construction and operation. The natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant project, proposed by Calpine Corporation and Bechtel Enterprises, Inc., is expected to cost approximately $400 million and create 25 permanent jobs.
The 600-megawatt power plant is approved for a 20-acre site located in San Jose at the southern base of Tulare Hill in northern Coyote Valley. The plant's electrical output will supply the needs of 600,000 homes.
Calpine and Bechtel Enterprises are scheduled to begin construction on the project this October with commercial operation expected to serve the summer load of 2003. This merchant plant will sell power in California's electricity market.
On June 18, 2001, the Energy Commission's Metcalf Energy Center Committee, comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert Laurie, Presiding Member, and Commission Chairman William J. Keese, Second Member, recommended the power plant for full-Commission approval. The Presiding Member's Proposed Decision and its August 24, 2001, Revised Presiding Member's Proposed Decision on the Metcalf Power Plant may be accessed on the Commission's web site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/metcalf

The Committee's approval of the Metcalf Energy Center license came after a rigorous, two and a half year-long review process in which the Commission actively sought public input on the proposal. More than 50 public workshops, hearings and conferences were held on the project in which members of the public, 18 formal ""intervenors,"" other governmental agencies, and community groups participated in the Energy Commission's review process.
In its 480-page Revised Presiding Member's Proposed Decision, the Committee reviewed all aspects of the proposal, including environmental impacts, public health and safety, air quality, hazardous materials, and engineering alternatives. Based on evidence presented at formal hearing, the Committee recommended the project for certification under the Warren-Alquist Act and the California Environmental Quality Act.
In its vote to license the Metcalf project, the Energy Commission exercised its override authority, an important part of the State's statutory scheme for ensuring against power shortages in locations where power is needed for reliability. The Commissioners agreed with the staff that the need for the project and benefits it will bring to the San Jose area outweigh its lack of compliance with local ordinances.
The Energy Commission exercises its override authority cautiously, preferring in most cases to work with local agencies to achieve consensus with local jurisdictions; 1981 was the only other time the Commission exercised its override authority. In that case, the issue was a transmission line from the Geysers 16 project that the County of Sonoma contended violated its general plan. The Energy Commission's override was upheld in subsequent court action.
The power plants permitted by the Energy Commission since 1999 will boost California's power supply by 10,982 megawatts by summer 2003. Nine simple-cycle power plants licensed this year will add 683 megawatts to the grid by year's end.
The Commission's web site provides complete information about the review of California power plant proposals at:

O.K.....I talked to both Steve and Melissa; Melissa talked to Deborah Ortman (she cannot make it); I received an Email from Maria (she'll very likely NOT make it);  I found out Sherrie is at Cynergy in Cincinnati, so I'll give that one more try.

So, the ""final"" list for Friday is:

Deb and Bill
Melissa and Steve
Janie and husband (so sorry I cannot remember his name, Janie)
Neal
Nora and Maggie
Christie and Ed.

Bill, do you want to call Vallones and change the count to ""11""?  Let me know if you want me to do it.

By the way, Melissa completely agrees that the group we have coming, along with those invited but unable to attend, is THE list Deb would want included, so no need to expand the invitation list. Janie, agree?

I'll let you know if I reach Sherrie.

Best!

Hi!!   I left 2 messages for Deborah Ortman and her husband Ed Scott, but no word yet.  I think I have her eMail at my house--I'll get it during lunch and try her that way.     I have not heard from Maria, but I'm sure I will today.  Leslie wrote she's unlikely to be able to pull it together to be here. I have not been able to find a number for Sherrie Rutherford but am still trying.  Right now, it looks like:

	Deb and Bill
	Steve and Melissa
	Janie and husband
	Neil (no guest)
	Christie and Ed.

I think the original list of guests is her list of closest friends that she would enjoy sharing the night with.  This may sound odd, but I think she would really enjoy having the Maggie and Nora, Steve and Melissa's girls there--they are very very close and spend much weeekend time together..and they are a little older (13 and 14 i think)--I just mentioned it to Steve and he a said that would be great--I'll call Melissa.

Other than her family, (and though maybe a nice thought, may be too much of a surprise for her, and pretty extreme for us to pull together at the last minute), I think, with the addition of the girls, it will be a wonderful group of 11...and likely those who cannot attend will send a note or call, so evryone she'd want there, will be there, in one way or another.

I think a photographer would be great, for maybe an hour or so.

What do you and Janie think?

..Christie.

Yes, it has been noticed.  Comments are due August 2.  The other complaint, RP01-486, by the Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona shippers has also been noticed and comments are due August 6.

I agree that we should intervene and support discontinuation of the FR contracts.  I would like to see us also support some proposed solution(s).  I think there is some merit to the Salt River Project ""conceptual"" solution -- up to the point where they call for continuing the current system seemingly until El Paso expands their system sufficiently to handle everybody's needs forever.  Some entitlement for FR shippers that recognizes the seasonal nature of their loads, which is how the system operates anyway, would be a reasonable solution.  Also, El Paso needs to at least make a nominal contribution to the solution by agreeing to some expansions to the general system.

I would recommend that when we intervene in RP01-484, the Joint Complaint against El Paso, that we side with the complainants against continuation of the FR contracts.  The gist of the complaint is that the full requirements contracts (East of California customers) on El Paso are creating capacity problems, as the loads these contracts serve keep growing, and cutting into El Paso's ability to serve the California customers.  My real problem is EES's inability to get firm primary rights into Arizona markets, which cost us millions in imbalance charges earlier this year.  Any thoughts?  Becky, has it been noticed yet?

Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the ""NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS"" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as ""Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie"". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

Hey Janie,

     Don't worry, I have everything figured out.  Everyone is coming
over in shifts.
Barney wanted the two to three in the morning shift.  I think he'll be
home early
after a few non stop days of drinking.  If I hurt him bad enough maybe
he'll stop
the habbit.  I tried calling him on his mobil but it says it is no
longer in service.  I used
281-826-5246.  If he has a new number, E-mail it back to me.
     I was just thinking, I better call your Dad to see what shift he
wants.

Subject: good morning


I tried calling but noone picked up the phone.  Anyway, I just wanted to check and make sure you don't have any questions about running keystone and socal.  Generally, I put them out there initially with a 2 cent two way until the market gets moving a bit and then tighten keystone up to 1 or 1.5 cents.  All the products should be set to offset to last trade(usually a penny).  Then I just adjust the offset depending on how fast I think the market is moving.  The market tends to get really slow by 9:15, so by then, I'm back to a 2 cent two-way at keystone and a 3 cent two-way at the border.  These markets will still be tighter than ICE.  Also just a reminder, we have 8000 of the Waha gas to sell to the Texas desk.  All transport should be in position already.  Jason may talk to you about moving some of his transport out of Keystone, but not likely.  I would expect that we would probably want to go about 50,000 long for tuesday and then wednesday.  Check with Patti regarding the injection capacity since Socal raised it this weekend and there may be other changes to the schedule.  I'm available for any questions on my cell phone...832-444-7702. 
 
Have fun,
 
Mat

Subject:	Cook Inlet Purchase July 2001

Jane:
I received an invoice from Cook Inlet for July for three deals on EPNG that we do not have in the system.  My contact faxed me their confirmations and I have located two of the deals in Path Manager, but I cannot find the third.  The two that I can find are EOL deals on 7/31 that have not been pathed.  They are deal numbers 952730 and 952205.  The third deal was for 5,000/day from 7/28 - 7/30 at $4.70.  They show a trade date of 7/27.  I don't see this deal in the system at all.  My contact says that all of these deals were offset deals that should have been sold back to Cook Inlet.  He thinks that we billed him for part of the gas, but we have not paid for any of it.  Did we buy this gas from Cook Inlet?  Should it all be sold back to Cook Inlet?  I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks,
Megan

Importance:	High

Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached ""Motion of SRP for
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company"".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the current
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contracts
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision is
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has questions
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

Subject:	Breaking News : PG&E Suspends Open Season for 1.2 Bcf/d of Pipe Capacity 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Aug 15, 11:27 AM
PG&E Suspends Open Season for 1.2 Bcf/d of Pipe Capacity 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has announced that it has suspended its open season for additional intrastate pipeline capacity that was scheduled to close Aug. 30. The California utility said it made the decision not to go forward with the open season at this time while conducting a corporate wide review related to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. 
PG&E emphasized that the open season was being deferred, not canceled, and that shippers would have a minimum of 30 days to prepare bids for service when it resumed. 
""I don't want to say that we were premature in beginning the open season,"" said PG&E spokeswoman Christy Dennis, who noted that the company simply ""has pulled back for the moment"" due to the ""huge reorganization process"" related to the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shippers shouldn't view this as a ""huge red flag"" on the project. 
Dennis could not cite a specific date when the open season would resume, but she said ""it should be reinstituted within the next few months."" Shippers will be notified then, she noted. 
The utility first announced the open season in late May, saying that it planned to offer more than 1.2 Bcf/d of backbone capacity on the Redwood, Baja and Silverado paths on which gas from Malin, OR; Topock, AZ, and California in-state gas production is delivered to PG&E's local transmission system and other pipelines. Included in the open season was an anticipated 200 MMcf/d expansion of the Redwood path from Malin. 
The open season initially was to have closed on July 31, but PG&E extended it until Aug. 30. The utility, which currently transports more than 3 Bcf/d of gas in central and northern California, projected that the additional in-state pipeline capacity would be in service by Jan. 1, 2003, but the open season suspension could very well push back the date.

Comments are due by 6/11 on the FERC order proposing to reimpose price caps on short term capacity releases into the CA markets.  This is in response to the complaints filed by SDG&E and LADWP to deal with the high gas prices in CA and both parties requested this relief.  The attached first draft is the ENA/EES response to the FERC request for comments.  Please review and return comments, etc. to me and Becky so we can coordinate the changes.  And please forward to anyone I may have left out who should have been included above.

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Hi Jane,

According to my contact at Sierra Pacific/Nevada Power, the deals you're doing with them should be with Nevada Power , not Sierra Pacific.  For Sept, the deal #s I see are 737918, 796406,and 1043833.  Is there any reason why we can't change the counterparty name in Sitara to Nevada Power?

Subject:	Transwestern Negotiated Rate Deals

Thought you'd be interested in hearing that FERC is setting a hearing on the recent negotiated rate deals that TW did with Sempra, Richardson Products, Reliant, BP, and Astra to look into why those shippers entered into negotiated rate deals based on index prices that went as high as $28/dth when the recourse rate was 38 cents and why TW had capacity available for those deals when it didn't have any recourse capacity available.  This was a discussion item at the meeting today, and Commissioner Wood noted that some of these shippers were the same ones who may be having to refund their ""overcharges"" for electricity.

FERC also approved the rulemaking order on reporting requirements for California markets.  Apparently, the reporting requirement will be effective for 6 months, with probable extensions through 9/30/02, which is the term of the mitigation order for the electric market.  

Will forward a copy of the orders when we get them.

What time do you think we should start?  Don't forget to make enough double

Energy Commission Clock Starts
On Two New Power Plant Proposals


Sacramento - Two new power plant applications started the California Energy Commission approval process with unanimous votes today. Commissioners deemed the applications data adequate for the Magnolia Power Project in Burbank and the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility in North San Jose.
The 4-to-0 Commission vote finding the Magnolia Power Project data adequate means that the staff has enough information to begin the six-month licensing review. A unanimous vote also began the four-month licensing process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility.
Simple-cycle power plants that can be on-line by December 31, 2002 can be licensed under the four-month - fast track - process. The six-month process is for thermal power plants that will not cause significant adverse impacts to public health, the environment or transmission system. In both cases, projects must comply with local, state and federal laws, ordinances, regulations and standards, including the California Environmental Quality Act.
The Magnolia Power Project is a proposal from the Southern California Public Power Authority. The 250-megawatt, natural gas, combined-cycle electrical generating facility would be located at the site of the existing City of Burbank power plant. The city would operate the new plant that is intended to supply power as well to Anaheim, Colton, Glendale and Pasadena.

Magnolia is expected to cost $200 to $250 million. A workforce of approximately 320 craft and professional personnel is planned to build the facility. The proposed construction schedule would take 23 months, putting the plant on-line by the summer of 2004.
The Committee that will oversee the Magnolia Power Project review is comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert A. Laurie as Presiding Member and Commissioner Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Associate Member.
For more information on the project, check the California Energy Commission web site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/magnolia

The Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility is proposed by Calpine c* Power. The plant, planned for 15 acres in North San Jose at Highway 237 and Zanker Road, would produce 180 megawatts using four gas-fired, simple-cycle turbines. The project's key goals are providing a reliable source of electricity to the proposed U.S. Dataport facility scheduled for construction on an adjacent site and putting power on the grid to support South Bay energy needs.
Los Esteros is expected to cost $250 million. A crew of 287 will build the plant if licensed. Construction and testing are projected to be complete by summer 2002.
The Committee named this morning to oversee the review process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility consists of Energy Commission Chair William J. Keese as Presiding Member and Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) C. Moore, Ph.D., Associate Member. More information on Los Esteros is located on the Energy Commission web site at:
www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/losesteros

Public participation is a very important part of the Energy Commission approval process. To find out how you can get involved, call Roberta Mendonca, the Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800) 822-6228, or by e-mail at:pao@energy.state.ca.us

Leslie will be here next week (Tues & Wed).  She'll probably be getting in too late for lunch on Tuesday.  If you're here on Wednesday, I'll check and see if she would be available.  She usually gets scheduled up pretty heavy when she's here, but I haven't checked on her schedule for Wednesday.  I know she and I have a lot to go through.

Subject:	Harbor Cogen

Janie/Mike:

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Chris

"RE: California intrastate issues","At he El Paso technical conference , one of the FERC staff guys said that full requirements is dead.  There is an awfull lot of pressure being put on El Paso at the meeting to path their system.  The full requirements customers have to submit to El Paso 4 different load profiles-Becky has the details.  It sounds , though, that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding. However, that does not mean that any transport will open up to Arizona. The conference call was a nonevent.  I guess we are trying to find out how Socal calculates its WACOG.  So we want to put pressure on them to get details.  We want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow LDC to hedge and not be punished for it.

I was on vacation last week, and I just saw an email that you had a meeting/call on CA issues. Anything I need to know about?

Also, FYI, I am testifying thur. before the AZ Corp. Commission on Southwest Gas's miserable excuse for an open access transportation program.  One big problem is their full requirements contract and our inability to get firm primary rights to the AZ delivery points.  Are there any sensitivities on these issues from your side that I should know about?

O.K.....I talked to both Steve and Melissa; Melissa talked to Deborah Ortman (she cannot make it); I received an Email from Maria (she'll very likely NOT make it);  I found out Sherrie is at Cynergy in Cincinnati, so I'll give that one more try.

So, the ""final"" list for Friday is:

Deb and Bill
Melissa and Steve
Janie and husband (so sorry I cannot remember his name, Janie)
Neal
Nora and Maggie
Christie and Ed.

Bill, do you want to call Vallones and change the count to ""11""?  Let me know if you want me to do it.

By the way, Melissa completely agrees that the group we have coming, along with those invited but unable to attend, is THE list Deb would want included, so no need to expand the invitation list. Janie, agree?

I'll let you know if I reach Sherrie.

Best!

Importance:	High

Hi!!   I left 2 messages for Deborah Ortman and her husband Ed Scott, but no word yet.  I think I have her eMail at my house--I'll get it during lunch and try her that way.     I have not heard from Maria, but I'm sure I will today.  Leslie wrote she's unlikely to be able to pull it together to be here. I have not been able to find a number for Sherrie Rutherford but am still trying.  Right now, it looks like:

	Deb and Bill
	Steve and Melissa
	Janie and husband
	Neil (no guest)
	Christie and Ed.

I think the original list of guests is her list of closest friends that she would enjoy sharing the night with.  This may sound odd, but I think she would really enjoy having the Maggie and Nora, Steve and Melissa's girls there--they are very very close and spend much weeekend time together..and they are a little older (13 and 14 i think)--I just mentioned it to Steve and he a said that would be great--I'll call Melissa.

Other than her family, (and though maybe a nice thought, may be too much of a surprise for her, and pretty extreme for us to pull together at the last minute), I think, with the addition of the girls, it will be a wonderful group of 11...and likely those who cannot attend will send a note or call, so evryone she'd want there, will be there, in one way or another.

I think a photographer would be great, for maybe an hour or so.

What do you and Janie think?

..Christie.

Hey Janie,

     Don't worry, I have everything figured out.  Everyone is coming
over in shifts.
Barney wanted the two to three in the morning shift.  I think he'll be
home early
after a few non stop days of drinking.  If I hurt him bad enough maybe
he'll stop
the habbit.  I tried calling him on his mobil but it says it is no
longer in service.  I used
281-826-5246.  If he has a new number, E-mail it back to me.
     I was just thinking, I better call your Dad to see what shift he
wants.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's ""windows,"" it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Best,
Jeff

They are going to send out an e-mail to all parties requesting that anyone who wants to turn back capacity should so advise them and at that time select whether or not their identity should be disclosed.  The confidentiality of identity was the subject of our discussion yesterday, not whether or not we wanted to do it.

I like to make my own chili.  I load it up with beans, Sue uses pork and
beans(it's O.K.), but I like the beans mom used to use.    I was told I needed
to put a little more kick into my chili, so I figured that I would ask the
best-JOE.

Hey, for Christmas, I will provide the Ham and all the beer,wine,pop,liquor,
pie,chips , nuts and bread. I will have Amy make some barbacued weiners. I will
need you to make double baked potatoes. I will have Jean bring the polish
sausage and corn/greenbeans.  I may get some sourerkraut and dumplins from
Stoysich also.  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham.
I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne.( I thought it was
pretty good)
Do we need anything else? We are all off on that day, so we can start the party
as early as 3P.M. or earlier if you think, my guess is that you will be at the
casino that morning. Please advise.

"FW: Western Frontier Project","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Cantrell, Rebecca W.  
Sent:	Thursday, November 08, 2001 1:28 PM
To:	Miller, Stephanie; Tholt, Jane M.; Shively, Hunter S.; Lucci, Paul T.
Subject:	Western Frontier Project

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Jane:
I received an invoice from Cook Inlet for July for three deals on EPNG that we do not have in the system.  My contact faxed me their confirmations and I have located two of the deals in Path Manager, but I cannot find the third.  The two that I can find are EOL deals on 7/31 that have not been pathed.  They are deal numbers 952730 and 952205.  The third deal was for 5,000/day from 7/28 - 7/30 at $4.70.  They show a trade date of 7/27.  I don't see this deal in the system at all.  My contact says that all of these deals were offset deals that should have been sold back to Cook Inlet.  He thinks that we billed him for part of the gas, but we have not paid for any of it.  Did we buy this gas from Cook Inlet?  Should it all be sold back to Cook Inlet?  I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks,

 As I've done Normandy once before and have  good information, and as I've done Paris and London several times, if you guys want, I'll prepare a suggested itinery ,with associated costs, for the portion of the trip from London to Normandy to Paris;  then we can all look at it before making final plans.  Sound O.K.??

J'espere que vous avez un jour fantastique!!!  [I hope you have a great day!!]

Nous pouvons avoir dejeuner quelque jours avant pour parler le francais, d'accord??  [We can have some lunches or dinners to begin practicing French before our trip, O.K.?]

xoxo, Mme. Christie.

"RE: Harbor Cogen","Does the gas desk keep the demand charge?  Also, we need to discuss-if you forget tocall.   If you forget to call, the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated. Probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing.   Also, the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall.  If you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing,  your desk will be charged my cost.   Otherwise, I think it's a go.

Answering your 3 questions:

1.  You can imbalance trade 100% of it.  They are in your pool.

2.  Under the current structure, when we do not order gas, we buy it at that day's Gas Daily even if we forget to call.  This is bad for you guys.  Under the new structure, you only provide gas if we call.  

3.  The structure we have now gives us the option to elect prior to the month for a demand charge or as a variable adder against Gas Daily.  Would it work better to have a $.10 demand charge?  That might be workable.

I need to fish or cut bait on this deal by the end of this week as I will be on vacation next week and we will need to remove them from our SoCal pool if we do not want this deal.  So, let me know if the e new structure works for you given the answer to these questions.  Call me with any more questions.

Thanks

C

Can we imbalance trade this gas.  What happens when the cogen burns the gas without telling us like they have been doing.  Which desk keeps the 15000 demand charge?

Janie/Mike:

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Chris

Here is what came out of the west meeting today, at least as much as I can remember, and Janie has it all in her head anyway.

I will analyze the re-recall issue, so I need Becky and Steph to get me all the orders and contracts, etc.

We will argue for rationalization of the El Paso system, which entails turning back capacity before construction

We will file in the EP negotiated agreement case with Trachtabel to support indicated shippers (can I see what indicated shippers filed?).

6 pools, no linear pooling, etc.

anything else?

Becky, if I could I would like to meet with you and Janie Monday night at the hotel to discuss our strategy.  thanks.

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Subject:	SRP SETTLEMENT PROPOSAL - PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL FOR SETTLEM	ENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY
Importance:	High

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-486
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposal
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

The Rules of Bedroom Golf:
  1.. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one
club and two balls.

  2.. Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole.

  3.. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and
keep the balls out.

  4.. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course
owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.

  5.. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid
damage to the hole.

  6.. Object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the
owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being
denied permission to play again.

  7.. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon
arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire
course, paying special attention to well formed mounds and bunkers.

  8.. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or
are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners
have been known to damage a players equipment for this reason.

  9.. Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.

  10.. Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at all
times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course temporarily under
repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More
advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case.

  11.. Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled
particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time. Previous players
have been known to become irate if they discover someone else is playing
what they considered a private course.

  12.. The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any bushes,
which may reduce the visibility of the hole.

  13.. Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before
attempting to play the backside.

  14.. Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to
proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request.

  15.. It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to play
the same hole several times in one match.

Attached is a draft of Richardson Energy's comments on the technical conference in El Paso's Docket No. RP00-336. The comments must be filed on Monday  October 15, 2001.

 As discussed at the conference, Richardson's comments focus on opposition to El Paso's proposal to split its 6 existing pooling points into 20 points. From past discussions, we hope and anticipate that your company or client will be taking a similar position. In that regard, we are circulating these draft comments to facilitate the presentation of common positions by similarly situated parties. We hope this draft will be of help to you in preparing your comments.

Thank you.

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Just the simple things make him happy.  I am going to invite Pat and Judy over

I saw the tv advertisement last night for Temptation Island for Thursday.  I think it may conflict with Will and Grace.  Could be a tough night.

Good morning Janie, I hope things are going okay for you, I know this is a
trying time.  I needed to contact you and see if there is a remote chance
that Enron North America Corp. would try to transport gas under the NW New
Mexico Off-system Transportation Contract T30233???   I have some deposit
request letters in hand, but I was not going to sent them out until the dust
settled a little, unless this transaction for transportation is something
that you may do soon??  Please give me your best assessment of this
situation.  Thanks,

Janie,

On second thought, this may be a little more complicated.  So Cal wants to treat these trades as if they are a separate entity and they also do not want to include them with our monthly netout.  If this is going to happen on a go forward basis, maybe we need to get legal documentation from So Cal allowing us to setup two separate Global counterparties.  What do you think?

Thanks
Laurie

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

Thanks

That's a good idea, everybody likes salad and it would go good with sandwiches.
We could also make some bakes beans.  It would be like a barbacue/.  Ham
,polish sausage, macaroni salad and baked beans.  That wouild really make for
an interesting afternoon.  That will make sure Mrs. Alberg stays upstairs.

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)
