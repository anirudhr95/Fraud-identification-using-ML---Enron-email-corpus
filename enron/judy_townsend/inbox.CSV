"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.

"","Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement ""prior to April 1"" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more ""Transco-like"" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified ""why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days,"" said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that ""Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue."" But the commission went on to say that it ""may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading"" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that ""it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded.""

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to ""remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system,"" FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas ""has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided.""

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices ""may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637.""

The order went on to say that ""a less draconian measure"" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism ""that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price"" if it wanted to provide ""an incentive for shippers to remain in balance,"" FERC said.

Re:  LSS Fuel Retention Percentage

On September 13, 2001, the Commission accepted Dominion's 
uncontested settlement in Docket No. RP00-632, which 
resolves the issues raised in its September 30, 2001 TCRA 
filing.  Included in that settlement, among other things, is 
an increase to its Rate Schedule GSS fuel retention factor 
from 2.78% to 3.22%.  This increase results in a 0.29% 
increase in Transco's Rate Schedule LSS total fuel factor 
effective April 1, 2001.

"RE: Oct 10th Meeting of Natural Gas Reliability Advisory Group","Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, ""the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great"" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.


However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of "" Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?""  Dynegy seems to be saying ""no"".  KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably.  Another question comes from this as to our larger business.  That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ?  Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.

Thanks

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"TE Critical System Warning","November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance","November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

"Online Trading Simulation Feb 7th","Preparations are continuing for our simulation on Thursday, Feb. 7 from 9-11 am.

During the simulation, you will be able to use your normal, ""live"" Stack Manager User ID and password, which will be emailed to you separately.

The attached word document below provides a basic review on Accessing the Stack Manager.  You should manage the same products as you normally would, even if those products are not expected to be going live on our initial launch day. If you have products that need to be created, please contact Kevin Meredith (3-9555) or Chris Walker (3-7533) with UBSWenergy.com immediately.

Trading Goals - for all traders participating in the simulation.
Log into the stack manager on Wednesday afternoon and ensure that your products are ready to be activated on Thursday morning. We will send you a reminder on Wednesday to advise you of the time when the application will be available.
Start and end with a flat position
Make markets in your respective products
Maintain tight spreads in the products you manage

NON-UBS PERSONNEL WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE OR TRANSACT ON PRODUCTS DURING THE SIMULATION.

Internal Originators will be playing the roles of customers and will be hitting your stacks throughout the simulation.  You will also be able to trade book to book via the website with your website User ID and password which will also be emailed separately.

Market ""News"" events may be emailed to you at certain points throughout the simulation (e.g. ""storm in the gulf"").

Immediately after the simulation, the website will be inactivated, so that the operations group can test the mid/back-office systems, while the IT groups clean-up the transaction data from the simulation. 

The system will be made available again for live, internal trading (book to book) between traders on Friday, February 8, 2002. FRIDAY'S TRADES ARE FOR REAL.

If you can't log into any application on the day or are having trouble with your systems, please contact the UBSWenergy.com Help Desk immediately at 713.584.4444

Regards,
UBSWenergy.com

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index

FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

Hello all,

In an effort to make rate information more accessible, I have created Rate Cheatsheets for Transco, ANR and Transwestern.  The chestsheets include rates for basic Firm and Interruptible transportation service as well as fuel percentages, surcharges, cash out provisions and overrun information. 

More pipelines will be added in the near future.  Let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Thanks,

Jeff

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"Cross Bay Pipeline to New York City Gets FERC Nod","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Nov 7, 9:56 AM
Cross Bay Pipeline to New York City Gets FERC Nod 
FERC granted a final certificate to Cross Bay Pipeline Co. LLC of Houston to assume ownership of a 37-mile portion of Transcontinental Gas Pipeline's Lower New York Bay Extension and add 16,000 hp of compression in Middlesex County, NY, in order to boost gas deliveries into New York City by about 125,000 Dth/d. The Cross Bay project, first announced in January 1998, is estimated to cost $59.5 million. 
Once completed, the compressor station and pipeline would form a new interstate pipeline system that would extend from Middlesex County across the lower New York Bay, all the way to Nassau County, NY. The pipeline's capacity would be more than 600,000 Dth/d, with the additional 125,000 Dth/d of incremental capacity. 
""By expanding the capacity of these existing facilities, Cross Bay Pipeline Co. will be able to create an important gas transportation alternative for New Jersey and New York markets in an economical, efficient manner with minimal impact on the environment,"" project sponsors said in an earlier statement. 
Williams and Duke Energy each have a 37.5% ownership stake in the limited liability company, while KeySpan, which came on as a third partner in August 1998, owns 25% of Cross Bay (see Daily GPI, July 24, 2000 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20000724c.html>). 
Since its inception three years ago, the Cross Bay project has undergone some changes in size, cost and design. It originally was scheduled to go into operation in November 2000.

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"FW: Picture of RJ","Richard James Taylor was born on Jan 15th.  He weighed 7 lbs 11 ozs.  Jim would like to meet for lunch, HIS TREAT, one day.  Of course he doesn't want to meet me, he wants to see Judy P.  But the boy is smart, he knows that the best way to see Judy P. for lunch is to invite me.  See there, you are still a benefit to me.  So how about Thursday?

SNG LNG has made the necessary filing to place its FERC Gas Tariff into effect on the proposed in-service date of the Elba Island facilities, 12/1/01.   The filing (which is 311 pages) includes revised initial rates for terminaling service.  Most of the tariff was approved in the certificate proceeding.  Substantive changes are explained in Exhibit Z1, which is in Set 7 below.

These are links to the tariff pages.  The links will open in an imaging program.  Use Ctrl-Page Up and Ctrl-Page Down to move between pages.  If you want to print anything, use the printer icon on the tool bar above the page and select ""fit to page"" under the Imaging Options drop down menu.

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

"NGI:  Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates","First of the trade press reports???..

The FERC order has not been issued yet.

Subject:	Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Sep 26, 4:16 PM
Proposed Rule Extends Marketing Affiliate Regulations to All Affiliates 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioners Wednesday agreed to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking broadening the application of standards of conduct for transmission providers, including both natural gas pipelines and power lines, to require separation of the regulated monopolies from any other company affiliate. 
Previously, the rules simply required creation of a firewall, including separate operations in separate locations staffed by separate personnel, between gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates. The proposed rule would wall off both gas and electric transmission operations from any other affiliate, gas or electric, including financial affiliates. 
The Commission was presented with two options regarding the application of the proposed rule to electric transmission affiliates, which still in many cases have bundled operations. One option would enforce complete separation, while a second would have exempted employees who deal in sales or purchases of bundled retail native load. Staff and Commissioners Wood, William Massey and Nora Brownell appeared to favor walling off all affiliated personnel, so they would not be privy to market information about transmission operations that other non-affiliated competitors did not have access to. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, however, argued for exempting personnel dealing solely with retail native load. Breathitt said that while she supported the eventual separation of the entities, she was concerned about the timing. ""I see no compelling reason at this time; there have been no complaints and no evidence."" She said she thought state commissions might consider the move an infringement on their jurisdiction. ""I agree with concept philosophically, but I think there will be other opportunities later on, after we do a little more bridge-building with state commissions."" 
Wood said he understood ""the political issue here with respect to federal-state relations, but I think this is an opportunity for discrimination that ought to be eliminated."" Staff pointed out that if there were any problems with transmission reliability or if some small utilities had problems, waivers could be granted. Staff was questioned by the commissioners as to how much information was available to affiliate personnel. ""If I am an affiliate employee dealing solely with retail native load, I can go into the control room and get all the information I want,"" one staffer responded. 
Wood proposed, and the commissioners ratified, a proposed rule with no exceptions, but which makes clear that in the final rule the Commission may reverse field and determine that separation of employees dealing with sales of native load is not required. Commenting parties should provide cost/benefit analysis on both sides of the question. State commissions are also invited to comment. Wood had suggested the Commission extend the separation to all sales employees, ""but make it clear that if we don't hear from people that they really want this separation, we ain't going to do it.""

December 19, 2001

Notice to: All Producers, Receipt Point Operators, 
Interconnecting Pipelines and Shippers on the Transcontinental 
Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) System

 Subject: Gas Merchantability Reminder

Transco has been receiving gas with a slightly higher heating 
content (btu/cf) in its mainline over the past week and feels 
this is the result of processing plants scaling back their 
operations due to poor economics. Transco reminds Producers and 
Shippers on its system to ensure that processing arrangements 
are in place and that the gas received by Transco meets its 
merchantability requirements. 

These gas merchantability specifications are outlined in 
Transco's gas merchantability notice, most recently re-posted 
July 27, 2001. 

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact 
the following at Transco: Ron Doyle, 713-215-2921 or Terry 
Fitch, 713-215- 3361.

Re: TETCO Electric Power Cost Adjustment Effective 02/01/02

On December 27, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP02-131 to 
reflect its Electric Power Cost Adjustment.  Included in the 
filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate Schedule X-28 which 
Transco uses to render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The 
revised rates have a proposed effective date of February 1, 2002, 
and if accepted as proposed would result in the following changes 
in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates: 

Demand Rate - $0.0270 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0021 increase
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0008 increase

Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department, at

To:  All Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Customers, Shippers,

Transit on the Web is upgrading its mainframe operating system.
Customers, who have not done so already, will need to upgrade 
their version of QWS3270 from 16-bit to 32-bit.  QWS3270 is the 
tool used for Confirmation Ranking, ONE Contracting and Capacity 
Release.

We are asking that all of our Transit customers upgrade to 
the 32-bit version by February 7, 2002.  The Transit Home Page 
contains a link with directions to determine your version (16-bit 
or 32-bit). It also contains necessary information to upgrade if 
needed.

If the upgrade is not completed by February 7, 2002, customers may 
not be able to access Confirmation Ranking, ONE Contracting and 
Capacity Release.

If you have any questions or if you are a customer using Windows 
NT, please call the Transit Help line.

Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                                 
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its 
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the 
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine 
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the 
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission 
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous 
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and 
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure 
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update 
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that 
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the 
specified dates. 

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia 
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start 
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and 
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments 
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for 
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

"FW: Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production","All,  A fix to prevent the occurrence of deals not bridging to Sitara from EOL when deal start and end dates were not entered on EOL has been installed and tested.THANKS

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV","Monday February 4, 9:07 am Eastern Time 
Press Release
SOURCE: Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. 
Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV Expansion Of Natural Gas Pipeline System
BOSTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to further expand its natural gas pipeline system. The $250 million expansion project, designated Phase IV, will allow Maritimes to nearly double its capacity to transport natural gas from offshore Nova Scotia to markets in the northeastern United States from approximately 415,000 dekatherms to 800,000 dekatherms per day. 
Demand for natural gas, especially in New England and the Northeast, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Maritimes received substantial requests for transportation services from local natural gas distribution companies, natural gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers during a recently completed open season nominations period, emphasizing the market's desire for more natural gas from Atlantic Canada. 
``The demand for natural gas is real, and it is significant,'' said Tom O'Connor, president of M&N Management Co., the managing member of Maritimes. ``Maritimes is able to respond to the demand by efficiently and economically expanding its system to deliver new supplies of gas from fields off Canada's east coast. Access to additional sources of this cleaner-burning fuel will ensure greater energy reliability and flexibility for the northeast region.'' 
Earlier this year, Maritimes signed agreements with PanCanadian Energy Services Inc. to transport up to approximately 400 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. The Phase IV expansion project will accommodate the increased volumes of gas. 
The Phase IV expansion complements the planned extension of the Maritimes pipeline from Methuen to Beverly, Mass. The extension -- Phase III of the Maritimes project -- will interconnect the 650-mile Maritimes pipeline with Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s 1,000-mile system through Algonquin's proposed HubLine project. The Maritimes Phase III and Algonquin HubLine projects recently received final approval from FERC. 
The Phase IV project proposes to construct four compressor stations in Maine each with approximately 26,800 horsepower of additional compression and approximately 31.3 miles of additional pipeline loop facilities in Maine's Washington County. The new compressor stations are proposed to be located in the municipalities of Eliot, Gorham, Brewer and Searsmont. Maritimes recently held open houses in these communities to provide information on the proposed expansion. 
``We will work closely with federal, state and municipal officials as well as landowners and stakeholders throughout the FERC process to ensure the project is designed and constructed with minimal impact to communities and the environment,'' said Bill Penney, senior vice president and general manager of Maritimes. ``As we proceed with the Phase IV expansion, Maritimes will continue its solid record of environmental, safety and operational compliance.'' 
In addition to the FERC application, Maritimes will submit applications to other appropriate federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Coastal Zone Management and Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The Phase IV expansion is expected to be in service in 2004. 
Maritimes is owned by affiliates of Duke Energy (37.5 percent); Westcoast Energy, Inc. (37.5 percent); ExxonMobil (12.5 percent); and Emera Inc. (12.5 percent). For more information, contact Maritimes on the Internet at www.mnp-usa.com <http://www.mnp-usa.com>.

"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International

?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.

"FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Access Card Information","
Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155 higher
Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for continued
cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest had locals
scurrying to cover their short positions. The March contract gained $0.123
to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying started early in the session, a
reaction in part to Thursday's liquidation on the January contract
expiration. Clearing the books of Enron-related hedging losers in time for
year-end could also be playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the
volatility over the past month has been triggered by larger books
balancing their hedges. Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to
recontract supplies, pushing the market with offers or with bids.
Shuffling monthly spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought
at higher prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop
mid-January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals. The
AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data until
Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this winter, many
traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this week. Natural gas
for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.10
higher Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained
$0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have began
flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven this year by
the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this year's filings to try
to make sure other companies don't go the same way as Enron. What is new
this year is the auditor independence proposals. Pension funds affiliated
with the United Brotherhood of Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals
calling on companies not to hire the same accounting firm to do both audit
and non-audit work. Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both
audit and non-audit services, a dual relationship that has raised
questions about Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual
flood that hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be
included in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In 2001 the
SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to exclude
shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle charges
that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before the state
opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at offsetting
expenses for building generating plants and related regulatory financing
plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas prices soared a year ago, the
PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas utilities had no stranded costs
related to generating assets because of the large amount of natural gas
fired generation in the state. Climbing prices made natural gas fired
plants almost as costly to operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is
approved by the PUC, TXU will return $350 million to retail electric
suppliers over 2 years by providing credits on transmission and
distribution rates. TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million
in the 4th quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would
eliminate any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak
nuclear station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to the
utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements approved by
the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to $90 per customer
from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains more than 60% of its
customers after the first 2 years of competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity

    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind facility in
Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain Windpower. The
project will include about 42 wind turbines, each producing about 1.5 MW.
The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest wind turbine technology and
will be the largest commercial wind energy facility in the eastern US. The
project is expected to be operational by December 2002. It will
interconnect with the Allegheny Power System in the PJM West RTO and will
be integrated with the PJM RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed
20-year purchase agreements for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project,
15 MW from the Mill Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain
Wind Farm near Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio
to 144 MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community Energy
and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind projects. Large
commercial customers, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie
Mellon University, Penn State University, Philadelphia Suburban Water
Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have already purchased wind energy from
Power Team and Community Energy for periods from 15 years. Power Team's
current renewable supply portfolio includes wind, landfill gas,
hydroelectric, and biomass generation.

FERC Order Sets Direction in Midwest

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the vehicle for
a single, regional transmission organization in the Midwest is an
important decision.  It will spark the development of a competitive
regional power market in the Midwest, of particular importance to
energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a customer coalition
active in the federal arena. The Coalition of Midwest Transmission
Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio, stated that FERC's
decision paves the way for actual implementation of plans to get a truly
independent entity for the Midwest transmission grid, that encompasses
twenty states and Manitoba, Canada, up and running. The coordination so
critical to system reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now
proceed on a timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition
of problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue with
development at a challenging pace since an effective regional marketplace
will benefit not only residential users but also Midwestern businesses in
their efforts to thrive in the worldwide marketplace. The FERC Order also
found that creation of the Alliance RTO does not satisfy scope and
configuration requirements spelled out in FERC's Order 2000. The
Commission made plain that the Alliance companies could continue with the
formation of the for-profit Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella.
The significance of this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance
of a single organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of
market participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and competitive
marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November 20th orders
preventing several utilities from using their market-pricing authority in
areas where they have market power is as critical to nurturing an
effective market as the order for a single Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from Whitehorse,
Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural gas drilling. By
utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its reverse circulation
center sampling technology to shallow low-pressure gas drilling, the
resulting formation damage is virtually eliminated. The air circulates
down between the inner and outer drill pipe, drives the air hammer, and
reverse circulates the rock cuttings back up to surface. This virtually
eliminates drilling damage to the formation.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER","To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance.

"American Heart Walk","Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

"RE: Undeliverable: Glad to hear from you","
Hi! Glad to hear you are all doing fine. Mom is good. I am still on the northwest side of town. I bought a house last summer, which I am now trying to sell. It is a three bedroom and since James and I got married it is too small. I don't know if I mentioned it, or if Ingrid did, but he has three boys. So, we have found a 5 bedroom house in the same neighborhood, Prestonwood Forest, that we will probably buy, we just have to sell ours. Mom also bought a house in the same neighborhood last summer. She moved my Granny here from Port Arthur to live with her. She is 95. I think Mom is going to go crazy dealing with her. Mother doesn't have much patience. Let me know when you can go to lunch. I would really like to see you.
See you soon, 
Laurie

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"AGT Capacity for length restricted","November 7, 2001

Extended weather forecasts portend low demand conditions for the next
week to ten days.  Currently, Algonquin Gas Transmission (AGT) is facing
high line pack levels.  Thus the pipe has severely restricted
ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately, AGT is
requesting that all shippers ensure that physical receipts do not
exceed physical deliveries. Receipt operators are expected to not flow
above scheduled volumes.  Delivery meters are expected to take all gas
scheduled.  Any customer who is long should take immediate action to
resolve due-shipper positions.

No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled, and OBA parties should
ensure that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper
makeup gas may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.
These restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Subject:	Reliant Entex-Tennessee Pipeline

Received a phone call on Thursday, December 13th approx. 9:15am from Royal Edmondson, Gas Control Manager for Reliant Entex.  He was trying to locate Victoria Versen and was eventually  transferred to me.  He wanted to make sure Enron was delivering gas to the Entex's city gates.  He asked if  Enron was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gates were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tennessee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility that the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city gates were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was automatically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what the storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the storage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on that matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome with Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered.  

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.   

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provide too much information without knowing his full intentions.



Thanks,

"Summary of Entitlements - Revised  (Disregard Previous E-mail)","Jay, this spreadsheet has a summary of the exit and operational entitlements that TETCO has provided Enron that Yankee granted. Assuming that you do not wish to modify the two smaller release offers (#19996 and #19997), I have provided you exactly what needs to be done to modify the larger release offer (#19998).

It is important that the releases grant us the minimal exit entitlements by production zone to M1 as well as M1 to M3 /M1 to M2 as noted in ""Exhibit A"". I will be working in NY on Monday. However, Judy Townsend and Ruth Concannon are familiar with this deal structure. Judy is most familiar with the current issues. I will be visiting with Ruth early on Monday.  In the meantime, Judy can answer any questions. Judy tends to be busy trading until 11:00  AM CST.  She may not be able to spend as much time with you in the morning. However, Ruth will be able to assist if Judy is busy.

I will give you a call from the road around 9:00 AM.

We will get this done together...Thanks!!!

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

"Update to Bus Pass Information","
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"How are you?","
Hi Judy, 
How are you? I sent Ingrid an email and she told me that you are still at Enron. That's good. I tried to call you at work, but the girl that answered the phone said that you were on vacation today.
How are the kids and Rob? I think about you all of the time. Ingrid told me that she told you that I got married. It isn't Tod, it is James Johnson that I dated in high school. We could have saved each other a lot of heart ache and just stayed together. He is really sweet. He has 3 boys, so now there are 4 boys in my house. I am real outnumbered! But, it's fun. 
Are you still working part-time or full-time? There is so much to talk about, we need to get together for lunch or something. Maybe we could meet somewhere one day, let me know. My phone numbers are Home: 281-807-3186 and work 713-215-4473. And now, you have my email address. 
Talk to you soon, 
Laurie

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Quiet Trading

    Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043 to $2.074
per MMBtu yesterday. The April contract lost $0.032 to $2.152 per MMBtu.
The market dipped lower soon after opening higher and spent most of the
session between $2.10 - $2.12, but fell off sharply near the close as
locals sold down the contract to the $2.07 support level and went home
short. The AGA will release this week's storage report this afternoon, and
while some traders are predicting a very bearish less than 100 Bcf
withdrawal, look for the number to be closer to 120 Bcf. Cold weather in
the Midwest and Texas, the growing differential between cash and futures,
and the perceived premium in the early March contract have kept the market
from dropping further. Physical prices retained their premium over futures
yesterday on short-term cold weather at some pipelines, maintaining about
a $0.07 - $0.10 premium over the NYMEX. But cash traders expect the demand
to ease quickly as temperatures moderate by this weekend. As usual, the
market will look to the weekly storage report for short term direction,
but it is the massive amount of volumes still in storage compared to last
year that has put a cap on longer term price increases. Natural gas for
next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to plus or
minus a few cents yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the
Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.20 per MMBtu.

Enron Executives Knew of Losses


    Enron's top executives and board of directors knew as early as March
that its off the books partnerships were losing money, according to
William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law School who was
appointed Enron's board of directors to investigate the company. In
testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Powers said that
Enron had a $500 million loss in March. Rather than report it to
shareholders, Enron gave a partnership called Raptor another $800 million
in Enron shares. He said that there is no doubt that almost everyone, from
the board of directors on down, knew that the company was attempting to
offset investment losses with stock. The partnerships allowed Enron to
misrepresent earnings for a period spanning the 3rd quarter of 2000
through the 3rd quarter of 2001 by $1 billion. Powers told that committee
that over 70% of Enron's earnings for that period were false. He said that
there were red flags that should have alerted former chairman Ken Lay to
what was happening. Powers says that Lay definitely understood that Enron
was using its own stock to offset the losses in the partnerships.

Reliant Shares Plunge after Delay of 4th Quarter Results


    Reliant Resources' stock plunged more than 13% yesterday, dropping to
a 52-week low after it delayed 4th quarter earnings and said it will
restate earnings for the 2nd and 3rd quarters of 2001 to reflect
additional profits of $100 - $130 million. However, it lowered its
earnings guidance for 2002. Reliant Resources is 80% owned by Reliant
Energy, which also delayed its 4th quarter report. Shares of Reliant
Energy dropped $1.98, or 8%, to $22.94. Reliant Resources said it will
restate earnings due to a reclassification of purchases and sales of
natural gas and power that were originally intended to be cash flow
hedges, but said it now believes the transactions did not meet all of the
necessary criteria for hedge accounting. Reliant's accounting department
discovered the error as it was preparing the year-end statement and
brought it to the attention of outside auditors and the audit committees
of both Reliant boards. As a result of the reclassification, Reliant will
recognize in 2001 earnings that which it had expected to recognize in 2002
and 2003, resulting in the lowered earnings estimate. The move will not
affect cash flow for any period. Reliant now expects earnings in 2002 of
$1.80 - $2.00 per share, below previous estimates of $2.05 - $2.15 to
reflect weak economic conditions and steps taken to strengthen its balance
sheet. Moody's and S&P both said that the announcements would not have any
impact on the credit rating of Reliant Resources, which was placed on
credit watch after Reliant said it planned to buy Orion Power Holdings for
$2.9 billion. The deal also involves assumption of $2.1 billion in debt
which could cause problems in today's post-Enron environment. Reliant has
lowered its capital spending budget for 2002 to 2006 by $1.6 billion to
further strengthen its balance sheet.

Europeans Trade Enron Debt to Limit Exposure


   Enron's European creditors are scrambling to cut their losses of
billions of dollars to trading partners and banks across the continent. UK
energy companies are pairing off debts and credits, owed to and by Enron,
as they look to limit the losses. Exposures have been exacerbated in some
cases by the invalidity of bank guarantees given by the group just before
it failed in November. Debt trading could reduce by millions of dollars
the amount of money Enron Europe's bankruptcy administrators
PricewaterhouseCoopers can recover as companies try to limit their
exposure to the energy group. PWC was appointed in late November to wind
up Enron's European division. PWC expects to recoup only about $100
million from contracts held by Enron Europe's main trading unit, Enron
Trade Capital Trade Resources. Liabilities in Europe would run in to the
billions of dollars, PWC has told creditors.  Many creditors are expecting
to recoup little or none of the money owed to them. Debt trading is legal
during administration but has to stop once the company is put into
liquidation, the next stage in the bankruptcy process. The administrators
are not necessarily aware of the details of the debt trading and will only
be able to see the impact when the company is liquidated and they try to
recover the remaining money owed to Enron. PWC will hold Enron creditors'
meetings in London next week followed by an auction of the contents of
Enron's London headquarters.

ICE to Move Natural Gas Trading to IPE First


   The European natural gas business on the IPE will be the first to move
onto the electronic platform of the IntercontinentalExchange following the
merger of the two exchanges. The move will likely be done this summer. ICE
took over the IPE last year in a bid to create a global electronic
platform for trading futures and over-the-counter products. ICE eventually
plans to transfer all of IPE's business online and away with open outcry
pit trading. ICE is owned by 100 of the world's largest energy and metals
traders, brokers and bankers. And, what a coincidence that EnronOnline got
out of ICE's way just in time as it was approaching critical mass. We were
just a tree in the forest, and then the forest burned down, says ICE's
CEO. From hosting 2,500 trades totaling $2 billion a day in September, ICE
now averages $4 billion per day and 4,600 trades.

Enron Trading Unit May Have Operated in Red


    Enron's energy trading unit may have been operating in the red for
months prior to its bankruptcy. Enron's Wholesale Services reported 3rd
quarter profits climbed to $696 million before interest and taxes, but its
profit margin dropped to 1.6%. The ratio of profit to sales does not
include funds borrowed to cover $2.8 billion in daily trades by
EnronOnline. In filings with the SEC, in the 3rd quarter, the last period
for which figures are available, Enron's trading revenue rose 54% to $43.4
billion. In July, Enron officials claimed that the trading unit was
dramatically expanding and profitable. The unit was credited with
producing 97% of Enron's 2000 revenue. Enron had $28 billion in revenue
from trading with a profit of $627 million, or a 2.2% margin before
interest and taxes in the 3rd quarter of 2000. Enron's energy trading unit
had a 1% profit after taxes and interest last year, according to
estimates. But, since Enron didn't account for the funds borrowed to cover
$2.8 billion in daily trades, profit margins may have been much lower or
nonexistent. Enron also had 3,000 affiliated partnerships which hid up to
$1 billion of losses and some industry insiders have said that Enron's
losses may have been too much for any trading unit to cover. One of the
partnerships bought 14 Enron power plants for $800 million in 1999, using
money that was generated by selling bonds backed by Enron shares. In the 2
years prior to its collapse, Enron sold billions of assets to independent
companies and at times for as little as $0.50 on the dollar. In 1999, it
received $247 million for a London power plant 10 months after opening it
at a cost of $500 million. Last year, Enron sold Azurix for $1.4 billion
after paying $2.8 billion for it in 1998. In fact almost everything other
than EnronOnline seemed to have to have lost money over the last few
yaers, from telecom to Indian power plants.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.
