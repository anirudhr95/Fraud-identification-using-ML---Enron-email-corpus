Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Moderating weather conditions on the ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT)
pipeline system will allow a limited amount of Due Shipper pay back to
be available over the weekend.  Shippers should schedule any imbalance
payback with their Operations Account Manager.

Customers that are in a Due Pipe position should be scheduling imbalance
makeup to the pipe through their Operations Account Manager.

All shippers and point operators should endeavor to stay balanced daily.
The opportunity to make up or pay back imbalances is entirely dependent
on the operating conditions of the pipe from day to day.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

"TE Critical System Warning","November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Natural Gas Futures Dip Slightly Lower

    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.024
yesterday to $2.048 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.001 to $2.09
per MMBtu. The market began the day higher on early short-covering, but
fell off sharply in the afternoon after an extended forecast called for
mild weather across much of the nation. Last week the AGA reported 124 Bcf
of natural gas was withdrawn from storage, leaving about a Tcf more still
in the ground than a year ago. Look for the market to take-out the $2.00
support level soon. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.12 per MMBtu. Look for
cash prices to weaken ahead of the weekend, likely leading futures prices
lower as well. With some cold in the Northeast and Midwest, but mild
temperatures forecast for the next two weeks, traders expect to see spot
prices at a discount to futures by the weekend. Turn-back volumes could
also weaken prices. By the end of January storage operators face
requirements to withdraw gas out of storage, the extra volumes hitting the
market could push prices further down.

Enron Creditors Want Andersen Investigation


    Enron's creditors' committee has asked the bankruptcy judge for
permission to investigate Andersen to help it prepare possible legal
action against the accounting firm. The committee wants to force Andersen
officials to testify and turn over documents. It was appointed last month
by the US Trustee's office, an arm of the Justice Department. Creditors,
which are owed $40 billion, are concerned that Enron may be worth less
than they thought. Andersen's CEO sent an auditing expert in his place to
testify yesterday before Congress on the destruction of documents related
to Enron. Another witness, David Duncan, a fired Andersen executive,
invoked his 5th Amendment rights against self-incrimination and refused to
testify at the hearing.

Enron's Top Management Departs


    As Enron struggles to survive, its top executives have been bailing
out. Of the 14 executives named in the company's annual 10-K filing with
the SEC last April, about half are gone. Vice Chairman Mark Frevert said
that he left the company at the end of December and seems uncertain
whether he quit or was fired. Greg Whalley, president and COO, will join
Swiss bank UBS which has acquired Enron's trading unit. Former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling and former Vice Chairman Clifford Baxter left the company last
year and Chairman Kenneth Lay resigned 2 days ago, in what some see as an
attempt to stave off the appointment of a bankruptcy trustee. A trustee
would supersede Enron's top management and its board of directors and
would likely name a new law firm to replace Enron's current bankruptcy
attorneys. A coalition of creditors has petitioned a bankruptcy judge to
appoint a Chapter 11 trustee to run Enron. To have a trustee appointed,
creditors must prove management's actions have been inept or fraudulent.
Document shredding and a suspected cover up of the company's true
financial liabilities could be adequate grounds to name a trustee. Lay's
departure leaves CFO Jeff McMahon and Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of
Enron Global Services in charge of the company for now. Enron plans to
hire a turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent
replacement is chosen. Three consulting firms that specialize in turning
around failing businesses have been mentioned as possible front-runners.
They are Alvarez & Marsal, Glass & Associates and Zolfo Cooper.

Judge Halts Andersen Shredding


    A federal judge has approved a plan from Enron shareholders to prevent
Andersen from shredding any more documents related to Enron's audits. The
judge ruled that plaintiffs lawyers can start taking depositions in 20
days from Andersen employees who were fired or suspended for the document
shredding. Andersen must also file a report with the judge explaining the
shredding at that time. But Andersen argues that it has not completed its
own investigation into the shredding, and depositions related to the
lawsuit should take a back seat to investigations by Congress, the SEC,
the Justice Department and others. The judge also ruled Andersen can shred
no more documents and that the firm must preserve all Enron-related
documents going back to 1994 and that plaintiffs' lawyers can inspect
them. Andersen attorneys assured the judge that the records are under
guard and shredding has ceased. Andersen has admitted that its Houston
staff shredded a significant but undetermined number of documents related
to Enron audits last fall as federal regulators launched probes into
possible accounting improprieties. The company later fired the head of the
Houston office for his role in the shredding and placed several others on
administrative leave. Attorneys for the plaintiffs' want to depose the
former partner and five others. Shareholders have filed a lawsuit against
29 current and former Enron executives and board members for more than $1
billion they gained by selling company stock during a 3-year period prior
its bankruptcy filing. Allegations have emerged that Enron employees
shredded accounting and finance documents as recently as last week. A
hearing on Enron shredding is scheduled for February 5th before federal
bankruptcy judge.

FERC to Hold Closed Meeting to Consider Investigation


     The FERC plans to hold a rare, closed-door meeting next week to
discuss a several issues, including the possible initiation of an
investigation. The private meeting will be held Wednesday, immediately
following FERC's regularly scheduled bi-monthly meeting that is open to
the public. The FERC issued a list of agency officials who will attend the
closed-door discussion of the possible investigation, including Chairman
Wood and the three commissioners, the office of general counsel, staff
with FERC's office of market tariffs, and staff with the office of the
executive director. Other items to be discussed at the closed meeting
include: 1) A demand by a group of natural gas producers in the Gulf of
Mexico that Williams cut its new gathering rates and other fees for
transporting volumes to shore. The producers claim that Williams has
boosted its rate for interruptible gathering by more than 230% since
December 1st; 2) A July complaint by New Power Holdings that PJM
Interconnection's capacity requirements and deficiency charges are unjust,
discriminatory and preferential. New Power wants PJM to change its
existing capacity deficiency rate of $177 per MW day; 3) A case involving
a FERC order last summer that says National Fuel Gas violated the law when
it operated a natural gas well and storage fields in Erie County, New
York, before obtaining authorization.

PSEG to Upgrade Coal Fired Plants in New Jersey


    PSEG has agreed to spend $300 million over 10 years to install
equipment to limit air pollution at its New Jersey coal fired power plants
to bring them into compliance with 'new source' review rules that require
the installation of air pollution equipment when a plant undergoes major
modifications. The agreement settles a complaint brought by the Justice
Department, the EPA and the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. The complaint alleged that PSEG failed to install necessary
pollution controls at two plants. The federal air pollution rule is
currently under review by the White House. Utilities with aging coal-fired
plants contend that the rule requires expensive upgrades which reduces
their ability to produce more energy. PSEG said it would rather resolve
the issue than face protracted and costly litigation. PSEG Power has about
17,000 MW of generation capacity. In 2004, the company will start to
phase-in equipment to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide
and mercury at 3 New Jersey coal-fired plants with a total capacity of
about 1,250 MW, with all work scheduled to be complete by 2012. PSEG will
install selective catalytic reduction and dry scrubber devices, which
remove particulates from exhaust before it is released into the air. The
new technologies will cost about $150 million each.

KeySpan Net Income Falls 42%


    KeySpan says 4th quarter net income fell 42% on lower natural gas
prices and expenses related to the sale of a barge business. Net income
declined to $34.4 million, or $0.25 per share, from $58.9 million, or
$0.43 a year earlier. Revenue fell 14% to $1.62 billion from $1.87
billion. KeySpan has agreed to sell its Midland Enterprises barge unit to
closely held Ingram Industries for $230 million in cash and $135 million
in assumed debt. It had expenses last quarter of $30.4 million, or $0.22
per share, related to the sale. KeySpan also wrote off the value of its
investment in natural gas reserves by $31.4 million, or $0.23, because of
lower natural gas prices. KeySpan owns 68% of Houston Exploration. It had
costs of $2.5 million on Roy Kay Cos, a general-contracting business it is
closing. Excluding those losses, KeySpan earned $99 million, or $0.71 per
share. It was expected to earn $0.75. KeySpan cut its 2002 earnings
forecast by $0.20 to $2.50 - $2.65, because it expects less profit from
exploration and production. KeySpan's Vice Chairman and Chief Operating
Officer Craig Matthews will retire, effective March 1st.

Cargill Halts Saltville Natural Gas Storage Expansion

     An planned expansion of a Virginia natural gas storage facility
planned by Duke Energy and NUI has failed to obtain FERC approval because
Cargill filed a complaint. Cargill asked the FERC to issue an order
halting the construction of an expanded salt cavern storage facility
planned for Saltville, Virginia. Duke and NUI formed a joint venture
called Saltville LLC to expand the salt cavern storage to hold 12 Bcf of
working natural gas capacity over the next 3 years. The site currently
stores only 1.1 Bcf. Cargill says that the companies are attempting to
circumvent the jurisdiction of FERC by seeking approval only from Virginia
state regulators even though the gas may be used in interstate commerce.
The expanded Saltville storage site would have a deliverability of up to
550 MMcf per day. The Virginia State Corporation Commission has scheduled
a February 20th hearing on the project.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

October 24, 2001 

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

Natural Gas Futures Higher on Colder Weather


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.058
yesterday to $$2.138 per MMBtu, propped up by cold weather in the Midwest
and Northeast. The April contract climbed $0.043 to $2.19 per MMBtu. The
market opened higher on colder weather across much of the nation, but
dipped below $2.10 briefly in the early afternoon before short-covering
boosted prices before the close, holding in a $0.055 range. Funds were
buying early with the cold weather keeping the sellers at bay. Look for
the cold weather to drive the market to test $2.15 resistance today, with
a good chance of testing the $2.21 level. The market is still bottom
building, moving quietly in a sideways range, causing any short-covering
rally to be met with selling into resistance. With winter ending soon and
a Tcf in excess storage, the gravitational pull on the market is
tremendous. The withdrawals over the last several weeks have been larger
than just pure weather-related withdrawals, so a marginal amount of
natural gas coming out storage is supplementing daily production in the
market. The estimated volume was 69,100 contracts, with 34,800 of those
hedges or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally $0.05 - $0.15 higher yesterday on short-term cold
weather in the Midwest to the Northeast, forcing price squeezes at certain
pipelines on marketers who were short to begin the new month. The trend
for this month is still softer cash prices. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.07 to $2.14 per MMBtu.

FERC Drops Complaint Against BPA and Others

     The FERC has dismissed a complaint by Californians for Renewable
Energy, a citizens group that claimed BPA and 3 other firms withheld badly
needed electricity during the state's power crisis. The group filed a
complaint last April, during the height of the crisis, when wholesale
power prices had galloped 10 times higher and customers were hit with a
series of rolling blackouts. The group accused BPA, Canada's BC Hydro,
Powerex and Mirant of withholding wholesale power supplies to boost prices
during the crisis. The BPA, which supplies about half of the Pacific
Northwest's power through huge hydropower dams, is owned by the federal
government. BC Hydro is owned by the provincial government of British
Columbia. The FERC dismissed the complaint because the group's allegations
are vague and similar issues were decided by the commission in other
cases.

Dynegy Takes Over Northern Natural Gas Pipeline


    Dynegy, which acquired the Northern Natural Gas pipeline from Enron
after investing $1.5 billion in the energy trader, will take over the
pipelines trading and marketing today. The system, valued at $2.7 billion,
runs 16,600 miles from Texas to the Great Lakes. Enron had contested the
takeover after Dynegy backed out of its plan to buy Enron for $23 billion
in November. Earlier this month, Enron gave up the pipeline, but is
proceeding with a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynegy for terminating their
deal. Northern Natural has a capacity of 4.3 Bcf of natural gas per day
and has valuable connection points with other pipelines. Although Dynegy
operates many pipelines, Northern Natural is their first foray into
pipeline ownership. Dynegy paid $23 million to complete the purchase and
named Daniel Dienstbier as the systems president, a position he held
before becoming president of Enron's Gas Pipeline Group in 1985. Dynegy
also assumed $900 million of Northern Natural's debt. Enron employees will
run and maintain Northern Natural until Enron's option to buy it back
expires June 30th. But most think that is unlikely to happen, given
Enron's current state of affairs.

FERC Approves Tuscarora Pipeline Expansion


    The  has given final approval to Tuscarora Gas Transmission's plan to
expand its pipeline system to bring more natural gas to industrial
customers in northern Nevada. The Tuscarora natural gas pipeline was built
in 1995 in a partnership between Sierra Pacific Resources and TransCanada
PipeLines. The $60 million, 14-mile pipeline extension would almost double
the capacity in the area from 125 MMcf per day to 220 MMcf per day. The
expanded pipeline capacity will serve Duke Energy's 540 MW plant near
Wadsworth, Nevada and Morgan Stanley's 360 MW power plant near Reno. The
229-mile pipeline stretches from Malin, Oregon through northern California
to Sierra Pacific's Tracy power station near Reno.

FERC to Probe Enron's Role in California Power Crisis

    At the urging of Democrats representing Western states, the FERC has
launched a probe into allegations that Enron illegally manipulated
wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. One
California senator also demanded that the FERC provide a list of meetings
and telephone calls between the commission and Enron executives from
August 2000 through June 2001. Enron has denied any wrongdoing. The
Democratic senator pointed to news reports that former Enron chairman Ken
Lay met with Vice President Cheney in April, 2001 and discussed the
California power crisis. The next day, Cheney said he opposed price caps,
the senator said. The senator is questioning whether Enron used influence
in secret meetings with the vice president or the FERC to persuade them to
do nothing about the state's soaring power prices. However, the
administration has always opposed price caps. But the FERC chairman said
that his staff has already started to look into the allegations. The probe
will involve FERC's office of general counsel and office of market tariffs
and rates. The chairman declined to elaborate on the scope of the probe.
The legislators cited a study by an independent consultant showing that
California prices fell by 30% soon after Enron declared bankruptcy in
December. The Democrats say that a key factor in higher power prices was
Enron's dealings in unregulated financial derivatives in the natural gas
market while controlling a large share of the market.

Plains States Hit with Icy Storm and Power Outages

    A brutal ice storm in the Plains states and Midwest knocked out power
to one million utility customers, causing some of the biggest
storm-related outages in history, according to the utilities. In Oklahoma,
the governor declared a state of emergency in 28 of the state's 77
counties. The storm may leave some customers without power for up to a
week. Freezing rain and ice downed power lines and snapped trees around
Oklahoma, leaving more than 230,000 customers without electricity with
temperatures in the low 20s. Oklahoma Gas & Electric said it was the worst
storm in the 100-year history of the company in terms of customers
affected. Yesterday evening, about 176,000 OG&E customers still had no
electricity, about 123,000 of them in Oklahoma City. The utility said at
least 60 miles of high-voltage transmission lines, ranging from 69 kV to
345 kV, were on the ground, but it has been able to reroute power around
the downed transmission lines. Kansas City was also hit by the worst ice
storm in 16 years, with more than 100,000 customers without power. Repair
crews from other areas were being brought in to clear downed trees and
restore electricity. Kansas City Power & Light had 90 line crews and 100
tree crews working around the clock. KCP&L said as many as 285,000
customers were without power overnight. In the upper Midwest, the storm
knocked out power to almost 100,000 customers in southern Michigan, but
did not damage the high-voltage transmission grid in Michigan.

FERC Drops California Natural Gas Price Reports

    After reviewing what data it needed to monitor all US energy markets,
the FERC plans to stop requiring companies to report monthly California
natural gas prices. The FERC began requiring monthly California price data
from natural gas sellers and pipelines last July during the state's power
crisis. Last summer, natural gas prices oared above $18 per MMBtu in the
state's spot market while other US prices remained much lower. However,
the commission indicated that it might require other kinds of energy
pricing data to be reported on a regular basis. The decision to drop the
reporting was supported by energy companies which said the requirement was
costly and burdensome.

California PUC Reaches Agreement on Bonds

    The California PUC has agreed on a plan to let the state sell up to
$12.5 billion of bonds, the largest municipal bond sale in US history. The
governor and PUC argued over options for repaying the bonds after the
regulator rejected an initial proposal in October. Bond proceeds would be
used to cover the state's cost of buying electricity for utilities that
ran up billions of dollars in debt under the state's deregulation law. The
PUC has issued a proposed plan that would let the state Department of
Water Resources sell the bonds.  The state has spent $11.8 billion buying
electricity. Comments on the plan are due by February 5th and the FERC
expects to vote on the agreement at a February 21st meeting. But it may be
very difficult to sell the bonds by June 30th, even if a plan is approved
soon.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Natural Gas Futures End Friday Flat


    Natural gas futures for March delivery on the NYMEX  ended another
boring session flat for the day last Friday at $2.138 per MMBtu. The April
contract gained $0.008 to $2.198 per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but
was soon boosted by short-term cold and short-covering from speculators
and locals pushing as high as $2.165 per MMBtu. Buy-stops were believed to
be above $2.17 per MMBtu, and will still likely be there today. Estimated
volume Friday was only about 50,400 contracts, with 19,600 of those
spreads. There just was not enough volume to hit the buy-stops as the
market hovered mostly between $2.14 - $2.15. With the market unable to
breach $2.17, speculators were forced to back-off late. If $2.17 can be
breached today, the market could rise to the next resistance level at
$2.22, and then possibly as high as $2.48 before reality once again sinks
in. However, if the cash market opens lower this morning, the market may
not get a chance to test the resistance. With still more than 1 Tcf in
excess storage over last year and a relatively mild winter so far, the
market's short to medium term bias is still down. Natural gas for weekend
delivery across the US and Canada was generally flat to $0.10 higher
Friday. Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.05 to
$2.19 per MMBu.

Enron Power Trading Falls in 4th Quarter


    Enron's 4th quarter power trading volumes were about 26% lower than
the previous quarter, which is surprising since it was bankrupt for a
third of the quarter and in deep trouble for over half of the period.
Enron Power Marketing sold almost 221 million MW from October through
December, down from about 300 million MW sold during the 3rd quarter. Last
week, the FERC began investigating allegations that Enron unfairly raised
wholesale power prices during California's power crisis last year. After
Enron took a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity related to its
off-balance-sheet transactions, other energy firms limited their trading
with Enron out of concern credit obligations. In the first 3 quarters of
2001, Enron had about 15% of the nations wholesale power market and AEP
was next in line with about an 8% share. The table below shows Enron's
biggest customers, the total MW sold and the highest price paid by each
for the 4th quarter.

Mirant Moving to Allay Investor Fears


    In an attempt to allay the fears of investors, Mirant plans to sell
assets and reduce expenditures to lower its debt. Shares of Mirant have
fallen by 50% in the last 2 months, following the downfall of Enron and
the downgrade of about $4.9 billion of its debt to junk status by Moody's.
Last week, Mirant said that 4th quarter earnings had dropped by 55%, due
to lower energy prices and a charge of $66 million from exposure to Enron.
It also cut its capital budget by 50% and lowered its earnings forecast in
2002 to $1.60 to $1.70 per share, from its December estimate of  $1.90 to
$2.00, because of lower profit margins. Mirant expects 1st quarter profits
of $0.30 per share, lower than last year's $0.52 per share. Profit for the
4th quarter dipped to $30 million, or $0.09 per share, from $67 million,
or $0.20 per share a year ago. Revenue was off 9%, to $7.24 billion from
$7.96 billion. Mirant was spun off from Southern Company in September 2000
and the deal was completed last April, when Southern distributed 272
million shares, or 80% of Mirant for $9.44 billion. In efforts to distance
itself from Enron, Mirant points out that assets, such as power plants,
contributed 90% to its profitability, unlike Enron, whose trading unit was
responsible for 90% of its 2000 revenue. Mirant has delayed plans to spend
$3 billion on tripling its 15,000 MW of power this year. Instead it will
limit capital spending to the completion of power plants that will produce
5,700 MW. Mirant will also cut about 65% of job at its German unit, Bewag,
which it wants to sell.

Midwest ISO Begins Selling Regional Transmission Service

    The Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator has implemented
its tariff and will now provide regional transmission service for bulk
power in the Midwest ISO footprint. Transmission customers are now able to
request transmission service from Midwest ISO without going to individual
transmission owners. The Midwest ISO, which serves 21 transmission owners
in 15 states, is responsible for evaluating and coordinating requests for
access to the regional power grid on a non-discriminatory basis. The
Midwest ISO says that transmission customers in the Midwest will now
benefit from standardized rates, terms and conditions for service over its
86,000 miles of transmission lines. Transmission customers are now able to
request transmission service from the MISO's OASIS website, giving them
the ability to view transmission availability data at the same time and
request transmission service in the same manner. It also provides for
streamlined electronic scheduling which allows customers to easily
schedule approved transactions for service across multiple control areas
in the MISO footprint. In addition, customers will now have access to an
independent, regional analysis of bulk power flows utilizing a standard
methodology. The MISO will provide a single bill to customers for all
transmission service provided.

Wisconsin Energy Power Plant Plan

    Wisconsin Energy plans to build $3 billion in new electricity
generators over the next nine years to meet growing energy demands.
Forecasts indicate Wisconsin will need more than the 2,800 MW the new
units will generate by 2011. The projects include 2 natural gas fired
generators and 3 coal burning units at existing power plants. Other power
producers including Calpine and Mirant have delayed new construction in
the state because of lower electricity demand and prices. The first
natural gas fired should be under construction by early next year to be in
service before the summer of 2005. Wisconsin Energy has created a
subsidiary that would build and own the generators and lease them back to
the utility for up to 25 years. Calpine, Enron and PG&E had opposed the
proposal, saying it would delay deregulation in the state by more than a
decade.

"System Imbalance Notice","October 24, 2001

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and
Shippers

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

the September, October and November 2001 statements and are 
adjusted to reflect plant operations at 95% of its normal 
capacity for the month.  The appropriate IT transportation rate 
will apply to liquifiable transactions.

Please direct any questions regarding this subject to your 
Transportation Scheduling Representative or Production Area 
Customer Services Representative.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"AGT Critical System Warning","November 25, 2001

Effective immediately, based on anticipated system operations and
weather conditions, as stated below, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) is
requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt steps to
eliminate excess receipts and to conform scheduled receipts to actual
deliveries.

Weather continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been
scheduling gas in excess of actual takes. As a result, there is no line
pack available for system operational purposes and AGT cannot continue
to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.

AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations ?and revise
scheduled quantities? immediately to halt the further accumulation of
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.

No due pipe imbalance makeup will be accepted until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Natural Gas Futures End Up on Short-Covering

    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX  settled up
$0.046 yesterday at $2.25 per MMBtu on funds short covering. The March
contract gained $0.037 to $2.24 per MMBtu. Funds held an all-time high
number of net short positions, 47,104 on January 8th, according to the
CFTC report. Mild weather and huge levels of natural gas in storage
battled with short-covering rallies to keep the market trading in a $0.15
range over the past week, a trend likely to continue until fundamentals
change. Support has been constant at $2.14 per MMBtu, a level that has
been tested in October, the end of November and last week. Expect
resistance to be tested tosday at $2.38 and maybe $2.48 with technical
support at $2.23, $2.14 and then $1.88. In the longer term, declining rig
counts point to natural gas production levels dropping and supply
tightening as the storage excess is worked off this summer. Last week, the
total rig count was 856 compared with 1,121 a year ago. A 25% reduction in
exploration and development programs is expected this
year as companies cut back capital budgets in response to the lower
prices. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to up $0.05 Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub gained $0.02 to $2.32 per MMBtu.

 Lawmaker Accuses Enron Executives of Insider Trading

    Rep John Dingell of Michigan, the top Democrat on the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, claims to have pretty strong evidence of insider
trading as well as false accounting in the collapse of Enron. He also says
that there is clear evidence of failure to file honest and correct annual
reports required by the SEC. Dingell says that false accounting appears to
be a very major problem, and it appears that both Enron and Andersen were
involved. Andersen, Enron's accounting firm, has admitted that it
destroyed a number of documents. Some Enron shareholders have filed a
lawsuit accusing Enron executives and directors of unlawful insider
trading and misleading the investing public. The Justice Department is
also investigating. Dingell is one of 188 House of Representative members
who received campaign contributions from Enron.

Employees Letter Warns of Enron's Collapse


    An unidentified employee sent a letter to Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay
last summer that alleged the company would implode in a wave of accounting
scandals unless the it changed its accounting practices. The employee also
met with Lay to provide proof. Two congressmen have demanded all records
relating to a review of the employee's allegations, made by outside
attorneys. The employee said that a veil of secrecy surrounded Enron's
partnerships, which moved large amounts of debt off the company's balance
sheets. According to the letter, several senior Enron employees
consistently questioned the company's accounting practices to senior Enron
officials, including CEO Skilling. Enron has hired an outside law firm to
review the charges, but allegedly told the attorneys not to second-guess
accounting advice and not to analyze the questioned transactions in
detail. The law firms review concluded that the questions raised by the
employee did not merit further investigation by independent counsel and
auditors, according to the congressmen. But the review noted that there
was a serious risk of adverse publicity and litigation from the
partnership transactions.

Oil Majors Seeking Foothold in Power and Natural Gas Sector

    Oil majors like ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco are looking to expand
their power assets in developing countries and create a stronger presence
in the deregulated North American power market. But, antitrust regulations
could present a road block to more consolidation. Shell and BP have
already entered the growing natural gas and power markets, as backers of
Intercontinental Exchange. Among the majors, Shell has made the most
inroads into the power market with its 68% share of Intergen, a joint
venture with Bechtel. However, Shell has the smallest presence in the
natural gas market of any of the big integrated oil companies. Shell says
it is interested in strengthening its exploration and extraction
activities, and especially its natural gas business, which could also
include acquisitions. In the past 3 years, Shell has only made $6 billion
worth of acquisitions, far less than some competitors. Concerns over
antitrust regulations in the US has led big oil companies to increase
their power assets in developing countries, where demand growth will be
the strongest. ExxonMobil has 6000 MW of power generation capabilities in
China, and is considering other projects in Europe, Asia, Africa and
Central America. An expected switch from oil to cleaner burning fuels has
also provided an incentive for big oil to invest in wind and solar power.
BP is the biggest solar power producer in the world and Shell is actively
involved in the sector. BP Solar has manufacturing plants in the US,
Spain, Australia and India and a 20% market share worldwide. Shell
launched its first commercial US wind power station last year and has
committed to spend up to $1 billion by 2006 on renewables.

Brownell Says FERC Should End El Paso Case

   The FERC should expeditiously wrap up its investigation into whether El
Paso manipulated the California natural gas market last winter to inflate
prices by billions of dollars, according to FERC Commissioner Brownell.
The California PUC, PG&E, and Southern California Edison claim El Paso
withheld capacity on pipelines into the state from November 2000 through
March 2001. El Paso has maintained it is innocent of any wrongdoing.
Brownell says that if there are violations of rules, the rule breakers
should be punished. But, barring such violations, those firms should be
exonerated, she said in a filing with the ALJ overseeing the El Paso case.
The ALJ ruled last October that El Paso did not drive up natural gas
prices on its pipeline into California at a time when the state was
struggling with an energy crisis. But FERC reopened the El Paso
investigation in December, saying the issue needed to be reexamined to
ensure consumers were protected.

Memo Directs Anderson Employees to Destroy Enron Documents


    A memo directing Andersen employees to destroy everything except basic
work papers related to its Enron audits, just 4 days before Enron revealed
a $618 million loss, has caused many to question whether an obstruction of
justice occurred. Thousands of e-mails and other files that might have
shed some light on the events leading up to Enron's bankruptcy were lost,
according to reports. Andersen said that some employees destroyed the
Enron files before the SEC began its investigation. A Senate panel has
issued subpoenas for documents from Enron, Andersen and 49 current and
former officers and directors. Andersen is the subject of a Congressional
investigation, a federal criminal inquiry and lawsuits from shareholders
that may cost it billions of dollars. There has been speculation that
Andersen is considering a merger with another member of the Big 5
accounting firms to prevent its collapse. According to reports, Andersen
supervisors repeatedly reminded employees of the memo prior to the
issuance of subpoenas by the SEC. Enron paid Andersen $25 million last
year for its audit and $27 million for consulting fees and other matters.
In addition, Enron's chief accounting officer and its CFO previously
worked for Andersen. Last year Andersen settled a lawsuit over its
accounting work, which was brought by shareholders of Sunbeam, for $110
million. It also agreed to a $20 million settlement in a class-action
lawsuit stemming from its audit of trash company Waste Management.

Enron Plummets Off PFC 50 Ranking as Russian Majors Move Up

    Other than the September 11th disaster, Enron's collapse is the
biggest story in the capital markets in 2001 and within the PFC 50. Enron,
once ranked as high as 5th among global energy companies, left the natural
gas and power landscape dramatically changed. However, in the midst of the
turmoil in US energy markets, the Russian energy majors clearly emerged as
winners in 2001, surpassing all of the PFC 50 companies in market returns.
Among the Russian companies in the PFC 50, Yukos entered the rankings at
number 38. Gazprom moved up 6 spots to 35. Lukoil and Surgutneftegaz were
at spots 44 and 33 respectively. Conoco and Phillips were the 2 of the
most active players in M&A in the PFC 50 in 2001. Their recent plans to
merge, coupled with the acquisitions of Tosco and Gulf Canada in 2001,
signals the continuing importance of consolidation in the energy sector.
Also, the swap agreement between E.On and BP reinforces the trend of
convergence within industry consolidation. Pending regulatory approval, E
On will increase its share in Ruhrgas to over 32%, and BP will acquire a
51% stake in Veba Oel. From a convergence standpoint, the swap will give E
On added strength in its efforts to expand its natural gas business in
Europe. As a result of Enron's fallout, credit quality for Enron's peers
has been re-assessed and downgraded in some cases. In response to credit
reassessments and poor market performance, companies such as El Paso,
Dynegy, Williams and have initiated capital restructuring programs to
reassure investors, creditors, and rating agencies. Given the credit
watches and budget cutbacks, the PFC 50 report examines which of the
merchant energy companies and utilities are best suited to capture some of
Enron's lost market share. The PFC 50 serves as a reference guide for
international energy companies competing in a changing and converging
landscape. The PFC 50 report is updated quarterly and covers top
performers, M&A, strategies, and business models. Visit www.pfcenergy.com

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Late Short-Covering


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX powered upward
yesterday, driven by locals short-covering near the close. It ran as high
as $2.08 per MMBtu before expiring up $0.098 at $2.006 per MMBtu, but
still down 23% from when it began as the prompt month at $2.619 per MMBtu.
The March contract rose $0.083 to $2.067 per MMBtu. The expiration was the
lowest since October's $1.83 finish in late September. And prospects
remain bearish for the new prompt March contract, surrounded by bearish
technical and fundamental signals. Look for support at $1.76-$1.80. Mild
weather across much of the nation and the huge storage excess sent prices
mainly downward all month. Traders saw funds covering short positions
during the morning, with trading houses covering in the early afternoon.
Locals, which were short near the close, started buying. The market still
carries a huge $0.965 forward carry between the February-March contract
and January 2003. The larger that forward carry, the more bearish the
market can be. Look for more short-covering before selling brings the
market back down. The AGA will release its weekly  storage report this
afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 110 - 120 Bcf. The 5-year average
for the week is 150 Bcf.  A year ago there was a draw of 128 Bcf.
Yesterday's estimated volume was 127,000 contacts, with 47,000 of those
hedge or spreads. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 yesterday as cold weather moves
back into the Midwest. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub
lost $0.05 to $1.97 per MMBtu.

Merrill Lynch Top Executives Involved in Enron Partnership

   A report that Merrill Lynch executives invested in a limited
partnership, LJM2, which was used by Enron to inflate earnings and hide
debt from shareholders, has sent the investment company scurrying to deny
any wrongdoing. Merrill Lynch invited managing directors and senior
executives to invest in the partnerships after it helped Enron raise $349
million for the partnership from pension funds and other institutional
investors. Critics say that some investment banks may have been less
stringent in their scrutiny of Enron because senior executives were doing
business with it and had a vested interest in its profits, raising
questions about conflict of interest. The investments may be subject to
congressional examination after the House Energy and Commerce Committee
subpoenaed Enron's partnership records, including the identities of
investors. Enron has revealed that its former CFO made $30 million from 2
partnerships, including LJM2. Merrill Lynch says that the investment
partnership is in line with common industry practices. Merrill Lynch
claims that it was offered to qualified external as well as internal
investors, which would not be a conflict of interest.

CFTC Says No Enron Market Manipulation

    Enron did not try to engage in market manipulation at any futures
exchange, according to testimony before the Senate Energy Committee by the
chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Both the CFTC
chairman and the FERC chairman said they did not see a need for new
federal market regulation because of Enron. FERC has found no substantial
spillover effects into the energy markets because of Enron. In the
aftermath of Enron's collapse, prices and energy markets remained stable,
with neither electric nor natural gas deliveries being disrupted.

Enron Names Bankruptcy Specialist as Interim CEO


    Enron has named Stephen Cooper, managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, as
interim chief executive officer and chief restructuring officer. Enron
also named Jeff McMahon as president and chief operating officer and Ray
Bowen as CFO. Cooper, McMahon and Bowen will take on the task of trying to
raise Enron from the ashes after its collapse. Coopers firm specializes in
resurrecting bankrupt companies. Cooper is currently handling the
bankruptcy reorganization of Greyhound Lines parent Laidlaw Inc, but
Laidlaw's restructuring is almost complete. Industry experts say that
Cooper must now balance the demands of the bankruptcy with running the
remaining businesses and handling the lawsuits and investigations related
to Enron's collapse. The new CEO says that with more than 19,000 employees
worldwide, Enron has real businesses with real value. He said that his
team will work closely with the Board of Directors, management and the
creditors' committee to develop a reorganization plan to maximize value
for the company's shareholders. He has already begun working for Enron.
Greg Whalley, who had been president and CEO resigned to take a position
with UBS Warburg, which acquired Enron's energy trading unit 2 weeks ago.
Enron has also agreed to sell businesses and long-term contracts for more
than $520 million and relinquished control of Northern Natural Pipeline to
Dynegy. Additionally, it plans to sell Portland General Electric to
Northwest Natural Gas for about $3 billion. There has been no word of when
the Board of Directors will name a new chairman to replace Ken Lay.

Senate Committee Examines Enron's Impact on Energy Markets


     Conventional futures exchanges like the NYMEX are entirely regulated
by the CFTC. But the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, passed
by Congress after a big lobbying effort by Enron, removed over-the-counter
and some on-line energy transactions from CFTC control. Those exempted
markets made up the bulk of Enron's trading operations. The CFTC is
working with the White House on auditing and accounting standards, and the
combination of its market supervisory functions under one agency division.
Although at least 8 other congressional probes are being conducted into
the financial and accounting facets of Enron's demise, the Senate Energy
Committee's authority is limited to the effects of Enron's meltdown on
energy markets and consumers. Legislators at the hearing saw little impact
from Enron on US energy markets. Some on the panel referred to it as
business failure, not an energy market failure. Even though the chairman
of the NYMEX has not call for any greater regulation of over-the-counter
markets, he has called on regulators to treat on-line exchanges and
traditional pit-based ones equally.

Derivatives at Root of Enron Collapse


    Enron's extensive use of derivatives, not just its accounting
practices, lie at the root of its fall into bankruptcy. Enron had used
profits from its derivatives trading operation, which was little
understood by investors, to mask losses in its more visible businesses
even as some of its employees may have been fraudulently manipulating
those profits. Enron reaped huge profits from derivatives.  But it lost
billions on most everything else it did, including projects in fiber-optic
bandwidth, retail natural gas and power, water systems and technology
stocks, but used its expertise in derivatives to hide these losses.
Derivatives are complex financial contracts whose values are linked to
underlying variables such as the prices of commodities, stocks or bonds.
They are used by sophisticated investors to manage risk. Enron's use of
derivatives both outside and inside the company can likely be directly
linked to its collapse. On the outside, they were used to create the
company's web of off-balance sheet deals with complex financial
partnerships known as special-purpose vehicles. After some of those deals
went sour, Enron in October took a $1 billion charge against earnings and
a $1.2 billion write-down in shareholder equity, triggering its nosedive
into bankruptcy. But Enron's derivatives problems ran far deeper than the
outside special purpose vehicles. It appears that some Enron employees
used dummy accounts and rigged valuation methodologies to create false
profit and loss entries for the derivatives Enron traded.

Williams' Shares Plunge 22% on Telecom Debt


    Shares of Williams tumbled 22% yesterday after it reported it may have
up to $2.4 billion in costs from Williams Communications which was spun
off last April. Williams may have to pay $1.4 billion in Williams
Communications debt if its credit rating falls below investment grade. It
also may owe $750 million in Williams Communications fiber optic-network
leases and $250 million in other expenses. Shares of Williams
Communications dropped 80% last year as growth evaporated with the dot.com
collapse. In the past month, Williams sold securities and cut capital
spending to strengthen its balance sheet amid increased scrutiny by
credit-rating agencies in the wake of Enron's collapse. It also plans to
sell assets to maintain the all-important investment-grade debt rating.
Because of the debt review, Williams delayed reporting 4th quarter results
that had been scheduled for release yesterday. The review will have no
direct impact on Williams Communications business, the company said in a
statement. However, the stock market is in the process of evaluating the
situation and is assuming the worst. Williams' shares fell $5.3, to $18.78
yesterday. Its 7.75% coupon maturing in 2031 fell about $42 to $921 per
$1,000 face value from $963. That pushed the yield up to 8.48% from 8.08%.
Williams's convertible preferred stock, which was sold this month at $25,
tumbled $3.93 to $21.65 per share. Enron had $724 million in losses from
telecommunications in the 3rd quarter. Global Crossing filed for
bankruptcy protection Monday after it accumulated $12 billion in debt it
was unable to repay because of falling sales. Shares Williams
Communications fell $0.29 to $1.34 yesterday.

To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

"FW: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance","FYI

-----Original Message-----
From: infopost@duke-energy.com [mailto:infopost@duke-energy.com]
Sent: Sunday, November 25, 2001 12:00 AM
To: infopost@duke-energy.com
Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

Natural Gas Slips Lower Before Long Weekend


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped $0.018 Friday
to $2.236 per MMBtu in subdued pre-holiday trading. The March contract
lost $0.018 to $2.236 per MMBtu. With no fundamentals to drive the market
higher, but a general reluctance to short the market before a long holiday
weekend kept trading quiet within a $0.05 range between $2.21 - $2.26 per
MMBtu. The NYMEX was closed Monday in observance of Martin Luther King Jr
Day and will resume operations today. The AGA weekly storage report will
be released on Wednesday this week as usual. Physical prices tumbled
Friday into the long weekend, sliding down on a lack of cold weather and a
NYMEX that seems ready to head in the same direction. Natural gas for
weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.10 - $0.20
Friday due to a mild weather forecast. Natural gas for next day delivery
at the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $2.28 per MMBtu.

Court Questions AEP Purchase of CSW


    A federal appeals court is raising new questions about the $10 billion
acquisition of Central & South West Corp by American Electric Power, and
has told the SEC to reconsider its approval of the purchase. The
acquisition created a utility that stretches from Virginia to Texas, with
5 million customers in 11 states. At issue is the SEC's conclusion that
the combined company met Public Utility Holding Company Act requirements
that utility networks be physically interconnected and confined to a
single area or region. The court says the PUC failed to explain its
conclusions regarding the interconnection requirement' and failed to
justify its finding that the proposed acquisition will satisfy the single
area or region requirement.

    UBS's proposed acquisition of Enron's energy trading business could be
worth between $1 billion to $2 billion to Enron over the next several
years, according to testimony given to the bankruptcy judge last week. If
the deal is not approved, the liquidation value of the company could be
only $50 million. The judge is deliberating whether to approve a deal that
would allow UBS to pay Enron for its energy trading business out of future
earnings in lieu of cash up front. A creditors group that opposes the UBS
deal, saying the projections were speculative, especially since Enron's
trading business is not currently in operation. About 20 small energy and
exploration companies that traded with Enron, called the Dunhill Group,
say that the creditors will bear a higher percentage of the cost and risk
of the new business with UBS. The deal would hasten the depletion of
Enron's estate, the creditors allege. Under the terms of the deal, UBS
would license Enron's intellectual property, lease its real estate and
hire Enron employees to run the operation, but the bank would not assume
any of Enron's liabilities. The transaction does not include any pending
commodity trades and derivative contracts entered into by Enron prior to
its filing for bankruptcy. The outstanding deals are worth more than $4
billion. Enron is attempting to settle the commodity and derivative
contracts to help pay off debts. The agreement would give UBS the sole
rights to Enron's trading software for the next decade. Initially the bank
would pay royalties of 33% of pretax profit from the trading business to
Enron. UBS would also pay $5 million of the $11 million in incentive
bonuses promised to Enron's natural gas and power employees after the 1st
year. Then UBS would have the option to buy out Enron's royalty interest
in the 3rd year. Early payment by UBS could trim the royalties to 22% of
the operation's pretax earnings, then down to 11%, and then eventually
obliterate them.

PG&E Proceeds with Bankruptcy Plans

    Pacific Gas & Electric is moving forward with plans to emerge from
bankruptcy by the end of the year, despite objections by the California
PUC. The PUC opposes the bankruptcy plan which includes the transfer of
utility assets to its parent company, effectively removing them from state
regulatory control. The court gave the PUC until February 13th to file an
outline of its proposal. PG&E is skeptical of the PUC's ability to present
a credible plan, that would receive shareholder support. However, the PUC
is confident that it can develop a plan that is better for consumers and
that creditors would approve of. The bankruptcy judge is considering the
appointment of a mediator to help the two sides reach a settlement. PG&E
will file its response to the idea in a week.

SEC Suspends New Energy Securities Trading

  The SEC has suspended trading of New Energy securities over questions
involving the adequacy and accuracy of public disclosures. Trading of
securities will be suspended through February 1st. Questions were raised
about the adequacy and accuracy of information concerning the value of
certain power generation contracts, the existence and size of certain
purchase orders for solar chips and its partner's relationship with the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. New Energy says it is confident
that the issues could be resolved and that trading would resume when the
suspension over. It is the distribution and marketing arm of privately
held Megawatt, which makes solar power generators. New Energy had no
revenues last year. New Energy shares were last down $0.55 to $2.90 in
over-the-counter trading.

FPL 4th Quarter Profits Jump 82%

    The FPL Group posted an 82% increase in 4th quarter earnings over last
year. Profits for the quarter increased $0.70 per share to $118 million
from $65 million, or $0.38 per share. Revenue dipped to $1.84 billion from
$1.86 billion as the economic slump decreased electricity demand. Florida
Power & Light saw its profits jump by 18% to $109 million, or $0.65 per
share. The utility added almost 87,000 customers last year expects to add
65,000 more this year. Its customer base has been expanding at double the
national rate. Earnings for FPL Energy climbed 11% to $10 million, or
$0.06 per share. The unit operates power plants in about 15 states and
expects to add 3,700 MW of generation by 2004. An accounting change in the
last quarter related to derivatives added $3 million, or $0.02 per share,
to FPL's net income. Excluding the items, FPL's profit climbed 8.5% to
$115 million, or $0.68 per share, from $106 million, or $0.62, matching
the average estimate of analysts. The FPL Energy unit plans to acquire
power plants in its operation areas but is waiting to see prices that
reflect distressed sales. FPL added 5,063 MW of generating capacity
outside Florida, 23% over last year. If Congress extends tax credits for
renewable energy, the company plans to build 500 to 1,000 MW per year of
wind driven generators in the next several years. Two FPL shareholders
have filed a lawsuit seeking the repayment of more than $53 million in
retention bonuses given to nine FP&L executives before the Entergy
agreement collapsed.

Moody's May Change Companies' Rating Procedure


      Responding to severe market criticism, Moody's Investors Service is
considering making changes in how it rates companies. The changes, which
should be ready for discussion in a few weeks, could cause ratings to rise
or fall faster, affecting companies' ability to raise money. The review
follows criticism of the agencies' perceived lack of speed in downgrading
Enron's ratings to junk status in November.  Moody's is preparing a
special comment on the matter that should be issued in a few weeks. The
changes could include more multi-notch upgrades or downgrades of company
ratings; a speeding up of rating reviews into a matter of weeks, rather
than a few months; and perhaps the elimination of rating outlooks. Some
feel within Moody's that the ratings are too sticky, or move too slowly.
Some argue that Moody's should accept greater volatility in order to
improve the predictive power of ratings. A rise in negative rating actions
would depress bond prices and leave many companies facing higher funding
costs or more difficulty in raising money. S&P and Fitch have begun
focusing more on liquidity, or the ability of companies to access the cash
they need to run their businesses, since the Enron debacle. A policy shift
could have the effect of making it more difficult for borderline credits
to survive an economic downturn. ""If Moody's moves ahead with the changes,
it could mark a major structural change in the corporate bond market that
could lead to structurally higher volatility.

Natural Gas Futures Slip Slightly Lower



    Natural gas Futures for February delivery on the NYMEX settled $0.003
lower yesterday at $2.272 per MMBtu. The March contract lost $0.004 to
$2.261 per MMBtu. With short-covering from locals and funds in the front
and trade buying in the back months, the market reached $2.35 by
mid-afternoon but then quickly sold off late in the session. The technical
buying on what was being termed an oversold market came in late morning as
locals and funds tried to cover positions, then punched in buy-stops into
the mid-$2.30 before corporate trading houses took profits and sold down
the contract late. It turned out to be a long day's journey to just about
nowhere. Look for the market drop lower early today as yesterday's late
sell-off continues. However, the AGA is expected to report higher
withdrawal tomorrow afternoon than in recent weeks. Early predictions are
for a withdrawal of about  150 - 160 Bcf, compared to 167 Bcf a year ago.
The 5-year average for the week is 118 Bcf. More short-covering later
today could push the market as high as $2.40-$2.50, but it is more likely
to wait for the storage report for direction. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally down $0.05 - $0.10
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.06
to $2.30 per MMBtu.

FPL Begins Operation of New Wind Power Projects

    FPL Energy has began full operation of 2 large wind power plants, one
in Texas and the other in Washington.  FPL says the 278 MW King Mountain
Clean Energy Center near Odessa, and the 263 MW Stateline Clean Energy
Center near Walla Walla began operations last month. The two plants join 3
other wind power facilities FPL started in last year: 160 MW at Woodward
Mountain, also near Odessa, 112 MW in Gray County, Kansas, and 30 MW in
Monfort, Wisconsin. FPL Energy operates 1,830 MW and owns 1,439 MW of wind
power facilities in 8 states. FPL will continue to look for appropriate
sites for wind power development, but has expressed concern about the
future of the renewable energy source following the December 2001
expiration of the federal wind energy production tax credit.

PG&E Chromium Lawsuits Could Be Moved to Federal Court

    The judge presiding over Pacific Gas & Electric's bankruptcy will soon
rule on litigation connected to the 1993 case that led to the movie Erin
Brockovich. That case involved 650 people who were paid $333 million by
PG&E to settle claims they drank water containing chromium six, a
potential cause of cancer, near a Hinkley, CA natural gas pipeline station
owned by PG&E. The new claims involve 1,250 people seeking $500 million
for alleged personal injuries that are pending in 15 lawsuits involving
chromium at PG&E's Kettleman, Topock and Hinkley pipeline stations. PG&E
has said its potential liability is $160 million. Chromium six was used at
the pipeline stations in the 1950s and 1960s to prevent the pumps' cooling
systems from rusting then dumped in unlined ponds near the stations.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs say the chromium seeped into underground
water supplies and caused a number of illnesses, including cancer.
Although PG&E has said it used the chemical, it denies that chromium has
caused the illnesses. PG&E attorneys have said that bankruptcy law
mandates that personal injury and wrongful death claims be moved to a US
district court to ensure that the claims are handled as quickly and fairly
as possible. Plaintiffs attorneys contend that the suits were filed long
before the utility filed for bankruptcy and that moving them now to a
federal court would prolong the cases.

Mackenzie Delta Natural Gas Project Files for Approval

   A consortium of major oil companies have moved closer to developing
almost 6 Tcf of natural gas in the Mackenzie Delta region on the coast of
the Beaufort Sea. The group has begun the lengthy process of applying for
regulatory approval, which could take up to 4 years. Led by Imperial Oil,
the group consists of Conoco, Shell Canada, Exxon Mobil and now includes a
company controlled by Northwest Territories native people. The partners,
known as the Mackenzie Valley Producers Group, could spend up to C$250
million before they decide whether to proceed with the project. The
natural gas reserves would be produced from Imperial's 3 Tcf Taglu field,
the 1.8 Tcf Parsons Lake field, owned by Conoco and Exxon Mobil, and
Shell's 1 Tcf Niglintgak field. The project would include a pipeline to
carry up to 1 Bcf per day of natural gas to Alberta along the Mackenzie
River valley at a estimated cost of C$3 billion. The natural gas would
then be transported to Canada and the US. Last year, the group signed an
agreement with Northwest Territories native leaders that would give the
region's people a 33% share in the pipeline and provide other economic
benefits. Even if the Mackenzie Delta project did not start pumping for 5
or 6 years, it likely will still be ahead of the Alaskan project, where
BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips are planning development of their reserves.

Platts Says Natural Gas Prices Climb 12.6% in January

     Average monthly natural gas spot prices for January rose 12.6 % from
December, to $2.51 per MMBtu, but are 75% below the average reached in
January 2001, according to Platts. In a survey by Inside FERC's Gas Market
Report, the average price of natural gas delivered to the premium New York
and New Jersey markets for January was $4.92 per MMBtu compared with $3.12
per MMBtu in December and $19.33 per MMBtu last January. In Southern
California, the monthly average reached a high of $16.39 per MMBtu in
January 2001, the average monthly spot price for January 2002 climbed to
$2.62 per MMBtu, up 15.4% from $2.27 per MMBtu in December. The January
average is 84% below the January 2001 level. Monthly spot prices for
January climbed higher because weather was cold across most of the nation
at the close of December when most of the January deal making was
happening and because forecasts for the first part of January were for
more of the same. On January 4th, the average price for futures contracts
for the coming 12 months was $2.569 per MMBtu, down 9.25% from the $2.831
average on December 4th and 51% from the $5.241 average on April 4, 2001.

Dynedy Says FERC's New Market Power Proposal Too Risky

    All wholesale power transactions would be vulnerable to default if the
FERC adopts a strict new test for granting wholesale trading rights to
utilities, according to Dynegy.  Last Novermber, the FERC introduced a new
standard for sizing up market power for utilities big enough to influence
energy prices in their areas. The plan has raised a storm of protest from
many utilities. The proposed new market power test is based on the peak
power demand in any given area. If a company controls generation in any
area greater than its peak demand, FERC would require it to base rates on
per-unit production costs, not market-based rates. The previous
market-power test was any firm controlling more than 20% of supplies could
be subject to penalties. The new rules would call to question the finality
of all power market transactions and invite buyers to walk away from
purchase obligations, Dynegy says. About $100 billion in merchant
generation investment could be shelved if the FERC proceeds with a
proposed new rule, Dynegy warned saying all generation investment would be
exposed to a regulatory risk that did not exist before. In December, the
FERC delayed implementation of the new rules for several months until a
technical conference to give companies a chance to offer suggestions.
Dynegy says id the proposed new rules could also stunt the development of
renewable resources like wind, hydro and solar supplies by requiring them
to sell their power at no incremental cost. Entergy has also complained
that the FERC's sweeping changes are not justified by current laws. The
FERC is working to design 4 RTOs nationwide with built-in
market-monitoring capabilities which would negate the need for the new
market power rules. RTOs with approved monitoring systems will be exempt
from the new agency order.
-------------------------------------------------------------
ALL BAD NEWS SEEN IN THE MARKET According to a top industry analyst
traders are going to have to bide their time if they expect natural gas
prices to get much help from recovering industrial demand. Last week the
NAPM (National Association of Purchasing Managers) issued a positive
report concerning industrial activity, but natural gas traders showed
little interest. ""Industrial demand could be improving slowly, but what is
going on out there is overshadowed this time of year by weather
developments,"" says Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates. ""There
should be some indication of growing industrial demand. The stock market
is a leading indicator of industrial activity and those markets are
looking strong, and some of the other indices are looking OK, but for the
time being industrial activity is being buried by other overwhelmingly
bearish factors. The forecasts for industrial activity and what goes on in
the natural gas market seem to be a bit tenuous at best. for the next
couple of months the focus is going to be on the weather and once we get
to tne end of February, then the industry will focus on industrial
demand."" ""I do think that all the bad news may be presently factored into
the market. Even though there were new lows made early this week, I think
any low prices much below those levels are going to be difficult to
sustain,"" he said. GET YOUR FIVE WEEK FREE TRIAL TO GASTRADER NEWSLETTER.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

"TE Critical System Warning","November 25, 2001

Effective immediately, based on anticipated system operations and
weather conditions, as stated below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP
(Texas Eastern) is requiring that all customers take immediate and
prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts
to actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Easterns
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"AGT Critical System Warning","November 25, 2001

Based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, Algonquin
(AGT) is requesting that all customers take steps to eliminate excess
receipts and to conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries.  No Due
Pipe Payback gas will be scheduled through the end of November 2001.

AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations ?and revise
scheduled quantities? immediately to halt the further accumulation of
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

"Good-Bye","Hello.  I just wanted to tell some of my favorite people (to work with) that after today, Thursday, November 15th, I will no longer be part of the Regulatory Affairs Team.  I'm moving on to a different part of Enron, EES.  In fact, I officially start November 16th.

 I really enjoyed working with/and for you guys.  I've learned quite a bit from you all and I wanted to say Thanks.

Sincerely,

Melinda

"TE Capacity for length restricted","November 14, 2001

Weather forecasts would indicate low demand conditions through the
Thanksgiving Holiday's.  TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE) is facing high
line pack levels and full storage.  Thus the pipe has severely
restricted ability to absorb due-shipper gas.  Effective immediately,
and continuing through the end of the month, TE is requiring that:
     -    All shippers ensure their physical receipts do not exceed  physical
       deliveries.
     -    Receipt operators are expected to not flow above scheduled volumes.
     -    Delivery meters are expected to take all gas scheduled.
     -    Any customer who is long should take immediate action to resolve
       due-shipper positions.

No due-pipeline makeup gas may be scheduled. OBA parties should ensure
that physical takes match scheduled nominations. Due-shipper makeup gas
may be scheduled through your Operations Account Manager.  These
restrictions are expected to be in effect until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"TE Imbalance Resolution","January 4, 2002

Moderating weather conditions on the TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION (TE)
pipeline system will allow a limited amount of Due Shipper pay back to
be available over the weekend.  Shippers should schedule any imbalance
payback with their Operations Account Manager.

Customers that are in a Due Pipe position should be scheduling imbalance
makeup to the pipe through their Operations Account Manager.

All shippers and point operators should endeavor to stay balanced daily.
The opportunity to make up or pay back imbalances is entirely dependent
on the operating conditions of the pipe from day to day.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"AGT Critical System Warning","November 27, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) is requiring that all customers
take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and to
conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries.  This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been
scheduling gas in excess of actual takes. As a result, there is no line
pack available for system operational purposes and AGT cannot continue
to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.

AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations (and revise
scheduled quantities) immediately to halt the further accumulation of
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.

No due pipe imbalance makeup will be accepted until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

Natural Gas Futures Up Slightly in Lackluster Trading


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX contract
settled $0.007 up Friday at $2.275 per MMBtu on a day of lackluster trades
and boredom. The March contract gained $0.002 to $2.265 per MMBtu. The
market opened slightly higher but slowly worked it way lower before
recovering a little before the close. The market hit a marginal new low
but traded in a $0.02 - $0.03 range most of Friday, with low volumes
around 66,210. The lack of activity was expected after a large sell-off on
Thursday, with traders exhausting their positions after the AGA report.
The AGA reported a withdrawal of only 124 Bcf last week, considered low
and bearish, leaving over a Tcf more in storage than a year ago. The
market should continue softening slightly on lack of prolonged cold
weather and high storage volumes, but a technical rally lead by
short-covering funds is likely soon. The commitments of traders report
published Friday by the CFTC showed large speculators, including commodity
funds, held a net short position of 33,103 contracts last week, compared
with 26,874 the prior week. Big commercial players held a net long
position of 27,367, up from 21,258 a week earlier. They ended the week
with 336,717 longs and 309,350 shorts. This week, look for support at
December expiry levels of $2.18 of MMBtu, with resistance at $2.40  -
$2.45. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally down $0.10 - $0.20 Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $2.36 per MMBtu.

Companies Cut Planned Power Projects


    Power companies are cutting back on plans to build many new plants in
a reaction to sliding wholesale electricity prices and questions about
heavy corporate debt levels. About 18% of announced projects are defunct,
double the number of a year ago. The drop off could pose a threat to the
US after the current recession when demand for electricity picks up.
Enron's dramatic demise has hurt the power industry in recent months and
forced many to cut spending. Mirant, Dynegy and El Paso have all said they
would scale back some projects. Calpine is expected to make a similar
announcement later this month. Energy Insight reports that 91,139 MW of
generating plant, out of a total announced portfolio of 503,780 MW have
been scrapped or delayed by the end of 2001.

Unemployment Rate Rises for Oil and Natural Gas Drilling

    Lower oil and natural gas prices have taken their toll on the energy
exploration sector, which lost about 4,000 jobs in December according to
the Department of Labor. There were 336,000 oil and natural gas drilling
positions as of January 1st, about 6000 less jobs than the 3-year highs of
August and September, the DOL said. The US lost 124,000 jobs in December,
or 5.8%, but the unemployment rate fell from November, when 371,000 jobs
were lost. In 2001, the average crude oil price fell 14% to $25.96 per
barrel, but oil prices have risen since late December when OPEC and
non-member producers agreed to remove almost 2 million bpd from the global
oil market. Many have forecast a stronger market for oil and natural gas
prices in the 2nd quarter of this year, but the lost jobs will not return
until demand and prices rise. As is normal in the energy industry,
exploration jobs are usually the first to go when oil and natural gas
prices sink. Mostly unionized jobs in the petroleum and coal products
sector were stable at 127,000, but close to all time lows. The 4,000
positions eliminated by Enron last month are reflected in the securities
and commodity trading employment figures and account for more than a half
of that segment's jobless rate for December, according to DOL data.

Shares of Covanta Jump Higher

     Shares of Covanta jumped higher Friday after it had completed the
sale of most of an aviation fueling business as it seeks to focus on
independent power projects. The stock was up $0.44, or 8.9%, to $5.45 per
share. Covanta completed the sale of its aviation fueling operations at 19
airports in the US, Canada and Panama to Allied Aviation Holdings, a unit
of Tampa Pipeline for $15.2 million. Covanta also said Allied Aviation
Holdings would buy its aviation fueling operations at the three major New
York/New Jersey airports for an undisclosed price. This deal has been
delayed and there is no time frame for completion. Late last month Covanta
said it was seeking extra liquidity because of payment delays. The
statement, and investor fears about the prospects for power companies,
sent Covanta shares tumbling 60%.

PPL Cuts Earnings Forecasts


    PPL has said it plans to cancel 5 new power plants in Pennsylvania and
1 in Washington state and warned it will not meet earnings forecasts for
2001 and 2002. PPL canceled the projects worth $1.3 billion, which would
have added 2,100 MW of power, because of falling power prices and
regulatory conditions. The average price of electricity in PPL's main
market, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland fell 43% last quarter to
$25.80 per MWh from a year ago. The company will now spend about $1.5
billion on other power plant projects over the next 2 years. PPL has
lowered its 2001 and 2002 earnings estimates to $3.35 - $3.45 per share
from at least $4 per share. Power prices across the nation have fallen as
the recession and mild weather have reduced demand, leading many utilities
and power generators to cut back plans to build new generating plants. On
Friday, shares of PPL fell $2.56, more than 7% to $32.34, after dropping
by 23% last year. PPL is not alone as other power producers have canceled
or delayed plans for projects because of lower power prices and concern
that rising debt might hurt credit ratings. Its 2001 earnings were reduced
by $0.60 per share after canceling the purchase of 22 turbines from GE.
Earnings were also reduced about $0.14 per share after a write-off for a
share in the UK Teesside Power Station, partly owned by Enron. Profits
were further decreased by about $0.06 because of other business associated
with Enron.

Williams to Sell Convertibles


    Williams expects to sell $1 billion of securities automatically
convertible into company stock this week in a bid to shore up its balance
sheet following the collapse of Enron. Many energy providers have been
trying to improve their finances and increase investor confidence
following that bankruptcy. The sale of 3-year mandatory convertible
securities follows last month's $1.2 billion convertible securities sale
by Calpine. Williams' securities carry a rarely used structure that limits
the ability of investors to participate fully in a rise in Williams'
stock, but cushions that with a big dividend. The reason issuers in
general like mandatories is it helps their credit profiles, because there
is no principal coming due in 3 years. The benefit of a capped convertible
is there is a cap on the dollar value of the shares you need to issue if
the stock really runs higher. Williams will use proceeds as part of its
plan to fund capital spending, pay down short-term debt and pursue other
corporate purposes. Convertibles are stock-bond hybrids that usually offer
current income and can be converted into company stock.

Enron Removes Dabhol Components for Safe-Keeping


    After pulling out of India's Dabhol Power project, Enron has removed
key components necessary to restart the $3 billion power plant. Dabhol
said the parts were moved for security reasons so that they could be used
again when the power plant is sold. Dabhol, which laid off 300 workers
last month, says that the plant is surrounded by hostile people who relied
on the plant for their livelihood and that vandalism and theft occur
daily. The company wanted to keep the parts from being stolen or damaged.
A security staff of 80 guards protects the 1,700-acre site. Indian banks,
which have made $1.4 billion in loans to the plant, said the parts were
taken without their knowledge. Enron said it couldn't notify lenders of
the removal in time because of the holiday season. Dabhol says that the
parts are being stored outside India and would be returned once a sale is
completed. Tata Power, BSES and state-run Gas Authority of India have said
they plan to bid for the 740 MW plant. The lenders contacted Enron for an
explanation for the removal of the components, which included coded
compact discs and microchips. Enron owns 65% of the plant which was closed
down last May after cancelled a supply contract when the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board ran up $64 million in unpaid bills. An expansion plan to
add 1,444 MW to the existing generator and a 5 million-ton-per-year LNG
receiving terminal is 95% complete, but work has been halted pending a
sale. General Electric and Bechtel Group each own 10% of Dabhol.

"AGT Critical System Warning","November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, ALGONQUIN GAS TRANSMISSION (AGT) is requiring that all customers
take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess receipts and to
conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries.  This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather continues to be unseasonably mild and shippers have been
scheduling gas in excess of actual takes. As a result, there is no line
pack available for system operational purposes and AGT cannot continue
to absorb actual imbalances left on the system.

AGT will continue to closely monitor current pipeline conditions.  To
the extent necessary, AGT will contact customers on an individual basis
regarding additional action by AGT to protect system operations. AGT
recommends that all customers rank both their supplies and their markets
in the event that system-wide reductions are required.  To the extent
AGT and customers are unable to agree upon appropriate action within a
reasonable time, AGT may adjust customer's nominations (and revise
scheduled quantities) immediately to halt the further accumulation of
imbalances. In addition, AGT may take any actions within its operational
capabilities to reduce excess receipts.

No due pipe imbalance makeup will be accepted until further notice.

Please contact your Operations Account Manager if you have any
questions.

"TE Storage Inventory Levels","On  November 15, 2001, Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (""Texas  Eastern"")
notified firm storage customers that, as required by the Federal  Energy
Regulatory Commission's November 30, 1994 order, in Docket No.  RP95-15,
Texas  Eastern would monitor customer storage activity and  would  issue
customer-specific Operational Flow Orders (""OFOs"") prior to the issuance
of a system-wide storage OFO pursuant to Section 4.3  (L) of the General
Terms  and Conditions of Texas Eastern's  FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised
Volume No. 1    (""Tariff"").

As indicated in Texas Eastern's November 15, 2001 letter, the need for a
customer  specific  OFO  would be determined based  on  such  customer's
variance  from  the suggested storage withdrawal plan specified  in  the
November  15, 2001 mailing.  The Withdrawal Plan indicates  the  maximum
recommended storage withdrawals for each of four (4) withdrawal  periods
and  is  designed to reflect in the aggregate Texas Eastern's historical
utilization of its storage facilities prior to the implementation of the
Commission's Order No. 636

Texas Eastern is not issuing a Customer-Specific OFO at this time due to
the  high  aggregate storage position at 12/31/2001. Texas Eastern  will
continue to monitor individual customer storage activity and may need to
issue  customer-specific  OFOs  if  required  by  future  circumstances.
Customer-specific OFOs will be based upon each customer's variance  from
the suggested storage withdrawal plan provided to you and the other firm
storage customers by letter dated November 15, 2001.

If  you  have  any  questions  regarding the foregoing  matters,  please
contact your Account Manager.

Natural Gas Futures Continue Higher on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX continued higher
yesterday on more short-covering, gaining $0.041 to $2.291 per MMBtu. The
March contract rose $0.033 to $2.273 per MMBtu. The market opened higher
and traded range-bound bouncing off $2.32 several times as it awaits the
AGA storage report due out this afternoon. Look for a withdrawal about 150
- 160 Bcf reported for last week. Some say that since physical prices
maintained a premium to the NYMEX could be companies buying on the spot
market to keep from pulling stored natural gas that was pumped into the
ground at higher prices. If that is the case, a lower withdrawal and
subsequent price tumble could be in the offing. Physical prices gained
slightly yesterday on nominal cold in the West. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.03 - $0.07 higher
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.04
to $2.36 per MMBtu.

 EPA to Continue Utility Pollution Lawsuits

     The Bush administration plans to proceed with lawsuits against
several utilities for allegedly violating a Clean Air Act provision that
requires new pollution equipment when a plant is expanded or upgraded. The
Attorney General John says the EPA has a reasonable basis for continuing
the lawsuits initiated during the Clinton administration. In November
1999, the Clinton Justice Department sued many coal fired utilities for
expanding or upgrading plants without installing modern equipment required
to control smog, acid rain and soot. It sought to strictly enforce the
Clean Air Act's new source review rules, which exempt power plants and oil
refineries built before 1977 from installing modern pollution controls
unless major modifications are made to the plants. The industry has
bitterly opposed the pollution rule. It claims the regulations prevented
more refineries and power plants from being expanded or upgraded and
limited energy supplies.

LONGER TERM TRADERS SEEK BUYING OPPORTUNITIES

 ""I think that $1.80 to $2.00 is rock solid support, and any long position
you want to put on you do that against $2.00,"" said John Beaver, president
Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  ""I really wonder if the market is
ever going to get to $2.00, but if it does get that low I don't think it
will spend much time there. The industry will work through this storage,
the rig count is down, and all those factors. Prices will form a base down
near these levels, and once the storage is worked through, prices will
take off, but it may be July with hurricanes and heat waves,"" said Beaver.

Andersen Fires Partner in Charge of Enron Audits


    Arthur Andersen has fired the partner in charge of Enron Corp's audits
for ordering the destruction of thousands of e-mails and documents related
to Enron. In addition to the firing of the chief Enron auditor, Andersen
said it will place 3 other partners involved in Enron's accounting on
leave and is relieving 4 other partners of their management
responsibilities. The accounting firm says they will put a new management
team in place in their Houston office. Anderson said that the destruction
of Enron documents at its Houston office was on such a scale and of such a
nature as to remove any doubt that Andersen's policies and reasonable good
judgment were violated. The SEC, Justice Department and Congress are
investigating the disposal of e-mails and documents related to Enron as
part of larger probe of Enron's meltdown. Andersen said the document
destruction ended a day after the SEC subpoenaed Andersen's records. House
Commerce Committee investigators believe the fired partner and others
involved in Enron's audit received approval to destroy documents from
Andersen's headquarters in an October 12th memo. But Anderson denied the
allegation, saying that the partner expedited efforts to destroy documents
without consulting others in the firm. Questions have been raised about
whether Enron-related litigation will exceed Andersen's liability
insurance.

Maine PUC Selects New Standard Offer Power Provider

    The Maine PUC hopes to save standard offer electricity customers
nearly $100 million a year. The PUC said that when market prices fall, as
they have during the past year, they will pass those savings along to
business customers with standard offer service, which is the default
energy supplier for those who have not chosen another provider. The
commission accepted bids for new standard offer prices for medium and
large commercial customers in the Central Maine Power and Bangor
Hydro-Electric service areas. The new prices are 41% to 49% below current
standard offer prices, the PUC said. The new standard offer prices for
Central Maine medium and large commercial customers average about $0.042
per kWh. Bangor Hydro prices average $0.042 per kWh for medium and $0.04
per kWh for large customers. Central Maine is a unit of Energy East and
Bangor Hydro is owned by Canadian company Emera. Large and medium standard
offer customers account for about 30% of the load, or about 6.8 million
MW/h per year. The PUC said it selected a one-year contract period to
ensure standard offer prices are in line with the market while maintaining
the competitiveness of the market. The commission said it would release
the names of the provider selected in 2 weeks to allow supply arrangements
to be completed.

Mirant Shares Continue to Tumble


    Shares of Mirant fell for a 7th consecutive day yesterday, hitting a
record low amid speculation of loss of trading business after its credit
rating was cut to junk status last month. The stock dropped $0.77, down
5.9% to $12.21 per share after earlier dipping to $11.80. It has tumbled
24% since January 4th. Mirant CEO claims the company is still doing strong
business and intends to meet with Moody's this week to discuss the
downgrade. Moody's downgraded Mirant to 'Ba1' its highest junk rating,
from lowest investment grade 'Baa2'. Moody's also says the rating outlook
remained negative. A day after the rating cut, Mirant sold stock, raising
$759 million, and said it will shed assets and cut capital spending by
40%.

Details of Enron - UBS Warburg Agreement


   Enron and UBS Warburg, the investment banking group of UBS, have agreed
to a deal for Enron's North American Gas and electric trading operation
that entitles Enron to a third of the profits generated by the new 'AA+'
rated trading entity. It is a positive deal for Enron and its creditors
that confirms the substantial value of Enron's trading operation. Enron
sees it as the first step among many towards an overall plan of
reorganization and planned emergence from bankruptcy. The deal is for ten
years but allows UBS Warburg a series of options to begin buying out
Enron's royalty interest in the 3rd year of the agreement. UBS Warburg's
calls may be exercised in 3 steps, each representing a third of the
royalty stream. Following the exercise of the first call, the royalty
payment rate will drop from 33% to 22%; following the exercise of the
second call, the royalty payment rate will drop from 22% to 11%.  Upon the
exercise of the third call, the remaining 11% royalty would cease.  The
complete transaction documents is available at: www.enron.com .

Others Scarf Up Enron Market Share

    Duke, Mirant, the Intercontinental Exchange and other energy traders
are taking up the slack created by Enron's bankruptcy. Mirant, BP and
Goldman Sachs are among a consortium of businesses that own ICE, whose
energy trades have climbed by 60% since Enron's problems. ICE's owners
account for 40% of the energy market, double EnronOnline's 20% before it
halted trading. The exchange said trading through its online marketplace
for energy products and metals, jumped to $4.3 billion last week up from
December's record high daily average of $2.5 billion. Mirant has seen its
power and natural gas trades increase about 10% to 15%. Duke said its
energy trading volumes have also risen. Enron once handled about 25% of
electricity and natural gas trades and had $100 billion in revenue in
2000, mainly from energy trading. UBS, the largest Swiss bank, was chosen
to buy Enron's trading business for a share of future profits, no cash up
front and the bank will assume none of Enron's liabilities. Enron hopes
that the UBS deal will revive its trading business.

Wind Industry Sets Records in 2001

    The wind energy industry left previous records in the dust with a
blowout year in 2001, installing nearly 1,700 MW, or $1.7 billion worth of
new generating equipment in 16 states, according to the American Wind
Energy Association. The final tally of 1,694 MW was more than double the
previous record year of 1999, when 732 MW was installed, and boosted the
industry's total generating capacity by more than 60% over the amount in
place a year earlier. Current installed capacity in the US is now 4,258
MW, and there are wind turbine installations in 26 states.  However,
prospects for a repeat in 2002 have been thrown into doubt by the
expiration of a key incentive, the federal wind production tax credit,
which expired December 31st and was not renewed by Congress, due to a
partisan battle over economic stimulus legislation.  Bills to renew the
PTC had strong support in both the House of Representatives and Senate,
AWEA said, but were left unpassed when negotiations between the two
parties on the economic legislation broke down shortly before Christmas.

"Summary Exit Entitlements Granted by Yankee","Jay, the spreadsheet has a summary of the exit and operational entitlements that TETCO has provided Enron that Yankee has granted. Assuming that you do not wish to modify the two smaller release offers, I have provided you exactly what needs to be done to modify the larger release offer.

It is important that the releases grant us the minimal exit entitlements by production zone to M1 per our previous conversations. I will be out of the office on Monday. However, Judy Townsend and Ruth Concannon are familiar with this deal structure. Judy is most familiar with the current issues. I will be visiting with Ruth early on Monday.  Judy gets to the office earlier than Ruth. She will be able to answer any questions. However, she trades until 11:00  AM CST so she will not be able to spend as much time with you in the morning. 

I will give you a call from the road around 9:00 AM.

We will get this done together...Thanks!!!

Natural Gas Futures Drop on Technicals


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.14
yesterday to $2.254 per MMBtu after locals battled funds and lost. The
March contract lost $0.109 to $2.254 per MMBtu. There was a technical
strategy from large marketing firms to bid up the contract in an attempt
to chase funds out of their short positions, however, it blew up in their
face. The locals wound up long and had to sell-off rapidly. The market
opened strong, hitting a high of $2.405 per MMBtu on the strength of an
AGA report that lowered the year-on-year surplus, but then quickly dropped
below $2.25. Open interest increased by 9,689 contracts Wednesday to
464,452 contracts, in what by yesterday morning indicated a contrived
effort to sell up the market. Look for resistance at $2.36 and support at
$2.20, $2.125 and $2.02. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US
and Canada generally flat to up $0.05 per MMBtu yesterday. Without much
cold weather moving either market, the spread between futures and cash
stayed at $0.03 - $0.05 without much movement. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.03 to $2.33 per MMBtu.

 PG&E Claims California Owes It Billions


    Pacific Gas & Electric has filed a $4.1 billion damage claim against
California for allegedly breaking a regulatory contract to let it sell
power at prices set by the FERC. The claim stems from the 1996 law that
deregulated the state's power market and helped trigger California's
energy crisis. PG&E says that under the law, it agreed to divest most of
its in-state power plants to increase competition in the local electricity
market. In return, the state would allow PG&E's remaining hydroelectric
and nuclear plants to sell power at market prices overseen by the FERC.
That would end the California PUC's authority to set prices, and shifting
regulatory oversight to FERC's less stringent system of managing prices.
PG&E says the market value of its power was not less than $4.1 billion. It
also says that under an emergency energy bill passed last January, the
state broke the agreement for FERC regulation. The state board has 45 days
to reply to the claim.

Westchester County, NY Battles Millennium Pipeline


    Westchester County, north of New York City, will petition the FERC to
reconsider its decision to permit Columbia Gas to build the 530-mile
Millennium pipeline from Ontario to Mount Vernon, NY. The pipeline would
transport 700,000 Mcf per day to New York City and southern parts of the
state. The county alleges that the FERC prematurely granted Columbia's
request to build the pipeline. They say that Columbia does not have the
needed state approvals to proceed with construction and that the company
did not provide crucial information about using dynamite to blast in
environmentally sensitive areas in the Hudson River. A FERC study found
that the pipeline would have limited adverse environmental impact and was
the preferred alternative to deliver natural gas to New York. The
commission has 30 days to respond to the county's petition. If denied,
Westchester can then seek a court order to block construction. The county
has asked several state regulatory departments to deny future approvals
and cancel existing permits already granted. Westchester will also refuse
to grant Columbia permits for construction on county land. Additionally,
the county is questioning whether the pipeline violates a state plan to
protect coastal areas from environmental damage. Federal law prohibits a
federal agency from granting approval for projects that affect the
coastline if a state finds it violates its own coastal plan. In addition,
county officials have asked the governor to intervene when he attends a
FERC conference later this month.

Enron Paid Very Few Taxes


    Enron's use of Caribbean tax havens to legally shelter profits
reflects the power Washington lobbyists have in creating tax havens for
the rich and powerful. Offshore tax havens among the small islands of the
Caribbean have been used for years by individual investors, companies,
drug traffickers and money launderers to hide cash. But the disclosure
that Enron paid no income taxes in 4 of the last 5 years by using 900
subsidiaries in tax-haven countries and other techniques kept its US tax
bill a next to nothing. Enron used 881 subsidiaries abroad, including 692
in the Cayman Islands and 119 in the Turks and Caicos, and other legal
tax-avoidance techniques common to major companies to zero-out US tax
bills. The Cayman Islands, a tiny British colony of 35,000 residents just
south of Cuba, is one of the world's leading financial centers with some
600 banks and thousands of foreign corporations.

Andersen Memo Details Meeting on Enron


   A February 6, 2001 Andersen memo detailing a executive meeting where
the amount of debt kept off Enron's books was discussed has surfaced.
Andersen said the meeting was just a standard annual review of Enron. The
executives discussed whether Anderson should drop Enron as a client, and
also talked about how key the off balance sheet transactions were to
understanding the energy firms finances. It has also been revealed that
Andersen was warned of trouble at Enron last summer by the same executive
who sent Kenneth Lay a memo detailing her concerns over the company's
financial practices. The Enron executive then raised those same concerns
in a conversation with an unidentified Andersen partner. Andersen was
assured by Enron that an outside law firm had been hired to look into the
allegations. The memo is likely to lead to questions about the role of
accountants and the steps they take before signing sign off on a company's
financial statements. The chairman of the SEC is expected to announce a
new accounting oversight panel to include accountants and non-accountants,
possibly similar to the Public Oversight Board.

Recession and Mild Weather Lower Dukes Profits


    Duke says 4th quarter profits dropped 21% due to lower energy prices,
mild weather and the recession. Earnings fell to $225 million, or $0.28
per share, from $284 million, or $0.38 a year ago. Revenue was off 30% to
$10.7 billion from $15.4 billion the year before. Duke's field services
unit, which processes natural gas liquids saw its earnings tumble 34%
because of lower prices. The company's electric utilities, which provided
more than 30% of its earnings, fell 41% as moderate temperatures and a
drop in industrial demand ate into power sales. Duke's power sales slid
7.6% in the quarter for residential customers and 9.5% for industrial
customers, the company said. Natural gas prices plunged 59% from a year
earlier and wholesale power prices in Duke's service region fell by 50% to
about $25 per MWh. Duke also said that it took a charge for special items
totaling  $46 million, or $0.06 per share, to reflect accounting
adjustments at its utilities and exposure to losses from dealings with
Enron. Excluding the one-time charge, profit was $271 million, or $0.34
per share. The average of analysts estimates was $0.45 per share. The
company remains optimistic that it can achieve 10% - 15% growth this year.
Duke's revenue last year was $59.5 billion compared to $49.3 billion in
2000. More than half of its natural gas and power contracts hedged through
2004.

ISO Merger Talks Continue in Northeast and Midwest

   Merger talks are underway in the Northeast and Midwest to consolidate
control of large parts of those grids. The New York ISO is in discussions
with ISO New England to form a regional transmission organization between
the two grid operators. The talks currently do not include the PJM
Interconnection, which last week announced that it reached a letter of
intent to create a single market with the Midwest ISO. The FERC has a
pending decision on Northeastern RTO formation, based on confidential
mediation discussions from last summer that were aimed at developing a
business plan to create a single Northeast RTO. It expects to release the
results of its own cost-benefit analysis of forming a single Northeastern
RTO next month, but has not decided on the size and numbers of RTOs in the
region. Also, former members of the Alliance RTO are in negotiations to
form an independent entity within the existing Midwest ISO. The
discussions concern a FERC rulemaking session last month that declared the
Midwest ISO to be the single RTO for the region, saying that the Alliance
did not meet its conditions.

Accenture Now Glad Andersen Name Lost

   About a year ago consulting firm Accenture was called Andersen
Consulting, but lost a bitter fight with its sister firm, Arthur Andersen,
to retain the brand name of Andersen. Now, the name loss looks like manna
from Heaven, as the once fabled Andersen name sinks in the Enron quagmire.
Once one of the pillars of accounting, the Andersen name is now only
associated with the Enron debacle. That is very different from the
scenario that prevailed during the bitter battle between the accounting
firm and its consulting arm. A Paris mediator ruled in Andersen's favor in
August 2000. That was a seen as a huge victory for the accounting firm.
The dispute began when Andersen Consulting, which had seen its profits
soar with the booming economy, felt it was not being paid enough for its
work. Ultimately, Andersen Consulting won independence, but was forced it
to relinquish the Andersen brand name. Be careful what you ask for, you
might not really want it after all.

Canadian Drilling to Drop this Year

    The Petroleum Services Association of Canada says that Western
Canadian producers expect to cut drilling by 26% this year and natural gas
will continue to dominate exploration activity. It predicts 13,386 wells
will be drilled in western Canada, down from last year's record 18,024.
Natural gas will account for 8,189, or 61%, of its forecast well
completions this year. PSAC expects 10,309 wells to be drilled in Alberta,
down 26% from 2001; 2,323 wells in Saskatchewan, a 25% drop; and 674 in
northeastern British Columbia, down 29%. There were 11,177 natural gas
completions last year in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, with
another 26 natural gas wells drilled in the East Coast offshore.

                  NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                        JANUARY 19, 2001


SUBJECT:  NOTICE TO PARTIES DELIVERING OR CAUSING GAS TO BE DELIVERED TO        
   COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY

Pursuant to Section 25.2(a) of Columbia's tariff, Columbia is providing notice 
of the imposition of the following additional gas quality specification on all 
shippers, interconnecting pipelines, producers, and receipt meter operators, 
and all other parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into Columbia's 
system:

     All gas tendered under Columbia's tariff shall have a gross heating value  
    of no more than 1050 Btu per cubic foot.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days 
after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.  


In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all 
parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated 
Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on 
the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence 
to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant 
to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating 
value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be 
required upon Columbia's request.  

Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set 
forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas 
processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in 
Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding 
redeliveries.

Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any 
party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from 
its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set 
forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of 
the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering 
Columbia's system.

Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing 
this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its 
reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may 
occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas 
quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional 
gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being 
received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's 
pipeline system and its operations. 

You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and 
seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu 
gas.

Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761, 
or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.

Natural Gas Futures End Choppy Day Down

     Natural gas for March delivery on the NYMEX ended down $0.021
yesterday at $2.117 per MMBtu. The April contract slipped $0.014 to $2.184
per MMBtu. The market opened lower, but bounced off $2.08. However, it
could not get higher than $2.15, and failed to trigger anticipated buy
stops above $2.17. Every rally is hit with a wave of selling. Look for the
market to open lower again this morning. The AGA reports last week's
storage information tomorrow afternoon. Expect a withdrawal of about 120
Bcf - 130 Bcf. Last week, 111 Bcf was withdrawn leaving 2.294 Tcf in
storage. The nation's storage facilities are still 70% full compared to
38% full a year ago. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to plus or minus $0.05 yesterday. Physical
prices jumped higher in the Northeast. Utilities reportedly nominated
base-loads for every day for February, intending to use the spot market
only as weather dictates. Cash prices held as much as $0.08 - $0.09 above
the NYMEX. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub ended flat
at $2.18 per MMBtu.

WSJ Says Enron Officials Knew About Chewco Partnership

     Top Enron executives, including Chairman Lay and former CEO Jeffrey
Skilling, knew about the controversial partnerships, according to the Wall
Street Journal, citing minutes from a November 5, 1997 meeting. Former CFO
Andrew Fastow and several board members including external director
Herbert Winokur Jr were also at the meeting that discussed Enron's
partnership Chewco, named for the Star Wars character Chewbacca. Chewco,
which was supposed to be completely independent, but was run and partly
owned by Enron executive Michael Kopper, who also attended the meeting.
Federal investigators and private litigants are trying to find out who
knew what about Chewco and when. An attorney for Winokur says the
executive committee was told that Chewco was a special-purpose vehicle not
affiliated with the company. The board never waived the
conflict-of-interest policy for Kopper nor was the board told that Kopper
was involved with Chewco.

Lay Breaks Date with Congress After Report Issued


    Enron attempted to systematically manipulate its financial results and
deceive shareholders as top executives made personal gains of millions of
dollars, according to William Powers, dean of the University of Texas Law
School in testimony to be delivered before Congress yesterday. There was
also failures in the performance of Enron's outside advisors. And there
was a fundamental default of leadership and management, starting with
former CEO Ken Lay and reaching to the board and senior managers. As
Congress begins a week of hearings, the House Financial Services capital
markets subcommittee also heard from SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt. Powers
joined the Enron board to investigate events leading up to the company
filing for bankruptcy on December 2nd. He has issued a 218-page report
that found Enron fattened its profits by almost $1 billion through a web
of financial partnerships used to hide losses, while top managers made
millions of dollars they should never have received. He laid some of the
blame for on Lay and of Jeffrey Skilling. Powers said former ex-Enron CFO
Andrew Fastow made at least $30 million, while former senior executive
Michael Kopper made at least $10 million through their involvement in
off-the-books partnerships. Enron's board of directors failed in its duty
to provide leadership and oversight and in the end, the tragedy could and
should have been avoided, Powers said. After the report was released, Lay
canceled plans to testify before a Senate committee and before the capital
markets subcommittee.

AEP May Sell Some Foreign Assets


    American Electric Power may sell Seeboard, which serves 2 million
power and natural gas users in the UK, and CitiPower, an Australian retail
and distribution unit, to lower debt as it switches its focus to wholesale
markets and away from household power supply. Like Reliant and Mirant, AEP
is selling foreign assets to protect its credit ratings. Enron's
bankruptcy has caused many energy companies to slash capital spending and
sell assets to lower debt. AEP has $2.6 billion in debt maturing in the
next 2 years. Seeboard is valued at about $2.1 billion and CitiPower at as
much as $760 million. AEP, which acquired Seeboard in a $10 billion buyout
of C&SW, said will consider all potential options for Seeboard. AEP's 4th
quarter earnings fell 41% due to mild weather. It is selling common stock
and convertible preferred shares to raise cash and shore up its balance
sheet. Last year, AEP sold Yorkshire Power in the UK and purchased 2 power
stations. AEP has also been expanding its energy trading business after
Enrons collapse. It bought Enron's Scandinavian businesses and hired 22
coal traders from Enron. Seeboard is likely to fetch a good price since it
is the only supply business for sale in the UK. E.ON, Electricite de
France and Scottish & Southern Energy have been named as likely bidders
for Seeboard. CitiPowers sale will probably happen in the 3rd quarter,
according to AEP. Possible buyers could be Australian Gas Light, United
Energy and Origin Energy. AEP bought the retail and distribution company
for $1.1 billion in 1998.

Williams May Sell Midwest Oil Products Pipeline


    Williams may sell its 8,000-mile Midwest oil products pipeline and
storage depots for between $500 million and $1.5 billion, to help defray
costs from possible exposure to $2.4 billion from Williams Communications.
Last week, Williams postponed the release of 4th quarter results to review
costs associated with Williams Communications Group, which was spun off in
April. Williams said that those costs will be included in the 4th quarter
earnings report. Williams Energy Partners which is 60% owned by Williams
has been mentioned as a likely buyer for the pipeline. Williams has sold
securities and cut capital spending to shore up its balance sheet amid
heavier scrutiny by credit rating agencies following Enron's bankruptcy.
Williams' 7.5% coupon bonds maturing in 2031 were down about $44 to $879
per $1,000 face value from $923 last week, with the spread above US
Treasuries climbing to 330 basis points from 285. None of the rating
agencies has downgraded Williams debt yet, but S&P has says it may lower
Williams' ratings because of concern about the company's finances. S&P
rates Williams 'BBB+', Moody's rates it 'Baa2' and Fitch rates it as
'BBB', all investment grade. Williams is aiming complete the Midwest
pipeline sale by the end of the 2nd quarter. Net income for Williams
Energy Partners more climbed to $21.7 million from $3 million a year ago.

partnership has $140 million in private debt. Williams said its 4th
quarter loss had widened and its banks have warned that the it may be in

Lay Makes Himself Scarce


    A congressional committee trying to serve a subpoena on former Enron
Chairman Ken Lay can not seem to locate him. His personal attorney does
not know where he is and would not accept the subpoena. The House of
Representatives Financial Services Committee finds the whole situation
quiet puzzling. Lay's attorney says he is ill and has no idea where Lay
is. Lay resigned from Enron's board yesterday as two congressional
committees vowed to force him to come before them to testify or take the
5th Amendment. He had been scheduled to appear before a House Financial
Services subcommittee, but backed out over the weekend. It had hoped to
compel him to appear today. Lay had also been scheduled to appear before a
Senate committee, but canceled that date also.

TRADERS DEBATE SHORT SIDE OF MARKET

   Although Monday's price action on the New York Mercantile Exchange is
perhaps best described as lackadaisical, some traders see inspiration to
take the short side of the market where others are focusing on a longer
term trend higher.  ""When the March contract expired (January 29), it got
as low as $1.97 and developed a modest countertrend higher. As long as the
market was able to continue trading above the previous day's low, that
advance worked well,"" noted Dean Hazelcorn, trader with Coquest, Dallas.
""Today looks like a sell signal. The high of the March contract did not
exceed Friday's high and today's low was lower. That sets up a trade down
to $1.97. I look for a slow deteriorating front end of the board,"" he
noted.  ""I'm back in a bearish mode, and I think we're headed below $2.00.
I believe that there is a 99% probability the market will work lower, but
it may take 3 months to do it,"" he cautioned.  Other traders are more
optimistic.  ""Longer term I'm bullish,"" says John Beaver, President
Private Futures Group, Oklahoma City.  ""It's more difficult to be bullish
on the front of the board, but looking at the charts it suggests that
prices may be set to rise.  There's a gap on the weekly chart between
$2.17 and $2.20 on the weekly chart (week ending January 18, and January
25). and if prices could fill that gap, it would be a positive sign that
prices were set to move higher,"" he said.  A gap is a pattern on the price
charts followed by market technicians. The idea is that the gap may act as
a barrier to (in this case) further price advances. Once the gap is
""filled"", however, a potential limitation to price advances has been
removed and prices would be empowered to move higher.  ""I don't have any
interest in being short the market at the $2.00 level. I don't want to be
in a trade that may only make 10 or 15 cents and have to worry about it,""
he said.  ""If you are a commercial trader are you going to get short at
$1.85? What is your board of directors going to say?""

Natural Gas Futures Dip But Hold Above $2


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dipped briefly
below $2 per MMBtu Friday, but bounced back on short-covering and funds
rolling to end the day down $0.011 at $2.037 per MMBtu. The March contract
gained $0.014 to $2.104 per MMBtu. The market began the session lower and
gradually works its way higher most of the day, holding inside only a
$0.05 range. Funds continued rolling positions into March and April
contracts and beyond, and marketers braced themselves for February's
expiration tomorrow. Although the market is making an effort to stay above
$2.00, it made a lower high, a lower low and closed lower for the day and
the week. So look for the market to continue down this week unless colder
weather is forecast. Also expect to see an even smaller withdrawal this
week from storage of about 110 - 120 Bcf. However, there is a chance for
limited short-covering into expiration as the market continues to be
oversold technically. On Friday, estimated volume was about 90,000
contracts, with about 40,000 of those spreads or hedge trades. Natural gas
for weekend delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.05 - $0.15
lower Friday, Natural gas for weekend delivery at the Henry hub dropped
$0.09 to $2.03 per MMBtu.

S&P Changes Ratings Process


    Standard & Poor's is changing the way it rates companies, in part
because of problems from the demise of Enron. S&P is likely to conduct
more formal reviews of ratings, and will be more specific about how far a
rating may fall in the event of a review for downgrade. It will also focus
more on credit cliff situations, which could result in a precipitous
decline in a company's ratings if certain events take place. It will
require companies to publicize rating triggers, such as one that in
November could have forced Enron to pay off a $690 million note because of
a recent downgrade. S&P is considering how best to incorporate securities
price movements into ratings. S&P rates companies on a sliding scale from
'AAA' to 'D'. Moody's Investors Service and Fitch are also considering
changes to make their own rating activity more timely.

Exelon Reduces Net Income on Accounting Error

  Exelon 3rd quarter net income was 6.7% lower than reported in October
because of an accounting error. Net income was $376 million, or $1.16 per
share, not $403 million, or $1.25 per share. That means Exelon's 3rd
quarter profit rose 62% from $232 million, or $1.35 per share, a year
earlier. The company had a bigger than expected loss in a trust fund that
has money for dismantling nuclear generators after they are closed. The
fund is not managed by Exelon. Exelon will report 4th quarter and 2001
financial results tomorrow. It probably earned about $4.30 - $4.45 last
year.

Former Enron Vice Chairman Apparently Commits Suicide


    Former Enron Vice Chairman John Clifford Baxter, who had opposed the
accounting practices that led to the downfall of the energy trading giant,
apparently took his own life early Friday morning. Police said that Baxter
was dead at the scene and the only occupant of the car. A suicide note and
a revolver were found at the scene. Baxter was chairman and CEO of Enron
North America before being named chief strategy officer. In October of
2000, he was promoted to vice chairman. Baxter resigned last May after ten
years with Enron, during which time he helped build its wholesale energy
business. Baxter had disagreed with then CEO Jeffrey Skilling over the
inappropriateness of off-balance-sheet transactions involving partnerships
that ultimately brought the company down. Baxter was one of the Enron
directors targeted in about 40 investor lawsuits which allege that the
company concealed losses by the use of the partnerships. Baxter engineered
the $3.21 billion purchase of Portland General Electric in 1997. Enron has
agreed to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas for $2.98 billion in
cash, stock and debt. Baxter resigned after losing a battle with Skilling
for control of the direction the company would take. He favored the
acquisition of energy producing assets to build the company, while
Skilling preferred to expand the commodities trading unit, in Enron's
asset light theory. Baxter reportedly told friends that he planned to earn
a Ph.D. in history, spend time with his family and look for a position as
chief executive at another company.

Dabhol Sale Process Begins This Week


    The bidding process for Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power project in
India is set to begin this week. The Industrial Development Bank of India
said advertisements will be placed in newspapers. Interested foreign
companies are Royal Dutch/Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential
Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India.
Reportedly Rothschild, DSP Merrill Lynch and Smifs Securities have been
appointed to search for bidders. The vast 2,184 MW natural gas fired power
plant and nearby LNG facility, the largest foreign private investment ever
in India, has been idle since Enron pulled out last June in a dispute over
the cost of the power provided to its only customer, the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board. The 740 MW first phase of Dabhol began operating in May
1999. A 1,444 MW 2nd phase was almost complete when construction was
halted after the state electricity board fell $240 million behind in
payments for power provided. Those interested in acquiring the plant must
put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest money. The sellers intend to
sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may bid jointly for the operation
and split it up later. A London data room will be established for the
commercial and financial agreements, operating and historical data,
projections and information on the status of Phase II. Due diligence is
expected to begin early next month, with a possible deadline of the middle
of March for submitting offers. The US government's Overseas Private
Investment Corporation, a lender and guarantor of  loans to the project,
and IDBI have led the talks among the parties involved, including 5 Indian
financial institutions, 20 foreign banks, 3 foreign government lending
agencies, several governments, equity holders and potential bidders. Enron
owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own 10% and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%.

California PUC Rejects Sempra Settlement

    The California PUC has rejected a settlement proposed by Sempra Energy
that seeks to split profits from power sales between customers of San
Diego Gas and Electric and shareholders. The decision will likely lead to
a lawsuit between Sempra and the PUC. At stake is $363 million the PUC
argues could be used to the benefit of customers by paying down a special
balancing account set up during the California's energy crisis last year
that captured the difference between retail prices state regulators
allowed SDG&E to charge and soaring wholesale power prices. To cash in on
the high prices, SDG&E sold all the electricity remaining on several
5-year power contracts it had signed in 1996 and 1997, pocketing the
profit..

Alberta Energy and PanCanadian Consider Merger


    PanCanadian Energy Will buy Alberta Energy in a $16.8 billion share
exchange deal which will create North America's largest oil exploration
and production company, replacing Anadarko. The deal will allow the
companies to compete effectively on a global basis. The new company, which
is to be headquartered in Calgary, will be named EnCana Corp. The exchange
ratio is a market-to-market ratio based on the average of the closing
price for the 10 trading days ended January 23rd. PanCanadian shareholders
will own about 54% and AEC shareholders will own about 46% of EnCana.
Combined, the stocks of the two companies make up 44% of the TSE's oil and
gas sub-index. Some say that Canadian companies have realized the need to
bulk up in order to be competitive with larger companies in the US, like
Anadarko, Burlington Resources and Devon Energy, and to attract investors.
The deal could also be a self-protection measure in response to last
year's rash of takeovers of Canadian oil firms by US companies, like those
that took over Gulf Canada, Anderson Exploration and Canadian Hunter.
Alberta Energy and PanCanadian may have seen themselves as vulnerable to
possible takeovers. PanCanadian had been considered a possible takeover
target when it was spun off from Canadian Pacific in October. A new
AEC-PanCanadian company would produce 255,000 bpd of oil and natural gas
liquids and 2.5 Bcf of natural gas per day. PanCanadian has natural gas
and oil production facilities in Western Canada and offshore operations in
Nova Scotia, the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea, where it recently
discovered the areas largest oil field in 10 years, named Buzzard. AEC
also produces oil and natural gas in Western Canada, owns about 14% of the
Syncrude Canada oil sands project and has exploration, production,
pipeline and natural gas storage units in the Rocky Mountains, Ecuador and
the Arctic.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Natural Gas Futures Rally on AGA Report

    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.103
higher yesterday to $2.394 per MMBtu. The March contract gained $0.09 to
$2.363 per MMBtu. The market began the day up and pushed higher after a
137 Bcf withdrawal was reported by the AGA in the afternoon. The storage
report was about what was expected, but was 37 Bcf more than a year ago.
However, it barely dented the record amounts of inventory remain in
storage, about 2.529 Tcf, at 77% full compared to 44% full last year at
this time at 1.459 Tcf. The 5-year average is 2 Tcf. The rally broke
through the $2.36 resistance level. Funds are holding record-high short
positions and could cause a major technical rally if they ever had to
cover. But, more likely the market will head back down as the fundamentals
takeover. Support is seen at $2.36, $2.32 and $2.25 per MMBtu. A cold
front expected to move into eastern states next week and could cause the
market to rally again, but the increase will be difficult to sustain.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally
flat to $0.05 higher yesterday. Natural gas for next delivery at the hub
gained $0.03 to $2.39 per MMBtu.

utility in a bid to topple the company's reorganization plan. The ads
reprinted a recent letter to the employees of Pacific Gas and Electric
from the chairman and chief executive of the parent company. He wrote that
the lawsuit by the California Attorney General contained false and
unwarranted accusations. The lawsuit charges that PG&E drained cash from
the utility during the California power emergency to fund new businesses
and drove the company into bankruptcy and seeks damages of $600 million to
$4 billion. The attorney general and the PUC are working to derail the
utilitys reorganization plan because they don't want to lose regulatory
jurisdiction over the company, the ad said. The plan would shift the
utility's power generation and energy transmission systems to new
companies formed by PG&E and beyond state jurisdiction.

Calpine Revises 2001 and 2002 Earnings Estimates

    Calpine has lowered its earnings estimates for 2001 and 2002. It now
expects profits of $1.95 per share for 2001 compared to estimates of $2.00
per share. For 2002, it expects earnings of $1.70 per share versus
estimates of $2.20 per share. Even though Calpine lowered its estimate for
2001, it will see its profits rise by 63% above 2000 earnings. Calpine
also revised its capital spending budget downward by $2 billion saying it
will complete 27 power projects, accounting for 15,200 MW, which are
currently being built. Another 34 projects in the advanced development
stage will be on hold until demand for power increases. It is also
negotiating with major equipment suppliers to adjust payment schedules and
revise delivery timing in line with its new construction schedule.
Calpine, Mirant and other power generators have delayed or canceled
billions of dollars in projects in an attempt to bolster credit ratings
and reassure investors. Last month, Moody's lowered Calpine's credit
rating to junk and said it remained on review for further possible
downgrades. Calpine has raised almost $5 billion in the last 3 months,
including a $2.6 billion bond sale. Its current generating capacity is
11,100 MW, but was scheduled to have up to 70,000 MW by the end of 2005.
It now expects to have 26,300 MW by the end of 2003. Plants with a
combined capacity of 82,000 MW have been canceled or postponed. Plants
under construction with another 200,000 MW of capacity are on the auction
block.

FERC to Create Power Market Oversight Unit

  The FERC plans to create a new market oversight unit to prevent
manipulation of wholesale electricity prices and supplies. The new Office
of Market Oversight and Investigations is designed to protect customers
through vigilant oversight of the nation's energy market, according to the
FERC. It plans to have the office operating with a staff of over 50 by
this Spring. The FERC currently has an office of Markets Tariffs and
Rates, which monitors markets in a broad way. But, the new office will be
FERC's first attempt of defining and curbing market power, either through
refund orders or courts.

JP Morgan Posts 4th Quarter Loss

    JP Morgan Chase posted its first quarterly loss in 5 years after it
wrote off loans to Argentina and Enron. The bank lost $332 million, or
$0.18 per share, compared with earnings of $0.34 per share, or $708
million, in the 4th quarter of 2000. The banks decision to lend to Enron,
Argentina and others that defaulted kept it from profiting from the lowest
interest rates in 40 years. Competitors that took advantage of the low
rates are reporting increased earnings. JP Morgan took a write-off of $456
million for trading losses and loans to Enron and still has exposure of
$2.06 billion of potential losses. The lender had a complex relationship
with Enron as it traded with the company, advised it and loaned it money.
JP Morgan will attempt to recover its Enron loans, some of which were not
backed by collateral, in bankruptcy court. The bank is also suing
insurance companies for $965 million for insured oil and natural gas
contracts. In addition, JP Morgan took a charge of $351 million for loans
to Argentina, which devalued its currency and defaulted on its bonds. It
is one of 4 US lenders with large exposures in the country. The bank said
it lost $385 million in its private equity business, and also allowed $510
million to cover further possible loan defaults in response to
deteriorating market conditions.

Paris Carver and Flathead wells are located in Green Canyon Block 601 and
Walker Ridge Block 30, respectively.  Paris Carver was drilled to a total
depth of 24,120 feet in 4,572 feet of water, and Flathead was drilled to a
total depth of 28,043 feet in 6,556 feet of water.  Marathon has plugged
and abandoned the Paris Carver well.  The Flathead well has been
temporarily abandoned and, after completing additional technical studies,
Marathon is considering reentering and sidetracking options. Marathon was
operator of the Paris Carver well and holds a 50% interest in Blocks 601
and 602; and also operated the Flathead well, and holds a 100% interest in
Block 30.

Dominion Resources Expects 4th Quarter Costs


    Dominion Resources had 4th quarter expenses of $348 million for losses
from dealings with Enron and for a restructuring. The companys 2001
earnings, excluding some items, met or exceeded forecasts of $4.15 per
share. The expenses include $97 million related to Enron, a $183 million
write-off of Dominion Capital assets and $68 million from a restructuring.
The Enron costs involve $6 million for past sales to the energy trader and
$91 million for the decline in value of forward natural gas contracts with
Enron. Dominion expects profit this year of $4.90 - $4.95 per share.
Earnings after 2002 should rise at an average annual rate of 10%, Dominion
says.  Last November, Dominion cut its senior-management team by 19
officers, or 25%. Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its 2002 natural
gas production and 40% of its 2003 natural gas volume at prices above
current market prices.
-------------------------------------------------------------
UBS to Restart EnronOnline

    Natural gas traders who did large volumes of business with Enron are
taking a wait-and-see approach toward dealing with the new market player
expected to emerge from the recent deal with Swiss bank, UBS. Some have
their doubts about UBS' potential impact on the market. The deal calls for
UBS to restart the trading business, including EnronOnline, with the help
of 830 former Enron workers. However, even if the deal does get the
court's approval, there is still some question among marketers and traders
as to whether a revitalized trading operation could recapture the dominant
market share Enron held prior to bankruptcy.

President Urges Senate to Act on National Energy Plan

    In an address in New Orleans, President Bush said that it was a matter
of national security for the US to have a National Energy Package. The
president urged the Senate, where energy legislation is currently stalled,
to take immediate action to pass a National Energy Plan. The president's
remarks come prior to Congress reconvening next week after the holiday
recess. The White House, labor and business leaders support the
development of resources in ANWR to increase energy independence, national
security and create over 755,000 jobs. Opening the ANWR could double the
current domestic supply of oil and make the US far less reliant on foreign
sources for its energy needs. The US Geological Survey reports that the
1.5 million-acre tract holds upwards of 16 billion barrels of recoverable
oil, which is the energy equivalent of 17.7 billion barrels of gasoline,
enough to supply the total US gasoline demand for nearly 6 years. Arctic
Power, an Alaskan-based non-profit organization that supports the opening
of ANWR says that Congress has debated ANWR for over 14 years and now it
is the responsibility of the Senate to face up to the realities of the
present situation. The 2,000 acres of the ANWR designated for exploration
could replace Iraqi imports for the next 70 years.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Natural Gas Futures Dip Lower in Late Sell-Off


   Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX dropped $0.043
yesterday to $2.185 per MMBtu, stymied by local and trade selling on the
close. The March contract lost $0.037 to $2.195 per MMBtu. The market
opened higher and hit $2.30 early on the strength of Wednesday's AGA
storage report of a 190 Bcf withdrawal last week, the largest since 1994.
However, the market worked its way lower for most of the day until a
bearish weather forecasts, including a prediction of the return of El
Nino, contributed to a sharp drop off below $2.20 thirty minutes before
the close as paper and trading houses liquidated. The market is in
contango, with each succeeding contract more expensive. The price for the
February contract has fallen more than $0.55 since assuming the prompt
position on December 28th. Look for more weakness today as the
fundamentals deteriorate. Storage and weather are the keys to this whole
market, and both are bearish. Look for the market to test weekly lows at
$2.14 today. Yesterday, an estimated 83,000 contracts trading, with 41,000
spreads or hedge trades. Few utilities were seen in the physical market
yesterday, and prices held a $0.04 - $0.05 premium to the NYMEX, well
below the $0.12 premium seen Wednesday. As weather moderates, utilities
tend to switch off storage and turn to the physical market for natural gas
needs, creating a price squeeze in some markets as that extra supply
dwindles. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to up slightly. Natural gas for next day delivery at the
Henry Hub gained $0.01 to $2.32 per MMBtu.

Open Season for Desert Crossing Pipeline


    Allegheny Energy Supply, the Salt River Project, and Sempra Energy
Resources which are planning to build a natural gas storage and pipeline
system in the Southwest are taking bids from companies for capacity
through the system. The open season will last until February 8th, and will
gauge industry interest in the proposed Desert Crossing project.  The
response will determine the scope of the system, whose initial costs are
likely to be $600 - $700 million. The Desert Crossing project, pending
regulatory approval, would include a 10 Bcf natural gas storage complex in
Arizona and an 800 MMcf per day pipeline running from near Las Vegas to
southwestern Arizona. The 300-mile pipeline system would connect the
storage complex with all of the major interstate natural gas pipelines in
Arizona and southern Nevada. The pipeline is expected to be ready for
operation by the summer of 2004, while the storage facility would begin
incremental service in 2005 with full service forecast in early 2008. The
storage complex would allow hourly access to natural gas, permitting
customers to tap supplies to meet unexpected surges in demand from power
plants.

Enron Considers Bids for Trading Business at Auction


    Enron is negotiating with at least 6 potential buyers of its wholesale
trading business at an auction. The winning bidder will assume control of
51% of Enron's online trading unit, which generated about 90% of the
company's $100.8 billion in revenue in 2000. A hearing is scheduled for
today to approve the sale. Enron is met with the bidders in six conference
rooms in its New York law offices, going from room to room making comments
to the effect that if you want to have the best offer you at least have to
make the following improvements to your bid. Every bidder had a different
offer and some proposals are more complete than others. Enron's trading
unit buys and sells oil, petroleum products, natural gas, electricity,
metals, coal, forest products and steel, and a variety of contracts and
derivatives. Enron would get cash and a 49% stake in a new partnership
called 'Netco' under the proposed sale. Citigroup has submitted a bid, and
UBS AG, the largest Swiss bank, also made an offer. BP has offered $25
million for Enron computer systems for trading natural gas and
electricity. The banks hope to profit from as much as $7 billion in
previously arranged trades and gain a better shot at collecting money they
are owed by Enron. Bids might total as much as $1 billion in cash and
debt.

Andersen Disposed of Enron Documents


    Enron's accounting firm, Andersen, has admitted its employees disposed
of or deleted a number of documents related to its audit of Enron.
Andersen, which has come under fire from investors and lawmakers for
signing off on Enron's books, said it had notified the SEC, the Justice
Department and congressional committees and other agencies investigating
Enron's collapse. In recent months individuals in the accounting firm
involved with the Enron engagement disposed of a significant but
undetermined number of electronic and paper documents and correspondence
relating to the Enron engagement. The SEC's enforcement chief says that
the destruction of documents was an extremely serious matter. In testimony
before Congress last month, Andersen CEO said it had warned Enron of
possible illegal acts, but said it had failed to provide the auditor with
key information. Some industry experts say the deliberate destruction of
key document can be tantamount to an admission of guilt. The ramifications
could be huge. Most accounting firms keep their audit records for at least
4 years. Anderson says it has suspended its records management policy
immediately and has instructed all its partners and employees to retain
all existing documents until further notice.

Lay Called Cabinet Members to Warn of Possible Bankruptcy


   Enron Chairman Lay called the secretaries of the Treasury and Commerce
departments prior to the company's collapse to warn them the company could
be in financial trouble or go bankrupt. In the call to the Treasury
secretary, Lay referenced Long-Term Capital Management, a hedge fund that
got a $3.5 billion bailout from Wall Street which was engineered by the
Federal Reserve. Lay informed the secretary of Enron's problems and raised
the possibility that they may have an effect on credit markets similar to
that of LTCM. The secretary told Lay that he would pass the information on
to officials at Treasury who found no signs of ripple effects. Lay told
the Commerce secretary that he was worried that the decision to downgrade
Enron's bond rating would lead to bankruptcy, with harmful effects to the
energy industry and the economy as a whole. After Lays calls, the cabinet
members both agreed that no action should be taken to intervene on the
part of bondholders. Neither informed the president of their conversations
until yesterday morning. The president said that he has not spoken to Lay
since last spring. President Bush has announced the creation a task force
to review corporate disclosure rules after Enron's bankruptcy. The task
force includes the secretaries of the Commerce, Treasury and Labor
departments and officials from the SEC, the Federal Reserve and the CFTC.

California AG Files Civil Lawsuit Against PG&E


    California's attorney general has filed a civil suit against PG&E, the
parent company of the states Pacific Gas and Electric utility, alleging
its fraudulent business practices drove the utility into bankruptcy. The
lawsuit asks for damages of $600 million to $4 billion and any other
penalties that might be awarded. The state's attorney general contends
that PG&E drained the assets of its California utility, saying that money
went from the utility to the parent company and then to unregulated PG&E
units. PG&E said that the lawsuit was unwarranted, discriminatory and
potentially harmful to the California economy. The company pointed out
that the PUC and state lawmakers have reviewed its transactions with
affiliates and found no illegalities. The attorney general charges that
PG&E violated 22 conditions set by the PUC to protect customers from the
potential risks and abuses of a holding company structure. According to
the conditions, PG&E was prohibited from using money from the utility to
fund its unregulated businesses and was directed to give first priority to
the utility's need for capital in the event it experienced financial
difficulties. The AG claims that during a 3-4 year period, the utility
gave more than $4.6 billion in cash to PG&E, $1.76 billion in shareholder
dividends and stock buybacks.

Natural Gas Futures Dip After AGA Report


    Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX ended down
$0.03 to $2.076 per MMBtu yesterday. The March contract lost $0.029 to
$2.089 per MMBtu. The market opened lower yesterday and then hovered
around $2.10 until the AGA reported that 124 Bcf was withdrawn from
storage last week. There is now 2.4 Tcf left in storage, 73% of capacity.
A year ago there was less than 1.4 Tcf and storage was only 42% full. The
number was slightly below some expectations of a 130 Bcf-150 Bcf pull, and
it was enough for the market to sense $2.00/MMBtu support. Look for the
market to bounce around above $2.00 some and eventually head lower.
Initially the market may to push back toward $2.14 on the strength of
failing to breach $2.00 level after the AGA report, and a record high of
funds being short, but with no reason to cover short positions with no
weather in the offing. So look for low volatility over the short term.
Working gas is on track to end winter at 1.44 Tcf compared to a 5-year
average of 980 Bcf. Look for cash to take the initiative in leading the
futures market downward, with physical prices trading at a premium to
NYMEX since December. With mild weather forecast and a Tcf in storage
above a year ago, spot prices could start trading at a discount to
futures. Turn-back volumes should weaken pricing. Natural gas for next day
delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.05 - $0.15 lower
yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.07
to $2.11 per MMBtu.

Former Andersen Partner to Claim 5th Amendment

    David Duncan, the former Andersen partner who led the auditor's work
at Enron has advised lawmakers he will not testify at a hearing on today
unless his testimony is protected from use in court against him. He was
subpoenaed by the House Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee to
testify on Enron's rapid collapse amid questionable bookkeeping.
Explaining that he had just gotten access to documents from his own files
at Andersen, Duncan says he will invoke the 5th Amendment right not to
testify. However, he will testify today if the committee grants him
immunity, which is not likely. Duncan claims to want full disclosure of
the truth and remains committed to cooperating with all pending
investigations concerning Enron, but says he needs immunity first. He was
fired earlier this month by Andersen, which alleges he ordered the
destruction of documents once he learned of a request by the SEC for
information on Enron's financial reporting.

Senate Committee Seeks Release of Enron Tax Returns


    The Senate Finance Committee has requested that Enron provide it with
written authorization to release to the public information contained in
its federal consolidated tax returns, and any tax information related to
Enron's affiliated companies or partnerships that is not included in the
consolidated tax returns since its inception in 1985. The committee, which
is probing Enron's compliance with federal tax laws, also plans to review
the use of corporate tax shelters and perhaps examine appropriate
legislative action. Enron allegedly used 880 subsidiaries in tax haven
countries such as the Cayman Islands and Mauritius to avoid paying income
taxes in 4 of the 5 years leading up to 2000, the most recent year for
which records are available. Enron received about $400 million in tax
refunds during that period. Enron has said it paid $60 million under the
corporate alternative minimum tax for 2001. The committee has the legal
authority to review Enron's consolidated tax returns as well as those of
its affiliated companies and partnerships, and said it will exercise that
authority. However, it is not legally authorized to release the
information to the public without Enron's permission.

Hydro-Quebec Exports Leads to Record Profit

    Hydro-Quebec is North America's largest power utility. Its 2001 net
profit reached a record C$1.1 billion, thanks to high electricity exports
to the US and despite warmer than usual weather. The profit forecast for
2001 had been C$1.03 billion and the net income for 2000 was C$1.08
billion. Hydro-Quebec is in excellent financial position, but has
confirmed that it will ask for an increase domestic power rates as of May
2004 to bring its rate of return in line with other North American
utilities. If accepted by the Quebec Energy Board, the rise will be its
1st in 5 years. The overall rate increase will be C$354 million over 3
years. Hydro-Quebec has also forecast average annual demand will increase
by 1.2% through to 2016. Growth in the past 15 years has been around 2.6%.
The utility also plans to launch the 1st of a series of tender invitations
to private power producers this year to make sure there will be no
shortfall. It is expected to report today the level of its water
reservoirs, a source of major concern.

Dynegy 4th Quarter Profit Up 36%


    Dynegy's 4th quarter earnings climbed 36% as profit from operations
rose to $144 million, or $0.41 per share, from $106 million, or $0.32, a
year ago. Revenue slid 13% to $8.74 billion. Dynegy's earnings met the
average estimate of analysts. Profit at the company's energy trading unit
jumped 58% last quarter from a year ago, due to a sharp increase in
business after Enron collapsed. Natural gas sales in North America gained
14%. In the 4th-quarter, Dynegy wrote off $51 million, or $0.14 per share,
for trading exposure to Enron. It also took charges of $7 million, or
$0.02, to terminate its bid for Enron and $9 million, or $0.03, for
severance costs at its Illinois electric utility. The company ended up
with a net income of $77 million, or $0.21 per share. Dynegy had thought
that Enron-related costs might climb to $125 million. It will pay a $65
million dividend over two years to ChevronTexaco for the $1.5 billion
provided for the planned $23 billion acquisition of Enron. Dynegy projects
earnings of $0.41 per share for the 1st quarter and reaffirmed its per
share profit estimates of $2.26 for 2002. Dynegy still plans to boost
earnings by 15% per year from acquisitions. It has recently sold stock and
plans to sell assets and cut expenses, totaling $1.25 billion to reduce
debt to reassure investors and maintain its investment grade credit
rating.

Shell Buys Out German Solar Power Partners

    Royal Dutch/Shell has increased its solar power commitment by taking
full control of a German joint venture that has become a world leader in
the fast growing industry. Shell already held 33% of Siemens and Shell
Solar GmbH, and now has agreed to acquire both the 34% interest of Siemens
and the 33% stake held by power utility EON. The deal gives Shell 100%
control of one of the world's few established producers of solar
photovoltaic cells and panels and a 15% share of the global PV market.
Though still relatively expensive to produce, it is a key potential energy
source that could cut fossil fuel use and emissions. Shell will combine
the business with its global Shell Solar operation, raising the number of
people it employs directly in the industry to 1,100. Shell Solar merged
its German solar business with Siemens and EON last April. Siemens said it
pulled out because the existing loss-making structure was not core to its
business and would not grow on its own, and it did not want a minority
stake in the enlarged group. Shell has not disclosed financial details of
the transaction, but said last year it would spend between $500 million
and $1 billion on renewable energy investments over the next 5 years.

PPL Notifies NRC of Operating License Renewal Plans

     PPL Susquehanna has informed the NRC it plans to seek renewal of its
operating license for the Susquehanna nuclear plant in 2005. Because of
the lengthy  review process, the NRC has requested that plant owners file
early notification of their plans to apply. If the NRC approves PPL's
application, the plant's operating license would be extended by 20 years.
The current operating licenses for Units 1 and 2 will expire in 2022 and
2024 respectively, but NRC approval of the extension would allow PPL to
operate the nuclear plants until 2042 and 2044. A nuclear plants license
can be renewed for a maximum of 20 years after it has proved that it can
operate safely and manage maintenance issues related to aging equipment.
The plant has 2 reactors, each with more than 1,100 MW of generating
capacity. Nuclear power plants were originally granted a 40-year operating
license and currently 50 of 103 operating nuclear reactors have said they
will apply for license renewal. Of the 50 units, 14 are in the review
process and 8 have been approved, with another 28 providing notification
of their intent to submit applications to the NRC. Nuclear power provides
about 20% of PPL's almost 10,000 MW in generation capacity. PPL
Susquehanna, a subsidiary of PPL, operates the plant and owns a 90% share,
Allegheny Electric Co-op holds the other 10%.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Natural Gas Futures Tumble Below $2


     Natural gas futures for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled 6.3%
yesterday, falling $0.129 to $1.908 per MMBtu. The March contract lost
$0.12 to $1.984 per MMBtu. The market opened lower yesterday morning and
soon dropped below $2. It was the lowest price seen since last September's
$1.83 per MMBtu expiration for the October contract. In afternoon trading
prices dipped as low as $1.85 on a bearish weather forecast, but quickly
recovered to finish the session on an up-tick. Physical prices were kept
up by cooler weather in the Mid-continent region. Cold weather in the West
also pushed up cash prices there, but only marginally. The AGA report to
be released tomorrow afternoon is expected to show a withdrawal of about
110 - 120 Bcf. Look for the cash market to follow the NYMEX downward
today, although weather concerns in the nation's midsection reflect a
slight bullishness. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and
Canada was generally flat to down $0.05 yesterday. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.01 to $2.02 per MMBtu.

Enron's Due on Enron Wind Sale

    Bids for Enron Wind were due yesterday, as the profitable company is
expected to soon be sold to European owners. Five companies are in the
running, so it is likely to take Enron several weeks to announce a buyer.
The purchase price is likely to be about $500 million. Enron Wind is
making money and is not included in Enron's bankruptcy filing. Its
revenues jumped from about $50 million when it was acquired by Enron in
1997 to $750 million in 2001. Last year was by far the best year in the
company's history. The bankruptcy court will have to provide some kind of
oversight for the sale of any Enron material assets. Likely bidders are
Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems, German-Danish wind turbine maker Nordex AG,
General Electric and some financial groups from Europe. Enron Wind will
likely end up bought by the Europeans, who have a stronger presence in the
wind energy sector. The top 5 wind turbine manufacturers are three Danish,
one Spanish, and one German. Vestas plans to set up a blade and assembly
plant in the US if the tax credit is extended, and NEG Micon already has
an assembly plant here. More than 1,000 MW of projects have been put on
hold in the US because the tax credit has yet to be renewed. About $5
billion of new wind power was installed worldwide last year, bringing the
total over $20 billion.

PanCanadian and Alberta Energy Merge

    PanCanadian Energy and Alberta Energy have reached an agreement to
merge, forming one of the top independent oil and natural gas company in
the world in terms of proved reserves, production and value. The share
swap deal will create a C$27 billion exploration and production company
with operations in the US, the North Sea and Ecuador and major
Canadian-based operations. The newly merged company will be called EnCana
Corporation. The top executives of each company plan to enhance the market
value and prevent a takeover of either firm. Canadian energy companies
have historically experienced a lower stock market value than US rivals in
terms of multiples of projected cash flow per share, used to measure the
value of companies. Some say that pension funds looking to invest in North
America exploration would not have considered the companies before because
they were too small, but the new company is large enough to attract
institutional investors. It has been estimated that EnCana could
eventually have a multiple of 7.75 to 8.75 times cash flow, suggesting a
target price of C$44.50 to C$52.00. Competitors Anadarko and Burlington
Resources currently trade at 9.7 times and 8.7 times respectively. As part
of the deal, AEC stockholders will receive 1.472 PanCanadian shares for
each of their shares, which values AEC at about C$9 billion. PanCanadian
had been mentioned as a takeover target when it was spun off from Canadian
Pacific last fall. The deal carries a C$350 million break up fee for
either firm should it cause the merger to fall through.

Enron Collapse May Have Ripple Effect


    The ripple effect caused by the collapse of Enron may have harmed
securities across a broad range of asset classes. Revelations about
Enron's murky financial statements have generally cast doubt on corporate
accounting practices. Some say that the stock market now carries a higher
equity risk premium because of Enron's collapse. In some cases, investors
who lose money in one market unwound their exposure in others, leading to
a spiral of forced selling. Even companies with no Enron exposure are
experiencing investor risk aversion equal to those that had direct
financial dealings with the company. For example, Kmart would likely not
have been vulnerable to energy sector risks in the past. But Kmart claimed
that insurers had raised premiums for surety bonds, which Kmart needed to
cover certain contingent liabilities. Enron's collapse also worried
investors about other energy companies, like Calpine, El Paso and Mirant,
forcing them to adjust their balance sheets. The fallout from Enron likely
led to a downturn in outstanding commercial and industrial loans over the
past month. Another sign of potential contagion effects is a $266 million
outflow from high yield bond funds last week was attributed by to fears
aroused by the Enron and Kmart bankruptcies. Each new Enron disclosure
fuels fears that the economy is threatened by the fallout. And, whether
actual contagion exists or not, fear of it seems to led many companies' to
distance themselves from the energy trader.

California PUC Urged to Shift Power Choice Date

    An administrative law judge to the California PUC has urged the
regulators to amend a ruling that jettisoned the right of customers to
choose their electricity provider. The ALJ says the ruling needed to be
changed because it unfairly shifted almost $2 billion of costs to utility
customers. To avoid penalizing the customers, the ALJ recommends that the
PUC set July 1st as the cutoff date for energy users to sign new direct
access contracts to buy electricity from independent companies. The CPUC
voted last September to cancel the customer choice option as of that date.
Without the change in dates, consumers who continued to take power from
their local utility will be responsible for $1.98 billion. That is because
from July 1st to September 20th last year, about 11% of the total electric
service of the state's investor-owned utilities shifted from bundled
service from the utilities to direct access service from other companies.
About 10,000 businesses signed the new power deals last summer when
wholesale electricity priced dropped, a move severely criticized by state
consumer groups. However, the PUC reserved the option to shift the cutoff
date back to July 1st if the Sept 20th date hurt customers who stayed with
their utility.

MARKET OUTLOOK

 Hold on to the short position in the March natural gas futures. The
GasTrader model is still in a bearish mode and continues to stay short,
although no new trades are recommended. Prices continue in a pervasive
downtrend, yet stop loss provisions are in place to guard against any
unexpected price rallies.  The massive short interest held by non
commercial accounts is of concern, but the stop loss provisions of the
model are designed to cope with what economists call ""exogenous
variables"". Weather, storage, and the economy are all negative, and
combined with the unfavorable technical environment suggest that prices
could work  still lower. GasTrader Consultant is a natural gas futures
trading program designed to minimize the opportunity costs (losses) that
often result under the best intentioned but often misguided hedging
programs. Specific trading parameters are in place daily and trades are
executed on the close or at predetermined trading points.  Results assume
positions are maintained in the spot (most liquid) futures contract and
are rolled over on the 16th of the month prior to contract expiration.  If
the program is in a long mode producers and physical market longs would
lift all hedges.  Conversely if the program is in a short mode end users
would lift their hedges. If the model is flat or neutral, a conservative
strategy requires hedging by both long and short market participants.  It
is believed that by combining natural gas price trends with hedging
requirements opportunity costs can be minimized and greater participation
in market moves can be realized. Hedging costs are synchronized with the
market.

Natural Gas Futures Driven Lower by Lack of Fundamentals


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.13 to $2.106
per MMBtu yesterday on mild weather and a continuing huge storage
inventory. The March contract lost $0.118 to $2.118 per MMBtu. Contracts
were in contango with each succeeding month more expensive than the prior
month. There's a lack of support across the board. Cash prices will likely
weaken more by the weekend ahead of next Tuesday's February contract
expiration with forecasts again predicting above normal temperatures for
the next two weeks across most of the nation. A general lack of
fundamentals and technical weakness should pressure the market below $2
soon. This week's AGA storage report is expected to show a 130 - 140 Bcf
withdrawal. Anything less and the market could looking at $1.70 per MMBtu
by expiration. As storage operators face requirements to release volumes
out of storage, that extra gas hitting the market could force prices down
quickly. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally $0.20 - $0.40 lower yesterday. Natural gas for next day delivery
at the Henry hub lost $0.23 to $2.18 per MMBtu.

 Unocal Finds New Alaska Natural Gas Reservoir


    Unocal has discovered a new natural gas reservoir on Alaska's Kenai
peninsula which is expected to yield significant natural gas reserves. The
test well had a 39-foot pay interval yielded restricted flow rates of up
to 11.2 MMcf per day. The Grassim Oskolkoff 1 well, located 35 miles south
of Kenai, Alaska, is operated under a joint operating agreement between
Unocal and Marathon Oil. Unocal owns 40% working interest in the well and
the surrounding 25,000 acre exploration area, and Marathon owns the
remainder Unocal has also begun a separate 3-well exploration program on
the southern Kenai Peninsula. Unocal and Marathon have formed Kenai
Kachemak Pipeline to build a natural gas pipeline that will connect the
new producing area with the existing south central Alaska pipeline system.

Enron's Assets Being Sold Off


    Now that Enron's energy trading business, which produced about 90% of
the its $100 billion of sales in 2000, has been sold to UBS for no cash
and a share of future profits, the rest of the company's assets are being
sold off to pay creditors a small portion of over $40 billion that they
are owed. Although company officials have said they are committed to
keeping the core intact, it is slowly being dismembered and there may be
little left to reorganize. Enron claimed assets of more than $50 billion
in its bankruptcy filing, but they may actually bring much less when sold.
The commodity trades and derivative contracts that Enron entered into
before filing for bankruptcy were estimated to be worth up to $8 billion
last month, but now it says the about 700 open position are worth about
$1.3 billion. It is seeking court permission to settle the contracts to
raise cash. Since it collapsed, Enron has sold about $520 million of
contracts and assets and lost control of its $2.7 billion Northern Natural
Gas Pipeline, but is contesting Dynegy's rights to the pipeline. As part
of its plans to emerge from bankruptcy, Enron wants to place litigation
against it in a trust and raise between $4 - $6 billion by selling assets
in Latin America and Asia. Centrica Plc has agreed to buy Enron's UK
energy supply business for $137.1 million and Kinder Morgan plans to buy
Enron's share in a natural gas pipeline for $68 million. AEP has purchased
wind generators in Texas from Enron for $175 million. Enron could also ask
the bankruptcy judge to allow the $2.98 billion sale of its Portland
General Electric utility to Northwest Natural Gas. It also hopes to sell
other businesses, including the Wessex water utility in Britain. Currently
Enron's most valuable asset is Transwestern Pipeline, which is worth about
$1.2 billion, and might get creditors $640 million after paying off about
$560 million in debt.

Virginia Wants FERC to Rethink RTOs

    The Virginia State Corporation Commission claims none of the existing
regional transmission organizations currently proposed for the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will provide significant benefits for the
state, and has told the FERC to reassess the RTO landscape. Meanwhile, on
Northeastern RTO formation, most states are urging the FERC to maintain
the status quo and focus on incorporating market standards rather than
require a single RTO to cover the entire region. The Virginia SCC says its
location, bordering the Mid-Atlantic, Southeast and Midwest, puts them in
a delicate situation in relation to the RTO question.

Enron's Dabhol Project Nears Auction Block


    Lenders to Enron's $2.9 billion Dabhol Power in India are set to put
it on the auction block, with 6 major companies likely to express
interest. The plant has been idle since last June after a dispute over the
cost of the power for its sole customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board. Due diligence is expected to begin early next month, with a
possible deadline of the middle of March for submitting offers. Interested
foreign companies are Shell, TotalFinaElf and Gaz de France. Potential
Indian buyers are BSES Ltd, Tata Power and Gas Authority of India.
Publicity which focused on Enron's problems in India has given the
country's image a black eye as a safe place to invest. Some in India claim
that Enron coerced and hoodwinked a freshly elected state government into
signing off on a power project it had previously tried to stop. The World
Bank, which refused to fund the project, said it was too large, too costly
and the terms were slanted in Enron's favor. Maharashtra's demand for
energy did not rise as expected and meanwhile, the devaluation of the
Indian rupee and climbing prices for naphtha raised the price of power
production. Enron owns 65% of the Dabhol project, GE and Bechtel each own
10% and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 15%. Those interested in
acquiring the plant must put up a non-refundable $100,000 in earnest
money. The sellers intend to sell the plant as a whole, but bidders may
bid jointly for the operation and split it up later. A London data room
will be established for the commercial and financial agreements, operating
and historical data, projections and information on the status of Phase
II. Construction on the 1,444 MW second phase was stopped when the state
electricity board fell $240 million behind in payments. The 740 MW first
phase was launched in 1999.

Debt Rating Agencies Considering Reforms


    Following complaints by investors, analysts and lawmakers that
Moody's, S&P and Fitch were too slow to downgrade Enron, the credit
agencies have all said they are considering reforms that would speed up
their review process for altering a company's ratings. The changes could
lead ratings to become more volatile and affect stock and bond prices. It
could also raise the cost of  borrowing for companies that need cash.
Fitch and Moody's have said they may eliminate outlooks, meant to be a
guideline of a rating's possible future direction. There will now be more
rating changes that are multiple notches and corporate ratings will become
more volatile and lower than they have been over the last decade. The
agencies have already changed their criteria for the assessment of a
company's ratings. All are taking a closer look at rating triggers and a
company's ability to raise needed cash. This month, the agencies
downgraded Kmart, which has now filed for bankruptcy, several notches in a
matter of days. Moody's rated Kmart's debt as investment-grade a little
more than a month ago. Moody's put Calpine on review for only one day
before lowering its debt rating. It also kept Ford on review for only 5
days before downgrading its debt. The effects of the Enron collapse could
hurt other companies facing a cash crunch by subjecting them to more
stringent scrutiny. S&P said it is focusing more on movement in a
company's stock and bond prices.

PanCanadian to Spend C$1.7 Billion This Year


    PanCanadian Energy plans to spend C$1.7 billion in 2002 to increase
both its natural gas production and proven oil reserves by 10%. About 70%
of the expenditures will be directed at natural gas projects with C$430
million spent on prospects in Canada's East Coast offshore region, the
deepwater Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. PanCanadian plans to drill
1,800 wells this year, down from about 2,150 in 2001. Last had major
offshore and international exploration successes, with preliminary results
showing that it replaced about 170% of production. Oil production is
expected to decline by 5% year over year, although phase one work on the
Christina Lake oil sands project will be completed early this year, and
has the potential to add significant reserves and production in the medium
term. PanCanadian also is evaluating production options with its partners
at its Buzzard oil project in the North Sea. PanCanadian's share of the
discovery is more than 180 million barrels of recoverable crude oil.

PNM Plans to Retire Transmission Line Debt

  Public Service Company of New Mexico has asked the New Mexico Public
Regulation Commission for authority to enter into a transaction that would
cause the retirement of $27 million of Secured Facility Bonds due 2012.
The proposed transaction will reduce PNM's long-term debt and give the
company majority ownership of the 216-mile long Eastern Interconnection
Project line, which connects PNM and the Western US with the West Texas
electrical grid. PNM entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in 1985
that allowed the company to levelize the EIP's cost to PNM and its
customers over the lease period. The proposal would result in the
redemption on April 1, 2002 of the Secured Facility Bonds at a price of
$1054.30 per $1000 principal plus accrued interest to April 1, 2002.

Natural Gas Prices Up Slightly Ahead of Weekend

    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX ended slightly higher
Friday, ending up $0.019 to $2.204 per MMBtu on slow range-bound trades in
a boring market after hitting a high of $2.26. The March contract rose
$0.008 to $2.203 per MMBtu. The market open up and worked its way higher
after a cold-weather forecast was released midmorning. However afternoon
trading saw a steady erosion of prices and there was no pop-up in the
market before the close as is usual on Friday. The cold front should give
a little support to the market this week, but storage operators will be
calling on customers to withdraw volumes by the end of January to meet
contract requirements, which could bring prices down on high supply. Look
for support is at $2.14, a critical level that, if breached, could see the
market drop to $2 per MMBtu. Expect resistance at $2.27. However, unless
sustained cold weather shows up soon, prices are likely headed well below
$2 per MMBtu. Weather since October 1st, based on heating-degree days, has
been 25% warmer than last heating season and 14.6% warmer than normal. Big
speculators, including commodity funds, are seen as supporting the market,
based on the latest CFTC report. Funds increased their net short positions
to 47,104 on January 8th, up 42% from their 33,103-contract net short
prior position. Large commercial players held a net long position of
39,596, up from 27,367. They ended the latest reported period with 363,856
longs and 324,260 shorts. Open interest rose to 434,291 from 400,200.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally
flat to $0.05 higher or lower Friday. Natural gas for next day delivery at
the Henry hub lost $0.02 to $2.30 per MMBtu.

 Judge Keeps Enron Cases in New York


    A judge has ruled that Enron's bankruptcy case will stay in New York.
The decision is a setback for Dynegy and other Enron creditors who had
wanted the case moved to Houston. In addition, Enron's $10 billion lawsuit
against Dynegy for pulling out of a planned merger will be tried in New
York. According to the judge, keeping the case in New York would best
serve the debtors' reorganization efforts since New York is a world
financial center and has the resources that will be required to address
the debtors' financial issues. Enron's Chapter 11 case and the lawsuit
were filed in Manhattan, where a small unit, Enron Metals and Commodity is
based. Dynegy said that both cases should be heard in Houston in the
interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties. Dynegy said it
was disappointed with the decision, but expects that all of Enron's
creditors will be treated fairly regardless of the venue. The attempt to
transfer the case to Houston divided Enron's creditors. Several banks
based in New York opposed a transfer. A committee appointed to represent
Enron's unsecured creditors also wanted to keep the case in New York. Some
Houston-based creditors such as El Paso, Reliant and a group of Enron
401(k) plan holders, were in favor of Houston.

Drillers Idle Rigs Until Oil and Natural Gas Prices Rebound

    Pride International, which had 25 drilling rigs drilling for oil and
natural gas in the Gulf of Mexico a year ago, has idled 15 of those rigs.
Energy exploration companies have cut back their budgets on contract
natural gas drilling as prices plunged 80% from a year ago and oil fell by
30%. It is estimated that companies will cut spending on drilling by about
20% in North America to $42.5 billion. For every non-active rig, about 50
workers join the unemployment line. Apache has said it plans to cut
capital spending 70% after spending $1 billion last year. Burlington
Resources said it will spend 19% less than last years $1.3 billion.
Kerr-McGee has estimated spending would be half that of 2001. BP plans to
defer a $600 million Alaskan drilling program and 20% of its workforce in
the state lose their jobs. However, not all oil and natural gas explorers
are cutting spending this year. Phillips plans to raise its exploration
and production budget by about 2% and Unocal expects spending to maintain
current levels. ExxonMobil estimates a 10% increase in spending from as
much as $7.3 billion last year. Pride has reduced its active rig fleet and
now has lowered contract rates by 55%. Some analysts believe that drillers
should not cut their operations too steeply, due to the inevitable rise in
natural gas prices. Pride says maintenance crews run engines and keep
everything in order on the idle rigs for when prices rebound. Elsewhere in
the world, where the exploration costs are usually lower, the outlook for
oil drilling is not as dismal. Exploration spending by the industry on
overseas wells has been estimated climb by as much as 11%.

San Francisco Concerned over Power Project Delays

    The California ISO is worried that recent cancellations and delays in
the construction of more power plants in and around San Francisco could
have detrimental effects on the city's power supply. Those worries have
increased after Mirant delayed a project to increase generation capacity
at the aging 363 MW Potrero plant. The company said the project is on the
deferred list, but that is basically due to permitting. Mirant said it
intends to proceed with the permitting and then other decisions will have
to be made, but made no commitment beyond that. Potrero is not the only
generating plant that is causing concern for officials in San Francisco.
The Hunters Point station, owned by Pacific Gas & Electric, was built in
the 1920s and new power turbines were last installed in the late 1940s and
1950s. In addition, Mirant has 2 other power plants in Contra Costa County
across the bay from San Francisco, which were also scheduled to be
upgraded. The company said it will complete expansion work at one plant,
but improvements at the 2nd station are held up by problems with Bay Area
pollution rules. The ISO said that the alternative to avoid power
shortages is to expand the transmission grid delivering electricity into
San Francisco from the peninsula to the south. Many energy companies have
cut back their expansion plans in the wake of the collapse of Enron and a
sharp drop in wholesale power prices. Mirant has said it would complete
about 5,700 MW of power under way, but will defer or cancel 8,300 MW.

UBS Wins Apparent Control of Enron's Trading Operations


    Swiss bank UBS Warburg is the apparent winner of an auction for
control of Enron's energy trading unit. If the bankruptcy judge accepts
UBS bid, it would mean a venture into a new area of business for UBS, the
investment banking arm of the Swiss bank trades in commodities,
derivatives, and other instruments but not oil and natural gas. The value
of the winning bid or other details were not disclosed. As part of the
deal, Enron would retain a residual interest in the income of the business
but UBS would assume none of Enron's past, present or future liabilities
or trading positions. The company says that with UBS' 'AA' credit rating
and Enron's proven industry expertise, the shift in control will maximize
the value of the trading operations. The operations, which have been idle
since early December, generated most of the energy traders $101 billion in
profits for 2000. After all night negotiations in New York, the bid was
approved by Enron's 15-member unsecured creditors committee, a court
appointed group representing some of those that Enron owes. Members of the
committee said that they would have been comfortable with either UBS or
Citibank, the other bidder for the trading operations, but that the UBS
bid was a little more lucrative. However, Citigroup could still come back
with a sweetened offer and present it to the judge next week. Citigroup
declined to comment because it has never publicly admitted to being a
bidder.

Ontario Power Price Volatility Likely to Increase

    Ontario can expect large swings in electricity prices after its power
industry is opened to competition in May, according to some experts.
Ontario plans to introduce competition into an industry that has 29,500
MWof generating capacity and serves almost 12 million people. The
deregulation process was originally scheduled for November 2000. Price and
supply problems accompanied deregulation in Alberta and California over
the past two years, including and some expect the same for Ontario.
Alberta spent billions of dollars on rebates to cushion the impact on
consumers of its difficult transition. But Alberta's power charges, after
rising sharply in the run-up to its market opening in 2001, have declined
to about C$71 per MWh from C$133 per MWh in 2000. The economic slowdown,
additional generating capacity and lower natural gas prices have pushed
down prices across North America. But, the spot market remains volatile,
with Alberta's wholesale prices ranging from C$6 per MWh at off-peak times
to C$879 per MWh at the highest peak last year. So Ontario power prices
under the new market are likely to be more volatile than they were before
for the foreseeable future. But, while there will be more price swings,
Ontario's power prices will be lower over the longer term because of
increased competition. And a large reserve of generating capacity should
shelter Ontario residents from sky-high peaking prices boyh California and
Alberta suffered through. But Ontario will pay a price for its slow
movement toward competition. The weak economy and reduced capital
available to potential buyers are reducing bids for publicly owned power
plants by up to 50%. Ontario Power Generation must sell 4,200 MW of
capacity within 4 years to encourage competition, and within ten years
reduce its share of the market to under 35%.
