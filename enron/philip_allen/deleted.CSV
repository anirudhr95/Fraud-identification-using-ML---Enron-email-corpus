"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

WHY THE RIAA OWES US ALL AN APOLOGY

    When recording industry types last week tried
         to get provisions against music swappers
         included in anti-terrorism legislation,
         they trivialized everyone involved in America's
         fight against terrorism--and proved themselves
         to be absolutely the sort of people who'd do
         anything for a buck.

"FW: Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Wright, Lee  
Sent:	Thursday, October 18, 2001 4:37 PM
To:	Bodyshop
Subject:	Security Smart ID Tags-Off Property Usage


To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

     Phillip,

     I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing
     both
     the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
     documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First
     Amendment.
     Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
     possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make
     sure
     that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also
     enclosed
     is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the
     version I
     e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as
     the
     date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000
     Extension Fee.

     Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address
     described
     below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me at
     (512)
     370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck at (512) 703-5000.  Thanks.

     Subject:  Summary of Today's Meeting

     Phillip,

     Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
     summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

     1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions
     you
     gave us and move forward with this approach.

     2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for
     Topics
     reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
     sign-off on each topic.

     3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
     incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We
     will
     meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
     designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
     Monday with the room number.)

     Have a good weekend.
     Mery

    SUN, MICROSOFT AND THE ROAD TO THE 'FRICTION-FREE ECONOMY'

    The Internet and World Wide Web gave
    birth to an idea--a hyperefficient
    economy that operates less like a heat-producing
    mechanical engine and more like a motor
    coiled with a superconductor. To understand
    this basic idea is to understand Sun,
    Microsoft and their dueling ambitions
    for Web services.

  WHY INTEL COULDN'T MAKE ITS CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FLY

   Long the king of PC microprocessors, Intel
         thought it could rule the world of consumer
         electronics, too. Not so. Josh and John find
         Intel's decision to abandon consumer products
         disappointing, but not surprising.

"Summary of Today's Meeting","Phillip,

Thank you for meeting with us today. I want to take a few minutes to
summarize the decisions that came out of our meeting.

1. Feedback Approach: We will incorporate the ideas and suggestions you
gave us and move forward with this approach.

2. SME Review of Knowledge System Topics: When the time comes for Topics
reviews, we will send you the name of the SME who is responsible for
sign-off on each topic.

3. Conversion and Arbitrage Problems: We will brainstorm ways to
incorporate more problems without going over our 4-6 hour target. We will
meet with you next Tuesday at 10:00 to review the problems as we've
designed them so far and arrive at a solution. (I will send an e-mail
Monday with the room number.)

Have a good weekend.
Mery

"TECH ALERT: Amazon Loss Narrows, Compaq Swings to Loss","__________________________________
TECHNOLOGY ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


Oct. 23, 2001

Amazon.com reported a narrower third-quarter loss that matched analyst
expectations, amid weak growth in revenue. The online retailer stuck with
its profitability target.

http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB1003846717456773240.htm

Compaq swung to a wider-than-expected loss in the third quarter on a 33%
drop in revenue amid shipment problems and slack demand for computers.

http://interactive.wsj.com/articles/SB1003850514482125080.htm

_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

GRAB A SEAT, AND JOIN ME FOR MY DINNER WITH BILL GATES

    On the eve of Windows XP's launch, I joined
         14 other journalists for a private dinner
         with the chairman and chief software architect
         of Microsoft.  We had one thing in common: When
         Bill talks, we write about it. And on this night
         he was talking, and just to us. Here's part
         one of what Bill had to say.

    WILL THE PATRIOT ANTI-TERRORIST BILL BETRAY US?

    A new anti-terrorism law, which significantly
    expands law enforcement powers, is
    speeding into law. So now we'll see:
    Whether Congress, with our assent,
    acted wisely or whether we allowed fear
    to lead us astray.

   The birth of Microsoft's newest operating

  SERIOUS ABOUT SECURITY? BETTER DOUBLE YOUR OPTIONS

   Think user IDs and passwords are adequate?
         Think again. Those single-factor security
         systems are quite vulnerable. Add a second
         element, such as an ID card, and the solution's
         more secure. David looks at the promise--and
         the difficulties--of two-factor security.

I spoke to Wendy this morning who mentioned that you would be signing both
the Special Warranty Deed and the First Amendment and FedExing both
documents to me.  Enclosed please find the Deed and the First Amendment.
Please compare the enclosed Deed with the version of the Deed in your
possession.  I don't think anything has changed, but I want to make sure
that the version of the Deed you sign is the latest version.  Also enclosed
is the First Amendment.  The only change to this document from the version I
e-mailed to you a few days ago is the insertion of ""June 29, 2001"" as the
date the Title Company acknowledged receipt of AMHP's $25,000 Extension Fee.

Please sign both documents and FedEx them to me at the address described

Wouldn't you know it: the house is already occupied... by  ghosts (13 of them!) with a decidedly deadly agenda. Also new this  weekend: when a seemingly normal man (Kevin Spacey) announces he's from another  planet, it's up to his psychiatrist (Jeff Bridges) to find out exactly what's  behind his strange story in the drama K-PAX .  N'Sync boys Lance Bass and Joey Fatone swap music for movies in  On  the Line , and Snoop Dogg is a ghost  determined to clean up his old neighborhood in  Bones .    Coming Soon: Monsters, Inc.

"FW: Chase Backtest","Attached is the file I'm proposing to send to Chase with suggested wording.  To eliminate ""Chase""  from using data to ""back-in"" to pnl, we deleted all up days, and forwarded out corrected data, per files received from Jeff and Stacey.

Please review and provide feedback.  Additionally, if you are comfortable with data, please authorize its release.

Thanks
Frank


 


""Steve

Following on from our discussion concerning the back testing data, we have re-checked the underlying data with our middle office. There were some errors in your file which we have now corrected, and for clarity, included losses in the backtest file, since these are what we consider in the backtest process. 

I trust this helps - let us know if you need anything further

"RE: Updates to our Video Production Timeframes and Scope","
Kirk - My update was regarding storyline video with actors/actresses. Enron
Legal is now reviewing the scripts we will need for this video shoot.

This timeframe communicated below is NOT applicable for the Enron experts
who will be filming expert stories. The video shoots for the Enron Expert
Stories will be held December 10th and 11th and Ann Chen will be working on
this (I have forwarded her your response below). However, I agree with your
comment to Phillip. We need to identify these additional Enron experts to
be filmed as soon as possible.

Sorry for the confusion and again, thanks for your help.

Team
FYI

Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in
the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for
additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls
& meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails.
This will keep me in the loop. Thanks

Phillip
If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon
as possible. Thanks

Cheers

Kirk -

Thank you for helping us work towards sign-off from Enron Legal. Seeing as
you haven't been closely involved, I thought you'd like an update on our
media production tasks.

As you know, we are completing our planning phase for the production of the
storyline scripts. Our media vendor, Cramer, has been extremely helpful and
enjoyable to work with.  Below is an email from Steve, the director for our
storyline video, explaining where we are in the production process.

Have a good day!

Hey Sheri,
I hope you had a great Thanksgiving! I can't believe it's over
already! Anyway...we've shuffled the schedule around, securing the 6th and
7th of
December for the shoot in the studio. We're working on finalizing the
edit dates to reflect that shift. Chris is moving to hold all talent for
those dates.

I guess it's now in the hands of legal! As soon as we confirm the edit
suite
availability
we'll revise and post the new schedule. We're scheduled for our weekly call
tomorrow but if
anything comes up just give me a buzz!
Thanks Sheri!
Steve

Subject: Updates to our Video Production Timeframes and Scope


Hello Steve and Chris -

Recently, there were changes to the overall number of our scenarios in our
simulation. There will be seven scenarios versus the nine we have been
discussing. These changes result in:
        Deletion of 2 intro and 2 exit videos
        Deletion of six interview questions (see more detail below)
        No additional characters. We will still need all characters (and
        talent) that we have casted for.

Laura has been working with John to make the required edits to the scripts.
We have recieved today (mid-day).

Based on our last discussion, I'd like to recommend we set the date for our
shoot for the end of the first week in Dec. Specifically, Dec. 6th and 7th.
This recommendation is based on the response I received from our project
manager in regards to the time it will take to have Legal review our
scripts.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you and have a
wonderful Thanksgiving!

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance","Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Fantasy Football Matchups   ? Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our  Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)  Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports  on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed  each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd  like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops  over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings,  click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the  report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom  settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

"2002 Toyota Camry XLE: Best-Selling Style and Refinement","
			Sponsored Content	
[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE]  	 2002 Toyota Camry XLE:  Best-Selling Style and Refinement      The Toyota Camry casts a long shadow on the U.S. car market. It was  introduced back in 1983 as a boxy hatchback and sedan that quickly became  known for its eminent practicality and bulletproof reliability. Subsequent  generations became larger and more powerful, with the Camry line expanding  to include a wagon and a coupe. Toyota designed it to appeal to as many  buyers as possible, and buyers responded by making the Camry one of  America's best-selling vehicles.   For 2002, the Camry has been completely redesigned on a brand-new platform.  The new generation is being sold solely as a four-door sedan, although last  year's Camry Solara continues as a coupe and convertible. Toyota claims  that the new Camry's design is both sportier and more personal than the  sedans that came before. We evaluated a Camry XLE to find out if Toyota hit  its mark.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance","Gentlemen

Good day. I hope all is going well. 

If I do not hear from you by COB tomorrow I will take your silence as acceptance and that their are no non-conformities to prevent acceptance of this deliverable. In addition, this includes the condition of what we can change for the two week period following acceptance (see below). This action is necessary as contractually we are coming to the end of the acceptance period for this deliverable. 

Good news is that this deliverable and the Topic Framework deliverable are the last two deliverables for the Design Phase of the project. Thanks

Cheers

Subject:	Revised High Level Design-Sign-off for Acceptance

Phillip/Tim/Yevgeny
Please review the two attachments below for final sign-off and Acceptance of this deliverable.

Phillip, you have approved these documents prior to Tim and my input reflected below, which primary consist of showing how the Knowledge system is connected to the simulation system (Tim's idea with some direct guidance from me to Accenture on how to reflect this in the flow chart). Thus it shows how the user can go to the knowledge system and get help during the simulation. This is reflected in the high level design flow chart.ppt

In addition, Accenture has added the following condition language to the High Level design. doc

	After sign-off on this document, the following things can be changed within the first two weeks of the content development phase:
?	Small story-line details (Example: company background, learner role)
?	Resources (reports and interviews) (Example: add a news article, remove a storage report)
?	Order and details of learner actions and decision (Example: add a sub-step where learner identifies the location of each risk; have the learner calculate net present value after choosing the best instrument rather than before)

Changes to any other High Level Design elements (Example: add a step where learner uses a pricing model to price a deal), or changes to anything after the first two weeks, will impact the budget and schedule. 


Issue: Do we agree to this condition. I recommend we agree. Although, we are in the content development phase the two week period begins from the time we accept this deliverable. I have confirmed this with Accenture and they will send another email with this change, but I do not want to hold up acceptance since we are on our clock. 

Thanks. Phillip, Tim & Yevgeny (if possible), please e-mail with your thumbs up or further input at your earliest convenience, but no later then COB 10/23.

Cheers
Kirk

Kirk -

In regards to your response to move these reviews up and hopes to get the
ball rolling before Monday, November 26th - I will be sending you three
messages following this with the drafts of five topics that are ready for
SME review.
1) Options and Futures for Dutch Quigley
2) Forwards and Swaps for Andy Lewis
3) Organizational Structure for Berney Aucoin

I hope sending them in this manner will make it easier for you send to
Phillip and ultimately, the SMEs.

Our goal is to send you the following topics by EOD tomorrow:
1) Risk Identification and Commodity Fundamentals for Ed McMichael
2) Risk Management Inputs and Hedging Basics for Mark Reese

Reminder that Accounting & Reporting will be written by Errol McLaughlin
(from Jeff Gossett's group) and will not be complete until mid-December.

As far as storyline scripts are concerned, I am unable to send anything to
you prior to the EOD tomorrow. Unfortunately, our script writer can not get
them to us any sooner. Hopefully you can forward them to Legal for them to
see first thing Monday morning. I apologize for not being able to get them
to you sooner.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Good afternoon Kirk -

As a reminder, the following are upcoming reviews we will need from Enron.

**Scripts for Storyline Video:  These scripts will be ready for Enron Legal
to review first thing Monday morning after the holidays - Nov. 26th. Based
on our production shoot schedule and reserving the actors/actresses, we
would like these reviews completed by EOD Wednesday, but can have them no
later than EOD Thursday.  As I've mentioned before, these scripts should
not take more than two hours to review. Please let me know if there are any
issues with this timeframe as it will significantly impact our schedule as
well as the production house and hired actors/actresses' schedules. Thank
you.

Topic Content for the Knowledge System: We will have all but one of the
topics ready for SME review/edits first thing Monday morning - Nov. 26th.
As we discussed, I am hoping you can send these to Phillip for him to
forward on to the SMEs. We will be sending these topics to the following
SMEs for their review and edits.
     Risk Identification - Ed McMichael
     Commodity Fundamentals - Ed McMichael (waiting on one homework
assignment from him)
     Futures - Dutch Quigley
     Options - Dutch Quigley
     Swaps - Andy Lewis
     Forwards - Andy Lewis
     Risk Management Inputs - Mark Reese
     Hedging Basics - Mark Reese
     Organization Structure - Berney Aucoin (we are still missing content
for Mid-Marketer/Origination)

The last topic, Accounting and Reporting, will be developed later in the
process as Errol McLaughlin will be helping us write this througout the
first two weeks in December. Berney Aucoin will need to review this.

Diluted earnings per share were $.22, down 59 percent from a year ago. Net revenues on a managed basis totaled $5.5 billion, down one percent from $5.6 billion a year ago. The company's return on equity was 14.2 percent.   Results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items: a previously announced restructuring charge of $352 million pre-tax ($232 million after-tax) and the impacts from the September 11th terrorist attacks.   The September 11th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses, including: provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments, insurance claims, and waived finance charges and late fees. The combination of these items totaled approximately $98 million pre-tax ($65 million after-tax).   The company also incurred costs of approximately $42 million since September 11th, which are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact the quarterly results. These include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the company's offices in lower Manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. Costs associated with the damage to the company's offices, extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. The company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its Ists and losses will be covered by insurance.   The third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately 6,100 jobs and asset impairment and other costs, all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units, the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions, the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations, the outsourcing of certain activities, and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the Internet. These initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately $325 million in 2002. A portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business.   In addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge, the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and, as of September 30, had realized savings in excess of $700 million.   Net income for the third quarter, adjusted for the restructuring and one-time costs related to September 11th, was approximately $595 million, down 19 percent. On a similar basis, earnings per share were $.45, down 17 percent. The company's adjusted return on equity was 16.7 percent.   ""While we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings, the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending, business travel and investment activity slowed after September 11th,"" said Kenneth I. Chenault, chairman and chief executive officer, American Express Company. ""In light of the weak economy and financial markets, we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. The progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. This, along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise, positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy.""   Travel Related Services (TRS) reported quarterly net income of $248 million, down 51 percent from $507 million in the third quarter a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $195 million pre-tax ($127 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Also included in the results are $87 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of one-time costs and waived fees directly related to the September 11th terrorist attacks. Excluding these costs and the restructuring charge, TRS' net income would have been $432 million, down 15 percent from the third quarter last year.   TRS' net revenues rose two percent, as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a 28 percent fall in travel sales. These declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since September 11th. Prior to September, billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. Net finance charge revenues were higher, due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. This increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter.   The provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in U.S. lending write-off rates and delinquencies. Marketing and promotion expenses were lower as TRS scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. Operating expenses rose, reflecting increased Cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. These expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost-control efforts.   The above discussion presents TRS results ""on a managed basis"" as if there had been no securitization transactions, which conforms to industry practice. The attached financials present TRS results on both a managed and reported basis. Net income is the same in both formats.   On a reported basis, TRS' results included securitization gains of $29 million pre-tax ($19 million after-tax) and $26 million pre-tax ($17 million after-tax) in the third quarters of 2001 and 2000, respectively. These gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses.   American Express Financial Advisors (AEFA) reported quarterly net income of $145 million, down 46 percent from $269 million in the third quarter a year ago. Net revenues decreased 14 percent. Included in third quarter results are $62 million pre-tax ($41 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier and $11 million pre-tax ($8 million after-tax) of insurance claims directly related to September 11th. Excluding these items, AEFA's net income would have been $194 million, down 28 percent from last year.   AEFA results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. The weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. As a result, management and distribution fees fell 15 percent.   Operating expenses, excluding the above-mentioned charges, decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-control initiatives.   As of September 30th, approximately 4 percent of the company's $33 billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securities, down from 12 percent a year ago and 8 percent last quarter. The reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits.   American Express Bank (AEB) reported a quarterly net loss of $43 million, compared with $7 million of net income a year ago. Included in third quarter results are $84 million pre-tax ($57 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier. Excluding these charges, AEB's net income would have been $15 million, approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year.   While AEB sustained damage to its premises due to the September 11th terrorist attacks, the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. Consequently, these costs did not impact AEB's quarterly results.   AEB's business results reflect strong performance in Personal Financial Services and Private Banking. Results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of AEB's reengineering efforts. These were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher Personal Financial Services loan balances, and lower revenue from Corporate Banking as the company continues to shift its focus to Personal Financial Services and Private Banking.   Corporate and Other reported net expenses of $52 million, compared with $46 million a year ago. Included in third quarter 2001 results are $11 million pre-tax ($7 million after-tax) of the restructuring charge noted earlier.

--------- Inline attachment follows ---------

From:  </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PALLEN>
To: 'med@dyalroberts.com' <troberts@dyalroberts.com,>
Date: Monday, November 26, 2001 7:10:01 GMT
Subject: 

Mike & Tony,

Rather than fill in the design selections, I have attached a spreadsheet that estimates the costs.  Since I have spent so much time researching the house, I think my numbers are pretty close.  

I would be interested in working with a contractor on a cost plus fixed fee basis.  I don't know if this would be agreeable to you.  Take a look at the numbers and let me know what you think.  If we could work together on this basis, I will complete the design selections.  I will make the adjustments necessary to stay within the allowances as we get actual quotes from sub-contractors.

We are torn between two good locations.  However, we are leaning towards Kerrville.  The lot in Kerrville is substantially more expensive than our lot in San Marcos, so we are really stretched to make this house work financially.  We have decided that if we can make Kerrville work within our budget we will go ahead, if not we will fall back to  our plan to move to San Marcos.  

I don't know how many jobs you have going currently, but if we could reach an agreement we would like to start immediately.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"How do I eat crow and still make it tasty???????","To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:

You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls
(or e-mails). We really do but have been holed up trying to complete
this project ASAP. We knew that this might upset some clients, but we
found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our
users back on-line.

We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked
your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #). This
process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100
IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and
confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected. After verifying
data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track. Some of
you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than
once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want
displayed on your IBS screen. Should this be the case, please e-mail (or
phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right
away.

To our IBS Billpayer clients:

During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill
payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring
payments scheduled to process on particular days). This has become our
highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the
process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this
information. We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the
months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence
(and support).

Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and
ourselves) do not have to go through this process again. Should you be
one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account
information, please refer to the following information:

1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was
the correct password) and been given the error message ""You have failed
to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or
contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset."" This is
the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you
online (on the phone or by e-mail [our preferred method]). Should you
receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for
either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @
830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182. If you reach our voice mail
(or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back
#.

2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the
ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder). Please try again using the
last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the
primary account holder. Since we have released these accounts for IBS
access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn#
(this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will
be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:

Name
Address
City, State Zip+4
Phone #
E-Mail Address

After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be
instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can
at this point change your password back to what it was before).  Always
remember that your password is case sensitive.

Again we want to thank you for your patience through this (trying)
ordeal, and we look forward to serving your IBS needs in the future.

Sincerely,

Howard Gordon
Network Manager

         their visions for Web services. But is calling
         the competition a battle a fair assessment,

    NANOTECHNOLOGY: INSIDE THE 'SINGLE MOLECULE' TRANSISTOR

    Death and taxes aren't life's only inevitabilities

    Latest example comes from Bell Labs,

  WHY VIEWSONIC'S NEW MONITOR FALLS FLAT--PLUS MORE
  REVIEWS

   New 17-inch flat-panel displays have become
         almost affordable in the past year. But at
         $799, ViewSonic's new model is at the high
         end of the price range--and the features don't
         justify the cost. Josh and John tell you why
         as they bring you this week's new-product
         roundup.

  PRIVACY: WHY TECH SHOULD TAKE A BACK SEAT TO TRUST

   Microsoft and the Liberty Alliance may end
         up producing incompatible single sign-in
         technologies. But David says the bigger issue
         is whether consumers and businesses will
         put their faith in one, both--or neither.

   Adobe Acrobat is a great tool for converting

         any software, anywhere. But Preston knows
         not everyone wants to pony up for the full program,

"RE: howdy!!","
Philip,

What is going on down the street?  Curious to hear any perspectives you may
wish to offer from the trading floor?  Enron stock is now lower than when I
joined the company out of business school.  I imagine there are quite a few
not so happy people these days.  We can relate somewhat over here at NPW
with a stock at around $1.25 (in fact we broke $1 a few days ago).  Knowing
you, I do not imagine you are letting any of these events get you down
much.  I have taken a similar approach to our problems here at NPW.

Hope everything else is going well for you and the family.  Have you had
the knee surgery yet?  Give me a call when you have a chance.

Later,

Al Pollard

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

10 COMDEX PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO SEE (AND CAN)

    I couldn't possibly do justice to all the things
         I saw at Comdex in the 600 words that make up
         my column. But since pictures are worth a thousand
         words--and video even more--I'm still able
         to give you a good glimpse of 10 products that
         are well worth watching.

UNLUCKY 13: MY TOP TECH TURKEYS OF ALL TIME

    It is sad that a fowl so noble--not to mention
         savory--has come to symbolize lame thinking
         and laughable losers. But alas, it has. And
         so in honor of our national holiday I've assembled
         a list of things that, well, I can't be thankful
         for. Once I've given you mine, why don't you
         give me yours?

    GET READY TO SHOP... MS'S NEUKOM DEPARTS... FBI LISTENING IN...

    It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas...well,
    at least in the shopping malls, and probably
    at your favorite online stores, too.
    This holiday season, the biggest retail
    names are putting extra effort into
    making their online shops as good as
    their offline ones--and, unlike past
    years, in making your experience there
    as pleasurable as possible.

  GET A STEAL ON A CELL PHONE THAT'LL KEEP YOU IN CONTACT(S)

   If you fumble with your PDA every time you make

         contacts. A lot of high-end phones do this,
         but they're pricey. Janice finds an affordable

"Wednesday Meeting","Phillip,

I will get a room for our Wednesday 10:00 meeting and e-mail you with the
room number. FYI, our goal is to discuss the expert path (best answers) for
the storage problem and to ask you some specific questions regarding
storage.

Also, if you have time, could you send me a definition of Intra-Month Risk?

Thank you for your help.

"Thank You","Phillip,

I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are
getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a
message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems
because we are planning to also include some of your ""easy"" problems in the
simulation.

We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four
scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes
up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them.

We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your
help, and have a great weekend.

"Summary of Today's Meeting","Phillip,

Here are the key points that came out of today's meeting:

1. We will move Conversion and Arbitrage from the Simulation layer into the
Knowledge System layer. We will incorporate 5-10 problems of each type.

2. You will provide us with the name(s) of people who can give us content
for these problems. We will set up two rounds of meetings; one early next
week to gather content and a second meeting for review.

3. We will change ""Gas Daily Risk"" to ""Intra-Month Risk"" throughout the
simulation. Can you provide us with a definition of Intra-Month risk?

4. Just to clarify: For conversion, we were planning to cover problems
where there is no perfect hedge so the learner has to find creative ways to
hedge, as opposed to conversion of mmBTU to decatherms, conversion of oil
volumes to natural gas volumes, etc. Is that what you had in mind too?

Thank you in advance for your help. Have a great Thanksgiving.
Mery

	     NT   5.92 -0.03    Nortel Networks Reports Results for Third Quarter 2001   TORONTO, Oct 18, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.):         --  Revenues from continuing operations: US$3.7 billion     --  Pro forma net loss(a) per share: US$0.68; before incremental         charges: US$0.27     --  Net loss from continuing operations: US$3.5 billion     --  Positive operating cashflow contributes to increase in cash to         US$3.4 billion    Nortel Networks Corporation(b) (NYSE:NT)(TSE:NT.) today reported results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2001 prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles.   Revenues from continuing operations were US$3.69 billion for the third quarter of 2001 compared to US$6.73 billion in the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001, excluding incremental provisions and other charges, was US$854 million or US$0.27 per common share. Including the incremental provisions and other charges, pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the third quarter of 2001 was US$2.18 billion, or US$0.68 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$597 million, or US$0.19 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000.   In the quarter, incremental charges included in the pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) were comprised of: US$750 million (pre-tax) for excess and obsolete inventory, primarily related to Optical Inter-City; US$767 million (pre-tax) for increased provisions related to trade receivables and customer financing; and US$380 million (pre-tax) primarily related to charges associated with certain third party investments. The Company also recorded: a US$801 million (pre-tax) charge for restructuring associated with the completion of the workforce reductions and facilities closures announced in June 2001; and a US$223 million (pre-tax) charge primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of its Photonics Components business.   Including Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, and one-time gains and charges, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2001 of US$3.47 billion or US$1.08 per common share.   ""Revenues for the quarter reflected the challenges presented as the telecom industry adjusted to new levels of spending,"" said John Roth, president and chief executive officer Nortel Networks. ""Our bottom line results reflected the impact of actions we have taken to adjust to the new business levels. During the third quarter of 2001, Nortel Networks continued to aggressively implement its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. The Company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even at a quarterly revenue level well below US$4 billion. The structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter of 2002.""   Frank Dunn, the Company's new president and chief executive officer effective November 1, 2001, said, ""Nortel Networks is focusing its investments and its organization to drive continued leadership across three businesses: Metro Networks, which encompasses metro optical networking, IP networking, IP services and voice over IP solutions for service providers and enterprises; Wireless Networks; and Optical Long Haul Networks. In the quarter, our product programs continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading portfolio of solutions. We also continued to work with our customers to help them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reductions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for new revenue streams. Some key milestones over the past 120 days included:         --  the First North American ILEC began the circuit to packet         transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade         softswitch;     --  Announced Metro DWDM wins in the United States, Europe and         Japan;     --  Announced Multiservice backbone awards (ATM, IP, MPLS) in         China, Germany and Asia;     --  Continued progress on 3G Wireless Internet infrastructure         deployments and completed the first commercial UMTS test calls         and the first CDMA2000 1X mobile IP call;     --  Introduced advances in IP solutions, including an integrated         Layer 4-7 content switching capability on our Layer 2-3 Edge         Switch Router; and     --  Completed hardware design, significantly advanced software         integration and began production of OPTera Connect HDX         solution.""    As announced on October 2, 2001, the Company expects to have an overall workforce of approximately 45,000 after the completion of its work plan. Notifications to employees impacted by workforce reductions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of October 2001. A workforce reduction and related charge will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001. Over the next few quarters, the Company also expects to continue to divest non-core businesses in accordance with its work plan. The number of positions which will be impacted by this divesture activity (including the impact of divestures announced or completed to date) is expected to ultimately approach 10,000 positions.   Commenting on cash management in the quarter, Frank Dunn said, ""We are extremely pleased with the results that have been generated from our focus on cash management, which drove a significant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operations. In addition, the Company further increased its financial flexibility by completing a highly successful US$1.8 billion convertible debt issue which, combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operations and a significant reduction in short term debt, has significantly enhanced our strong liquidity position. Given the industry correction and actions we have taken over the last two quarters, Nortel Networks balance sheet is well positioned.""   ""While we believe we are beginning to see early indications that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainable levels, it still remains difficult to predict. In light of this and the uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wake of the September 11, 2001 tragedies and their effect on economies and businesses around the world, we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of 2001 or the full year 2002 at this time,"" concluded Dunn.         Revenue Breakdown from Continuing Operations    Network Infrastructure revenues decreased 48 percent in the third quarter of 2001 compared to the third quarter of 2000. Wireless Internet solutions grew substantially in Canada and slightly in Asia, which was more than offset by a considerable decline in Latin America, a slight decline in the United States and a decline in Europe. Optical Inter-city revenues were down sharply in the United States, Europe and Latin America, minimally offset by growth in Asia. Local Internet revenues were down substantially in the United States, Europe, Canada and Latin America, which were minimally offset by an increase in Asia.   Photonic Components segment revenues were down 93 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. The sharp decline in the segment was largely due to considerably lower sales of Nortel Networks Optical Inter-city solutions compared to the third quarter of 2000.   Other revenues declined 29 percent in the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Substantial growth in Global Professional Services in Europe and Asia, and strong growth in the United States, was more than offset by considerable declines in legacy voice solutions for corporations across all regions and wireless OEM revenues in most regions.   Commensurate with its announcement on October 2, 2001 to align its resources around three businesses (Metro Networks, Wireless Networks and Optical Long Haul Networks), Nortel Networks will evolve its financial reporting to reflect the new organization beginning in the fourth quarter of 2001.   Geographic revenues for the third quarter of 2001 compared to the same period in 2000 decreased 54 percent in the United States, 53 percent in Canada and 30 percent outside the United States and Canada.         Nine-Month Results    For the first nine months of 2001, revenues from continuing operations were US$14.06 billion compared to US$19.75 billion for the same period in 2000. Pro forma net loss from continuing operations(a) for the first nine months of 2001 was US$4.01 billion, or US$1.26 per common share, compared to pro forma net earnings of US$1.57 billion, or US$0.51 per common share on a diluted basis, for the same period in 2000. Including the net loss from discontinued access solutions operations, Acquisition Related Costs(a), stock option compensation from acquisitions and divestitures, one-time gains and charges, and the write down of intangible assets, Nortel Networks recorded a net loss of US$25.48 billion, or US$8.01 per common share, for the first nine months of 2001.         Spending Management    The Company continued to make rapid progress to reduce its cost structure. Compared to the Company's year-end 2000 cost structure, exclusive of incremental provisions and charges, the Company's cost structure at the end of the third quarter of 2001 is lower by approximately US$1 billion.         Gross Margin    Gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 1 percent reflecting incremental charges of approximately US$750 million related to excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the expected decrease in sales due to the continued downturn in the market. Excluding the impact of these incremental and other contract-related charges, gross margin for the third quarter of 2001 was approximately 25 percent, compared to approximately 26 percent in the second quarter of 2001.         Expenses    Selling, general and administrative (""SG&A"") expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were US$1.92 billion. The continued impact of the market adjustments and further decline in some of our of customers' financial condition resulted in incremental provisions of US$767 million in the quarter related to customer receivables and financings. Excluding the incremental provisions in both periods, SG?expenses in the third quarter of 2001, compared to second quarter of 2001, were down by approximately US$190 million.   Research and development (""R&D"") expenses were US$808 million in the third quarter of 2001. The R?expenses in the quarter reflected focused investments to drive continued market leadership in our core businesses and the elimination of spending in all other areas. Compared to the second quarter of 2001, R? expenses in the third quarter of 2001 were down by approximately US$100 million, reflecting the impact of restructuring and streamlining operations.   The financial results of Nortel Networks Limited(b) (""NNL""), Nortel Networks Corporation's principal operating subsidiary, are fully consolidated into Nortel Networks results. NNL has preferred shares which are publicly traded in Canada. For the third quarter of 2001, NNL took a restructuring charge of US$793 million (pre-tax) associated with the completion of workforce reductions and the closure of certain facilities related to business streamlining; and recorded US$207 million (pre-tax) primarily related to the approximately 50 percent reduction in manufacturing capacity of the Photonics Components business. All such amounts are included in the consolidated Nortel Networks amounts described above.

Nortel Networks disclaims any intention or obligation to         update or revise these preliminary results prior to the filing         of its reported results for the three months ended September         30, 2001.     (2) Reported results for the nine months ended September 30, 2001         and 2000 are net of applicable income tax recoveries of $723         and $46, respectively.     (3) Impact of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting         Standards (""SFAS"") No. 133, ""Accounting for Derivative         Instruments and Hedging Activities"", and the corresponding         amendments under SFAS No. 138, ""Accounting for Certain         Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities"" (""SFAS         133""). The adoption of SFAS 133 did not affect either basic or         diluted earnings (loss) per common share after giving effect         to the accounting change.     (4) As a result of the reported net losses for the nine months         ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, and the pro forma net loss         for the nine months ended September 30, 2001, approximately         71, 162, and 71, respectively, of potentially dilutive         securities (in millions) have not been included in the         calculation of diluted loss per common share for the periods         presented because to do so would have been anti-dilutive.

The loss from         discontinued operations was $3,733 pre-tax ($3,010 afelatedx).         Acquisition Related Costs of $4,433 pre-tax ($4,164 after-tax)         were primarily associated with the acquisitions of Bay         Networks, Inc., Alteon WebSystems, Inc., Xros, Inc., Qtera         Corporation, Clarify Inc., and the 980 nanometer pump-laser         chip business. Stock option compensation from acquisitions and         divestitures was $91. Cumulative effect of accounting change         was a $24 pre-tax ($15 after-tax) gain. One-time gains were         $45 pre-tax ($21 after-tax) and one-time charges were $15,054         pre-tax ($14,241 after-tax), primarily related to the write         down of intangible assets of $12,486 pre-tax ($12,400         after-tax) and restructuring costs of $2,463 pre-tax ($1,748         after-tax).

"RE: Distribution Form","Phillip,

The Social Security and Medicare tax has been previously withheld on your deferral.  You would be subject to only Federal Income Tax withholding on the distribution.  I checked with my director (Pam Butler) on your question about recouping taxes already paid.  It is my understanding that you cannot recoup these taxes.

Thanks,

Renee

Renee,

Thank you for the forms.  I am trying to estimate my tax obligation.  It is my understanding that the account balance will be treated as ordinary income.  What about Social Security and Medicare taxes?  I thought those were already deducted.  Also, the are no earnings on the deferrals I have made.  On the contrary, there are losses.  Is it possible to recoup any taxes paid?

Thanks for you help.

     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

WILL HACKERS MAKE A FOOL OF LARRY ELLISON?

    Larry says his company's new e-mail server--intended
         to replace Microsoft Exchange--is ""unbreakable.""
         But is anything bulletproof if the bad guys
         really want to bring it down? I don't think
         so. But never mind me. If the bad guys don't
         think so, Larry's bravado could be setting
         up his company and his customers for hardship
         and humiliation.

    HO, HO, HO! WHY CHRISTMAS 2002 WILL BE JOLLY, BY GOLLY

    While this is a muted Christmas for most
    of us, it's been a merry one indeed for
    e-tailers. Pat thinks that if this holiday
    generated so much holiday cheer, just
    wait 'til next year. That's when some
    enabling technologies will make online
    shopping far more than the glorified
    catalog-buying experience it is now.

  WHY YOU'RE STILL NOT GIVING CUSTOMERS WHAT THEY WANT

   The Internet promised to make ""mass customization""
         a reality. But so far it hasn't worked out that
         well. Reason: It's simply too costly. But
         is there some way your business can create
         tailor-made goods for even broad markets?
         Adrian thinks so--but it's going to be tricky.

  BUILDING AN E-GOVERNMENT: IT'LL BE HARD, BUT IT'LL HELP IT

   Will the government ever go paperless? It
         looks like in 2002 it might start. Such an undertaking
         would boost government spending and give
         tech businesses a much-needed shot in the
         arm. But it won't be easy. Larry explains why
         it'll be so challenging to bring the government

Please review and provide feedback.  Additionally, if you are comfortable with data, please authorize its release.

Following on from our discussion concerning the back testing data, we have re-checked the underlying data with our middle office. There were some errors in your file which we have now corrected, and for clarity, included losses in the backtest file, since these are what we consider in the backtest process. 

I trust this helps - let us know if you need anything further

"Market Insight: We See Upswing Continuing","
 [IMAGE]  Market  Insight for November 26, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Global Online Financial Services Firm   Introducing  Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research  As a TD Waterhouse customer,  you now have online access to Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm  Research. Just login at tdwaterhouse.com ,  click on 'News & Research', and then on 'Goldman Sachs'.   We  See Upswing Continuing   By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   Selective  accumulation remains in order.  The  early stages of recoveries from bear markets vary widely in degree.  As time passes, however, deviations from the norm become far less  dramatic.   Through  last Wednesday, when we went to press early because of the holiday,  31% of the bear market loss from March 27, 2000 to September 21,  2001 had been recaptured. That's about average for rebounds in  the postwar period. As shown in the table at the bottom right  of this week's edition of The Outlook, at the two-month point  in the recoveries from the nine former bear markets since World  War II, the S&P 500 had won back an average of 33% of the  bear market loss.   In  each of the nine instances, the gain at the end of six months  was greater than that after two months and the gain at the end  of 12 months was greater than that after six months. On average,  nearly two-thirds of the bear market loss was recovered after  six months and almost all of the bear market loss was recouped  in a year.  Economic  and corporate news will remain bad for a while, but that's typically  the case in the early part of a bull market that is associated  with an economic recession. Stock prices start recovering well  before the headlines improve. The September upturn in stocks would  be consistent with the start of an economic expansion in the first  quarter of next year.   While  P/E ratios currently are high, that won't necessarily keep the  bull market from progressing. The preceding economic expansion  was the longest in history and gave rise to ""new era""  optimism. Corporations, especially in information technology,  built production and sales capacity to levels far greater than  proved justified. Those excesses are now being corrected, painfully.  Corporate earnings are in a severe contraction. Once the economy  begins to grow again, however, profits will rebound and P/Es will  start looking much more reasonable. Low inflation, low interest  rates, rapid technological innovation and above-average productivity  growth should help support elevated stock valuations.

"Socal Window Meeting","Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"RE:","Wow!  this looks complicated.  let me get some help on this and get back to you



 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Allen, Phillip K.  
Sent:	Friday, November 16, 2001 8:38 AM
To:	Whalley, Greg; Lavorato, John
Subject:	FW: 


Greg,

After making an election in October to receive a full distribution of my deferral account under Section 6.3 of the plan, a disagreement has arisen regarding the Phantom Stock Account.  

Section 6.3 states that a participant may elect to receive a single sum distribution of all of the participant's deferral accounts subject to a 10% penalty.  This provision is stated to be notwithstanding any other provision of the plan.  It also states that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the committee receives the written request of the participant.  In my case this would be as of September 30th.  I read this paragraph to indicate a cash payout of 90% of the value of all deferrals as on September 30, 2001.  The plan administrators, however, interpret this paragraph differently.  Their reading yields a cash payout of 90% of the value for deferrals other than the Phantom Stock Account, which they believe should be paid with 90% of  Enron Corp. shares in the account as of September 30, 2001.  Their justification is that in several places throughout the plan document and brochures it is stated that the distributions of the Phantom Stock Account shall be made in shares of Enron Corp. common stock.

There are two reason that I do not agree with their interpretation.  First,  section 6.3 begins with ""notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan.""  This indicates that any other payout methodologies described in other sections of the plan which deal with normal distribution at termination do not apply.  Second, the language in section 6.3 stating ""a single sum distribution of all of the Participant's deferral accounts"" indicates that one payment will be made not a cash payment separate from a share distribution.

The interpretation of the administrators goes beyond section 6.3.  If that is the case then section 7.1 should apply.  This section does provide for the Phantom Stock Account to be paid in shares.  However, it states ""The value of the shares, and resulting payment amount, will be based on the closing price of Enron Corp. common stock on the January 1 before the date of payment, and such payment shall be made in shares of Enron Corp common stock"".  This would result in approximately 8.3 shares to be distributed for every share in the account on January 1, 2001.  Although this would be the most beneficial to the participants due to the decline of the value of Enron Corp. common stock from $83 to $10 per share,  this methodology goes beyond section 6.3.

The calculations below illustrate the difference in the value and method of distribution under each of the three interpretations:




Section 6.3		Plan Administrators		Section 7.1

Number of shares		6,600	shares		6,600	shares			6,600 shares
Relative share price		$27.23							$83.13
Phantom Stock Value		$179,718						$548,658
10% Penalty			-17,972			 -600				-54,866
Value to be distributed		$161,746		6,000 shares			$493,792
Current stock price									$10
Distribution			$161,746		6,000 shares			49,379 shares

I believe my interpretation under section 6.3 is correct and fair.  If the administrators insist on distributing shares instead of cash then section 7.1 should apply.  The current interpretation of the plan administrators is a hybrid between the two sections resulting in the lowest possible payout.   

In addition to myself, Tom Martin, Scott Neal, and Don Black are facing the same issue.  I would appreciate your review and consideration of this matter.

Sincerely,


Phillip Allen

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

Which one should I do, the 8x12 is half the price.

October 17, 2001

Jeff:

I talked to your dad and he has mentioned that you might be interested in 
having our class build a shed for you.  We pretty much make whatever you 
would like to the specifications that you prefer. All of our buildings are 
durable and solidly constructed.  We build them in our shop and the ownner 
is rersponsible for their delivery.  There is no labor cost so you are only 
charged for the materials.

Our most popular size and style is the 8' x 12' barn . This is the most 
economical building that we construct and it is an easier one to haul to a 
given site. This building has an exterior of T-111 siding which is cedar 
style grooved exterior plywood which can be stained and sealed. We have 
usually build them with a 3'-10 1/2"" wide door opening.  I would think that 
would be wide enough for a four wheeler, but you would have to have your 
dad measure your vehicle to make sure.. We have probably built and sold 
over 30 of these in the past ten years. The price on this shed usually 
varies between $800 and $900.



Your dad also indicated an interest in a 10 x 12 gable style shed which is 
a bit bigger and ofcourse more expensive.  It has vinyl siding and aluminum 
soffit/overhang, I am attaching a picture of one we made for Joe 
Pronschinske.  This project is a bit harder to transport as it is oversize 
and legally you are  to obtain an oversize laod permit to haul it.   Your 
dad indicated that Joe would possibly haul it though.
The picture I am attaching shows a common 3' entry door.  We are presently 
building a structure for Nolan Goplin that has a overhead 6' wide roll up 
door.  The price on a 10' x 12' shed with a 6' wide roll-up door would be 
roughly $1500.


We will build either style and can modify the plans to meet your 
needs.  With the time we have left in the semester the 8 x 12 would be the 
easiest for us to build, but if you let me know right away, by Monday 
October 22, that you would like a 10 x12 size we would still be able to 
finish that one on time.

If you have any questions just e-mail me or call:
	Whitehall School Disctrict 715-538-4364
	My Home number 715-985-3063.

Have a good one and take with you later.

Sincerely,

Mel Nelson

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

"ENRONONLINE- GAS PHYSICAL GTC CHANGE","Due to the sale of HPL we will be modifying  the General Terms and Conditions (""GTC"") governing all North American physical natural gas transactions on EnronOnline, on Nov 5th. This will require all Counterparties' not having a Master Agreement governing Physicals to accept the revised GTC in order to continue transacting in these Physicals.
In order to ensure minimal disruption to trading we are taking the following steps.
There will be a pop-up announcement to this effect on EnronOnline on Monday Oct 29th 
There will be a ticker with the same information all week , next week on EnronOnline.
The modified version of the GTC will be available on EnronOnline all week, next week for any customers wishing to have their legal departments review it before they accept it.
The EnronOnline marketing group will be contacting customers who had previously accepted the GTC to make sure they are comfortable with the changes.

Phillip,
 
NPW laid off 20% of its workforce about 2 weeks  ago, and I was unfortunately one of them.  I can not believe what is going  on at Enron.  Hope you are doing all right.  Give me a call or drop me  an email when you have a chance at 936-321-6307 or let me know when is a good  time to call you.

In addition we need information on Financial option.


Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.

As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

David,

For clarity, wherever you cite Section 6.2 in your response I assume you mean Section 6.3.  

Your response does not address the key points upon which I based my interpretation of the plan.  The beginning of Section 6.3 states ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan?"".   This implies that Section 6.3 contains the complete rules for an accelerated distribution.  I disagree with your translation of ""a single sum distribution"" as meaning all at once instead of a single amount.  I would like to meet to discuss or appeal to Greg W. or John L.   In addition, your response does not address Section 7.1.  This appears to be the relevant section if the PSA is to be paid in shares.  Additionally the Q & A section in the plan brochure (pg. 8) works through an example of adjusting the number of shares to retain a certain dollar value.  This is the methodology described in Section 7.1.

Tom Martin and Scott Neal share the above concerns.  Please advise of a convenient time we can all meet to discuss further.

Phillip

Subject:	Answer 

For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"ANCHORDESK: iPod for Windows: Why Jobs must join the dark side","<!--[core.text]-->


_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

IPOD FOR WINDOWS: WHY JOBS MUST JOIN THE DARK SIDE

    It's the coolest thing many people say they've
         seen in a while: Apple's sleek new iPod music
         player. But here's the hitch: There's no Windows
         version right now. Will there be? I'm betting
         on it. And here's my plan for Steve Jobs' foray
         into darkness.

    MS TO SETTLE?... LINUX PDA SHIPS... OPEN SOURCE FACES REALITY...

    Microsoft may settle! Again! This time,
    it could get out of a slew of private antitrust
    suits by donating software to schools.
    A good cause, no doubt. But does that
    really make up for its legal violations?

  HOW HACK ATTACKS ARE GETTING SMARTER--AND HARDER
  TO STOP

   Malicious users are learning to better outsmart
         their captors, a new report says. They're
         using hard-to-detect worms to carry out denial-of-service
         attacks, and targeting routers that could
         bring down whole portions of the Internet.
         What should you watch out for? Robert has the
         scoop.

Phillip,
 
I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you closed?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems above or around the garage area to consider.
 
If you find something and it's faxable, please send  it to my fax at 281-858-1127.  Feel free to call first if you have any  comments.

_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

PRESSPLAY, MUSICNET: LEGAL, BUT NOT FOR MP3 PLAYERS

    This is so idiotic that I can't believe I'm
         writing a column about it, but here goes: You
         know those ""legal"" Napster sites the music
         industry is creating? Well, throw away your
         MP3 player, because it won't work with them.
         Are these people nuts?

  WHY THE NEW POWERBOOK G4 IS A MAJOR FASHION VICTIM

   While Stephan's not a huge fan of the Titanium
         PowerBook G4, he thought he should give the
         newest model a try. What did he find? It sure
         looks nice, but it still isn't the greatest
         pro laptop out there.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

    in hardware sales--and now we're seeing
    the rebates to prove it. The company
    is giving cash back--or free toys--to
    anyone who buys its computers from now
    through December, borrowing a tactic
    from its PC-selling brethren. But is
    it too little, too late?

  WHERE'S THE BEEF? AUDIENCES TIRED OF CEOS' EMPTY
  RHETORIC

   At a recent tech conference, Microsoft's
         Steve Ballmer and Sun's Scott McNealy played
         up the jokes, while HP's Carly Fiorina stuck
         to business. Can you guess who won the crowd's
         favor? David finds out that technology execs
         crave substance, not style.

  HOW CITRIX IS SHAKING OFF WORRIES OF A MICROSOFT
  INVASION

   Despite talk that Microsoft will encroach
         on its turf, software maker Citrix continues
         to deliver strong results. What's its secret?
         Larry explains why Citrix is one of the few
         companies that has been able to dance successfully
         with this 800-pound gorilla.

  NO THANKS, BILL. TRY 3 NON-MICROSOFT WAYS TO MANAGE
  PASSWORDS

   Sure, it's a pain trying to remember your username
         and password for the numerous Web sites you
         visit each day, but Microsoft's new Passport
         service is not the only solution. Preston
         digs up three programs that store and manage
         passwords--with no involvement from Redmond.

Kirk -

Attached is our draft of the Organizational Structure topic for the
Knowledge System. Berney Aucoin is the official sign-off for this topic. He
is also responsible for the Accounting and Reporting topic which will not
be ready for sign-off until mid-December. Monica is currently working with
Errol McLaughlin to help develop this topic.

I know challenging times are ahead, please let me know what I can do to
help facilitate this review process. Ideally, we would like to have this
topic edited (includes providing any missing content) by Monday, December
10th.

Thank you.

"FUNDIES MEETING EVERY DAY BEGINNING NEXT WEEK","For those of you that will be in the office after New Year's, we will begin an informal fundies meeting each day to cover what has happened in the market since we filed for bankruptcy.  We will go over pipeline flows, storage balances, weather, monthly and daily prices, etc. With a few of the Banks showing interest in showing a bid, I thought it would be good for us to begin our preparation to trade the market.

Chris Gaskill will be providing the daily packet and Patti Sullivan will provide the daily operations report.   

I was thinking that we should start around 9:30 each morning.

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

"Re: word file as promised","Thanks.  That is an interesting idea.  I'd like to keep the rear stairway
but that might still be possible.  Anyway, let's see what happens with the
variance.  I appreciate your efforts.

By the way, did you have any problems with any of the neighbors?

Bob,

I turned in the application for a variance yesterday.  The hearing will be
on January 8th.  In order to get on the calendar for the Dec 4th hearing,
the application had to be in by November 9th.  I was under the impression
that yesterday was the deadline.  Sorry if I dropped the ball.

On another note, I spoke to Joe Edwards yesterday and he had some useful
suggestions about the addition.   It might be possible to move the addition
forward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the new
space.  You could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and use
the new space for your game/play/music room.  Then you could close off the
existing play room to replace the bedroom lost.  Part of the play room that
is bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could be
used for a built in desk with a couple of computers.  This way you would
not have to add a second staircase.  The walls needed to convert the
playroom to a bedroom should be minor construction.  In the back you could
slope the roof until you were within the setback.  Then you could place a
large dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.
>From the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as your
drawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area below
the addition.  The kitchen and dining room windows would still open to the
driveway but they would be more shaded.  That is the west side of the house
so that might not be a bad thing.  Your ideas about opening up the kitchen
to the living room or dining room would still be possible.  Personally, I
think opening the dining room would be the better idea.

I don't know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested in
exploring anything except your original plan.  But I wanted to suggest
something in case the variance was not granted.  Let me know if you want me
to try and sketch out these ideas.

Phillip

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

MY 2001 FAVORITES: PRODUCTS I COULDN'T DO WITHOUT

    One of the perks of my job is getting to play
         with lots of neat new gizmos. During the past
         year, I tried out dozens of different devices.
         But when it comes right down to it, there's
         only a handful that really made a difference

    Say hello to the new cable king: AT&T

    out AOL Time   Warner and Cox in the contest
    for AT&T Broadband's hand in marriage.
    The cable giant is out   to dominate not
    only the cable-modem and TV worlds,

   WHY IT'S A GREAT TIME TO BE A MAC AND MUSIC LOVER

   First, Apple gave us the iPod, perhaps the
         best MP3 player ever. Now comes a new version
         of its iTunes digital jukebox software, which
         really takes the cake. Josh and John tell you
         why these Apple products--and a slew of other
         gizmos to pass through ZDNet Labs this week--scored
         so well with our editors.

   HOW TO MASTER WINDOWS (AT LEAST WHERE YOU CAN)

   You can't fix all of Windows' idiosyncrasies,
         but you can at least control how it behaves
         when it starts up and shuts down. Preston recommends
         three downloads that let you choose which
         programs load when you boot up, as well as set
         tasks--such as ejecting a CD--for each time
         you power down.

    XP: PHOOEY ON YOUIE! WHY IPOD IS THE APPLE OF OUR EYES TODAY

    Apple poured some precipitation on
    Microsoft's XP-week parade by introducing
    its new MP3 player. But the iPod isn't
    just some mischief at Microsoft's expense.
    Instead, it's a product that embodies
    Apple at its very best and makes you wonder:
    Is Apple underestimating itself by
    not making more things for the rest of
    us?

"Answer","For purposes of an accelerated distribution from the PSA,  a ""single sum distribution,"" in Section 6.2 means that a PSA account is distributed all at once, as distinguished from another form of payout as may have been selected by a participant in his or her deferral agreement.  

Section 6.2 is clear in that the account balance shall be determined as of the last day of the month preceding the date on which the Committee receives the written request of the Participant.  A PSA account balance is reflected in shares of stock since the form of distribution is shares of stock.

Additionally, any portion of a PSA balance attributable to deferral of restricted stock is administered under Sections 3.5 and 3.6 and Exhibit A of the Plan. This section is applicable now as we are accelerating the distribution of PSA balances created with deferrals of restricted stock.  The Plan indicates that upon death, disability, retirement or termination, the share units are converted to shares which are issued to the executive according to the payment election made by the executive at the time of the deferral election.  

      Therefore the distribution you will receive in shares is correct and we do not agree with your interpretation of the plan.

Phillip,


It will go along this lines: (Conservative)

*****************************************************
We pay ""0"" going forward
We have already played 300K in 3Q2001
Outstanding bill for $27,740 will hit Enron Q1, 2002

Enron and surviving entity will have the right to use it internally

We value Enrons SME time @ around 300K

Accenture will have the right to use it internally and modify the product at its will for internal & external use.

This arrangement will void 900K Enrons Revenue from Accenture

Enron would receive 0% royalty on all external sales.  I was thinking to stay away from royalty as we do not know what will be new company position on this matter. Also,  I do not think Accenture will want to enter into partnership structure with a ghost company unless we get Dinergy involved.

***********************************************************************

If we do not reach the agreement: 1. Terminate and pay around 500-600k (estimate)  The payment could be deferred in to 2Q 2002 or
				 2. Continue ""as is"" with payment differed for 90 days or merger.

We are sending Accenture official notice as of tomorrow we have 10 business days to workout solution or terminate.	

Any comments or suggestions?

Yevgeny

Subject:	BRM Case & Options
Importance:	High

Phillip,

I am following up to our BRM conversation from Friday.  Obviously it is a valid questions to ask and as you requested I am attaching two documents: one summarizing the options and  2nd cash flow impact.  In the cash flow impact Case 2 & 3 already account for additional cut of 100k from existing cost.  (it comes from Expenses such as projected traveling 30K+Cut in Media 20K + Cut in sim exercises 50K)  The cut in sim exercises need to be confirmed with you. A total of two sims could be cut one.  Accenture will address this question tomorrow during the meeting.  Also,  I will ask them to cut the meeting by 10 min, thus we can go over the documents and can answer your questions.  I am not sure what is Tim's schedule for tomorrow, but at least Kirk and myself will be around. 

Obviously cutting sims is not the best options but we are considering all alternatives at this time.  We will continue to review how to cut labor and expenses.
One question that it would be good if you think about it before we meet is as follow.  Is BRM ""core"" to the Enron for next few months or new organization?  Please consider the costs of finishing this project.


Sincerely,


Yevgeny Frolov

"Market Insight: Gradual Uptrend Anticipated","
 [IMAGE]  Market  Insight for November 19, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Global Online Financial Services Firm      Introducing  Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm Research  As a TD Waterhouse customer,  you now have online access to Goldman Sachs PrimeAccesssm  Research. Just login at  tdwaterhouse.com , click on 'News & Research', and then  on 'Goldman Sachs'.  Gradual  Uptrend Anticipated By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The Outlook   We see further  but slower market progress.  Tired  after their recent run, stocks nevertheless are being supported  by signs that the economy is stabilizing, better news from Afghanistan  and a large pool of cash reserves earning meager returns. The  two-steps-forward, one-step-backward recovery since September  21 hasn't created the enthusiasm that would necessitate an early,  nasty correction. Investors, keeping in mind that every rally  of the past 19 months has ultimately failed, are regaining their  confidence only slowly.  Background  conditions don't lend themselves to a strong advance in the near  term. While recent data suggest that the recession will be mild  and will end early next year, risks to this forecast are high.  Another terrorist attack could deepen consumer gloom. The possibility  of the disruption of oil supplies still exists. The fiscal stimulus  package continues to be bogged down in partisan bickering.   Treasury  bond yields, moreover, have turned sharply higher, spurred by  the less dire economic reports and by chart breakouts. Yields  have quickly retraced the September-October decline.  S&P  technical analyst Mark Arbeter is impressed by the recent stock  market action and anticipates higher levels over the intermediate  term, but he believes the easiest and quickest gains are behind.  Arbeter sees a likely substantial amount of stock for sale when  Nasdaq (currently at 1898) moves into the 1920 to 2300 range and  the S&P 500 (now at 1139) reaches 1170 to 1300. He expects  it will take time to chew through this supply.  History  also suggests limited near-term upside potential. Three months  after the low points of the nine postwar bear markets, the S&P  500 was up an average of 14.9%. The index is already up 18% since  the September 21 low. Six months after the nine postwar bear market  lows, however, the ""500"" showed an average gain of 24.4%;  12 months after the lows, the index was ahead 34.5%, on average.

"Conference Call Today with FERC Staff","A conference call was held today with FERC staffers to discuss items of interest or concern to us.  Participating for FERC were Bob Pease (enforcement att'y), Stuart Fisher (economist) and Bruce Poole (engineer).  Alan Comnes, Dave Perrino and I weighed in for Enron.  The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

"Market Insight: Restraints Will Be Overcome","
 [IMAGE]  Market  Insight for December 24, 2001  From    [IMAGE]    The  Global Online Financial Services Firm  Please  note, the Market Insight will not be published next week. Have a safe and happy holiday season!     Deadline for Converting to a Roth IRA  December 31, 2001 is your deadline for converting a Traditional  IRA to a Roth IRA. You should consult with a tax professional  or accountant to help you determine if a conversion is advantageous  for you. For assistance, please call 1-800-934-4448, press  4 then 4 to speak with a Retirement Plans Specialist.  Restraints  Will Be Overcome  We see an  irregular upward trend in the market.  Stocks  face some formidable hurdles. The risk of additional terrorism  and fresh memories of the market's 18-month downward spiral are  inhibiting buying. So are dismal fourth-quarter earnings pre-announcements  as the economic cycle approaches bottom, as well as continued  high P/E ratios on recession-depressed profits. In addition, the  supply of stock for sale at prices just above current levels is  heavy, according to technical analysts.   But  we expect that these and other impediments will be overcome. And  we note that market recoveries that proceed in halting fashion  amid widespread skepticism often are the most sustainable.  Congress's  failure to pass a fiscal stimulus bill is not a major negative,  according to S&P chief economist David Wyss. The economy will  recover anyway, says Wyss, with absence of the package pinching  GDP growth in 2002 by only 0.2%. Without fiscal stimulus, the  chances of a 12th fed funds rate cut on January 30 are improved.    Based  on Wyss's forecast of GDP turning positive in the first quarter  and improving to an annual growth rate of 5% in the fourth quarter,  investors should be getting more encouraging news before long.    The  recent rally lost upward momentum when it bumped up against overhead  resistance at 1170 on the S&P 500 on December 5. With the  help of turn-of-the-year reinvestment demand, the next attempt  to work through this supply is likely to be more successful, says  Mark Arbeter, S&P chief technical analyst. But even if it  is, the area of resistance runs all the way up to 1313, so Arbeter  believes further progress in the period ahead will be labored.    We  think the S&P 500 and Nasdaq will see double-digit gains over  the course of 2002. A portfolio allocation of 65% stocks, 20%  bonds and 15% cash reserves remains appropriate.

"Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants","Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.

Ken

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.

"GMC's Bold New SUV","
			Sponsored Content	
[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE] 	 Envoy: GMC's Bold New  SUV      The GMC Envoy is one of the nicest surprises of the 2002 model year. It  represents a comprehensive improvement over its Jimmy predecessor, making  it one of the most competitive mid-sized SUVs on the market.   The fact that it is still ""truck-based"" - which essentially refers to the  full-frame construction that makes its Yukon big brother such a beefy  workhorse - does not mean that this SUV rides like a truck. Quite the  contrary, the Envoy is smooth and refined in a way that would have been  unthinkable just a few years ago. Of course, the market in which the Envoy  competes has become packed with excellent choices, with everyone from Acura  to Mercury entering the fray. We drove an Envoy SLE 4WD to find out how it  stacks up.

    SONY ON DVD FENCE... NEW LOOK FOR LINUX... MS SERVERS
ATTACKED...

    The battle over which DVD format will
    become the industry standard wages
    on. Sony's weighed in on which one it
    prefers, but its stance is hardly decisive.
    Also, a new graphical interface for
    Linux and other Unix-like OS's has arrived,
    and a worm is wreaking havoc on Microsoft

  WHY A 'PATCHWORK' APPROACH TO SECURITY IS RIGHT
  FOR YOUR BIZ

   If you're concerned about keeping your network
         safe from hackers, crackers, and worms, there's
         an easy way to do it: stay up to date with patches.
         But most organizations don't have a patchwork
         plan. Lee Schlesinger explains why that's
         important--and shows you how to take the right
         approach.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Randy,

Why is there a PG&E Citygate position in Mgmt-West?  Were these positions created in the last week or so?  Can you print a forwards detail and move these deals into FT-PGE?  Do not just transfer at mid market.  Please move the deals.

"How to pick an all-in-one: It's the form factor, stupid","

_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

HOW TO PICK AN ALL-IN-ONE: IT'S THE FORM FACTOR, STUPID

    I'll say it straight up: There's no perfect
         device (yet) that combines a cellular phone
         and a PDA. So finding one you can live with is
         always a trade-off. My advice? Choose form

"Bishops Corner","Phillip,

I need to get the contract for Galaxy and Grande executed today. In addition
I will need to close the loan at the title company in Hays County this week.
If you elect me vice-president of Bishops Corner, Inc., I can take care of
all of the documents.  From a logistics standpoint this probably would be
the best way to handle it.

Please let me know today if possible so I can send them to the lender.


Sincerely,


Greg Thorse

"Huntley update","Greetings Phillip,

I received your phone message.  Thanks for the update.  I have been talking
with contractors and Spring Valley.  At this point we are trying to
determine whether the addition over the garage would be workable.  Heather
probably told you that I am meeting with a contractor on 11/7 at your home
to get a firm bid on the project.  I spoke today with the Spring Valley
building consultant and faxed him some detail.  There are a couple of
possible problems he is looking at and we'll possibly need to get a variance
from the decision makers when the time comes.

In the meantime, I printed out the earnest money contract and sellers
disclosure forms from the website you found.  We are waiting on the final
word from Spring Valley to move ahead.  I'll let you know when we have some
new information.

Thanks,

Bob Huntley

Bob,

I do have a survey of the sight at home.  I will get you a copy tomorrow.

Regarding contracts, the Texas Real Estate Commission website has copies of
the contracts we need.  The website is below.  I believe the relevant
contracts are form #20-4(One to Four Family Residential Contract) and form
#OP-H (Seller's Disclosure of Property Condition).  A coworker is about to
close on a home without using a broker and these are the forms he used.

     I forgot to ask if you have a recent survey of the  lot from when you
     closed?  I would like to see if we'll have any easement  problems

"BUSINESS ALERT: AMR Posts Big Loss","__________________________________
BUSINESS ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


October 24, 2001

AMR Corp. reported a third-quarter loss of $414 million, its largest
quarterly shortfall ever, blaming the ""disastrous financial effects"" of the
terrorist attacks and the continuing weakness of the economy.

Meanwhile, Sears, Roebuck and Co. said it will cut about 4,900 jobs in a
broad restructuring plan, as the retailer reported a 5.8% profit drop.

Eastman Kodak Co. announced plans to cut 4,000 jobs while reporting a 77%
decline in net and warning that fourth-quarter results may miss analysts'
estimates.

"ANCHORDESK: Why the idea of an ID chip makes my skin crawl","

_____________________DAVID COURSEY_____________________

WHY THE IDEA OF AN ID CHIP MAKES MY SKIN CRAWL

    Dogs, cats, and cows have them now, so how long
         could it be before a surgically inserted ID
         chip comes to people? In the case of the new
         VeriChip, the answer is how long it takes for
         the FDA to approve it. This is an example of
         a technology that could help some people--but
         hurt lots of others, too. Let me explain why
         the VeriChip should give you shivers, too.

    XP HEATING UP?... DON'T COPY THAT CD!... 'NEW YEAR' WORM
HITS...

    How's Windows XP doing? Not so hot on
    the retail front. But that doesn't mean
    it's going to be a flop. Judging by license
    sales to PC makers and businesses--a
    better measure of an operating system's
    success--XP may become Microsoft's
    best-selling OS yet.

  WANT BETTER WORKPLACE SECURITY? JUST USE SOME COMMON
  SENSE!

   Yes, almost every electronic device emits
         radio noise that can be eavesdropped by your
         enemies. But is this really your company's
         biggest security worry? Robert says no. Your
         real concerns are much more mundane--like
         closing your shades.
