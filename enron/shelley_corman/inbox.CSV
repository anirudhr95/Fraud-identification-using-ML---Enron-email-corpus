Please review my intended calculation method -- I figured for every 5 minute scan that was over 1000 that they were flowing at that steady rate for 5 minutes.  

I only applied the $10 penalty to the 5 minute volumes that were over the specified rate.

"ETS Daily Market Summary Update","9/27/01

 All ETS Daily Market Summary Users,

If you are not aware, we have been working to convert the ETS pipelines Daily Market Summary (DMS) Report to a new Business Object format and are finalizing the testing phase of this project.  The DMS conversion will be in production beginning October 2, 2001. 

If you received this e-mail, you currently have access to the ETS Daily Market Summary (DMS).  You may still access the current ETS DMS report and continue to use your current ID and password until 10/2/01.  Beginning on 10/2/01, your ID for the current ETS Daily Market Summary will no longer be valid and all ETS DMS users and administrators will be required to use your corporate ID and password to access the new ETS DMS report. (Your corporate ID and password is what you use to login to the Enron network) 

The ETS DMS will continue to be in the same location after 10/2/01, on the ETS Intranet at <http://www.ets.enron.com/> under the dropdown ""Applications"" / ""Daily Market Summary"".  Any new users that need access to the DMS will be required too sign up for access through   <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>.

If you have any questions or comments on this conversion, please call me at 31527 or email toby.kuehl@enron.com <mailto:toby.kuehl@enron.com> 

Attached is a brief tutorial on the new DMS report.

	FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION

Texas Gas Transmission Corporation   				Docket No.
RP01-278-002
                                                      
	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the ""e-Filing"" link.

There were 2 places in the order that left me scratching my head:

para. 32 - Pipelines will have to waive non-critical penalties for bumped
shippers.  I thought Order 637 was supposed to rid pipeline tariffs of
unnecessary penalties.  I don't know what ""non-critical"" means as applied
to our post-637 tariff.

para 61 - I can't tell if the new rule is applicable only to releases
implemented after the effective date, or will it also apply to existing
recallable releases that do not have a condition precluding intra-day
recalls.

Ordinarily, we could try to use our compliance filing to clarify such
things but here FERC has dictated the tariff language we have to use.

We haven't decided whether to seek clarification.  Our business folks are
still looking at this.

>>> <Nancy.Bagot@dynegy.com> 03/15/02 04:03PM >>>

I'm wondering if anyone has discussed or thought about filing for rehearing
or clarification on this rule (which would be due April 10, I believe).

"Monthly Cash Out Reconciliations","Shelley,

By tomorrow morning I am pretty sure I can have the period Aug 2000 through Jul 2001 Cash In/Out reconciled (roughly) with the PNR and the large PPAs accounted for for each month.  

Attached is what I have summarized so far.  Please go to the last worksheet tab called ""SummaryCashInOutStats"".  I have also finished summarizing within each month the total Cash Out qty and the total Cash In qty and priced each at the appropriate cash in/out price.  Since the imbalance quantities are broken out, the actual cash settlement per customer will vary some from actual as the cash in/out mechanism nets the quantities by customer first before applying a cash in/out rate to that customer.  

Thx, Jim

"Re: FW: Greetings from Houston, TX","Dear Shelley, 

What an exciting story!  I am sure that you are anxiously awaiting being reunited with Alina.  I know that the bureaucracy for an international adoption can be quite extensive.  We had some good friends who adopted a little girl from an orphanage here in Almaty and they worked really hard to be able to do so.  I hope that the procedure will come to a closure soon so that you can come to bring her home with you!   

I was, indeed, able to travel back to Kazakhstan last month without any significant problems.  I was on the first BA flight Houston-London after the attacks, so the lines were huge, but there was no problem with the flights themselves or with security.  It just took more airport time.   

In Kazakhstan, the situation is currently peaceful.  The government here seems concerned with protecting its borders and American interests.  We are in contact with the American embassy here, and have made contingency plans in case the situation deteriorates, but we feel fine about remaining here at this time.   

Please let me know if you have any specific questions. 

Sincerely, 

Catherine

"RRS - Proposed Accounting Timeline","During the March 7 meeting we reviewed the 'Proposed Accounting Timeline', which is part of the Project Update dated March 7, 2002.  The proposed timeline at the bottom of the page shows that 'Imbalance Trading Ends' on the 16th calendar day of the month.

GISB Standard 2.3.41 states that imbalance trading should be allowed through at least the 17th business day of the month.  The language of the standard is as follows:

""Standard 2.3.41 -- Transportation Service Providers should provide the ability to post and trade imbalances until at least the close of the seventeenth business day of the month.""

This timing will need to be incorporated into the timeline.

"FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes","            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	Attached is a file with a page for each month showing cash in's and cash out's with totals for each and detail of each. 
These are volumes after bookout.  I pulled this information from TSS Invoicing for each month and sorted it by volume amounts.  The majority\minority categories are based on the numbers of customers that were in either cash in or cash out, rather than on the volume.  If the majority\minority categories are based on volume, then three months change: Oct 00, Nov 00, and April 01.

	Let me know if this is what you needed or if there are other reports I can pull.  I will also send this to Jim Studebaker, maybe he can incorporate it into his spreadsheet of prices.

"RE: Cash-Out Analysis","Shelley, I have been looking throught Galen's numbers for July 01 and I have found four cash out payments with quantities totaling 1,457,146 mmbtus.  These were payments to Dynegy and Texaco Natural Gas.  I am running the invoice log to see if it will tell me what kind of payments these were -- I suspect these are for ParkNRide and maybe OBA cash outs in the supply area. 

Shown below (and also attached) is a spreadsheet to reconcile the July 01 numbers.   Galen, I think we will need for you to go back through the numbers you provided for each month and exclude any quantities that have to do with PNR and with supply area OBA cash in/out payments.   

I will still need to reconcile the original market area imbalance numbers that I provided earlier with any PPAs and other adjustments that are included in the Balance Before Bookout imbalance quantities for each month.  My original list of market area imbalance quantities did not include any PPAs.  Thx, Jim   

July 01 Imbalance Quantities vs Cash In/Out Summary Quantities										
										
Dkts										
(210,403)	Net DPOA imbalance for July 01  (this is the number I originally provided)									
85,349 	PPAs included in the Balance Before Bookout stmts for July 01 (mostly measurement adjmts)									
(125,054)	Net Subtotal Market Area Delivery Imbalances for July 01 including PPAs (from BBB stmts)									
										
12,784 	Net Subtotal No Notice Imbalance for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
44,262 	Net Subtotal Receipt Imbalances (Supply Area) for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
7,535 	Net Subtotal Western Div Delivery Imbalances for July 01 (from BBB stmts)									
										
(60,473)	Net Total - Actual July 01 net imbalance for all imbalance types									
										
										
1,457,146 	Possible PNR and OBA cash out quantities for July 01 pmts to Dynegy and Texaco									
										
1,396,673 	Net of above two quantities									
										
1,390,164 	Net from Galen's Cash In/Out summary for July 01									
										
6,509 	Unreconciled difference (I have not been able to figure out this difference)

Subject:	Cash-Out Analysis

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

Attached is the start of the communications plan.  There are many more issues to cover but the balance will be how much detail to provide executives.  

Let me know where you want to go from here.

"IT Weekly Tip - Use vCards to share your contact info with clients and businesses","Below is a training tip on creating electronic business cards and links to training documents on Windows 2000 and Outlook.   Each week a training tip is added to the documentation, and I will foward on as new topics are added.  

I would be happy to do brown bag training sessions at lunch or as time permits on topics of interest.   If you have any questions or would like me to setup a session, please give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )
	- Find and select your name
	- Double-click your name or click Properties
	- Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep. 
2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard
	- Close any open messages
	- Click Tools, Options, Mail Format, Signature Picker
	- Click New and then type ""vCard"" for the name
	- Click Next and then click New vCard from Contact
	- Find and select your name, then click Add ->, OK 
	- Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name
	- Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create)
Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go. 

Sending an E-mail with your vCard
	
	- Create a new e-mail
	- Click Insert, Signature, vCard to insert your vCard 
	- Send your e-mail 

Receiving a vCard via E-mail

If someone outside the company sends you a vCard, how do you quickly add it to your Contacts folder?

	- Double-click on the vCard icon in the e-mail (this will bring up the new contact properties)
	- Add any additional information you wish
	- Click Save and Close

"RE: Cash-Out Analysis","Galen, I think you can get the break out of receipt (supply area) imbalances vs market area imbalance from the monthly excel spreadsheets in the common directory (p:)FGTUSERS/FGTMktg/... under Lindley (the place you directed me to earlier today).  I took the spreadsheet for July 01 and sorted it by imbalance type (i.e. Market Area, No Notice, Receipt Point, etc) for my reconciliation.  I think this will get you the numbers Shelley is looking for (the market area imbalances - positive and negative).  Jim

Subject:	Cash-Out Analysis

Galen/Jim,

Thanks for the info.  I have been building spreadsheet cases all day.   FYI - majority/minority isn't driven by the number of shippers, its driven by the volume.  I made the appropriate changes on Galen's spreadsheet.


A couple of further things that I need:
- I need to reconcile the net volume on Galen's sheet by month with the net cash out volumes on Jim's sheet.  There are huge differences.  Can these really all be receipt imbalances?

Galen for the months Aug 00-Jul 01 can you break out receipt imbalances from market imbalances.   We are only planning to put the majority/minority pricing on the market area imbalances.


Let me know if you guys want to sit down and talk through this.  I need to get Teb my final analysis by the end of the week.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

"Order RM96-1-019 (Partial Day Recalls) - BPS Schedule is Official & Pipeline Segment Meeting","Following is info on BPS, Pipeline Segment and EC meetings in April / May.

FYI - On the Triage call this afternoon, Kim announced the following BPS
schedule for dealing with the recall order:

** Wed 4/3 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central - agenda - only to identify
the issues and not to work on any of the issues at this point
** Wed/Thurs  4/10 - 4/11 face to face @ Con Ed in NYC
** Wed 4/24 conference call 8:30 - 12:30 central
** Tues/Wed 4/30-5/1  face to face in Houston - probably @ CMS 

Kim indicated that on the 4/24 call we'd know better what additional
meetings might be needed. I suggested that since the Technical and IR are
meetings are in Houston Mon May 13 (Tech) and Tues/Wed May 14-15 (IR), that
if there needs to be another face to face about that time, that we could
possibly have it that Thursday and Friday (May 16-17) in Houston. Stay tuned
on any dates after the May 1 meeting. 

Kim is going to try to have the NAESB office post this schedule this
afternoon.

**  Kim also asked me to remind everyone about the Pipeline Segment meeting
to prepare for the BPS meetings (see her e-mail of 3/15/02)
Date:          3/27/2002
Time:          9:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. central
Location: CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line
          5444 Westheimer, Houston, 77056
          Please check in with the 7th floor receptionist.

Conference calling will be available.  If you have not done so already,
please send Kim an email letting her know if you will attend in person or
via conference call.

**  Last but not least, April EC meeting - the NAESB web page shows it as
being a 2-day meeting - Thursday 4/18 and Friday 4/19. I confirmed with Jim
Buccigross this morning that it will only be a one day meeting on Thursday
4/18 in DC.

Have a great weekend and keep those travel departments busy. Just think
about all the wonderful places you can go as your frequent flyer accounts
build up this year!

Here is the file you sent me with the following changes:

1.  Question 1: added a comment line after the column headings explaining that Interruptible contracts may be extended from month to month unless terminated on 30 days' notice by either party.  Mary Kay thought we needed some explanation why those contracts showed termination dates in the past.  I eliminated this line, along with the headers, on the CD version of the file.

2.  Question 3:  I just changed the alignment on the text cells for the 3 comment records at the bottom from Centered to Left.

MOTION TO INTERVENE
The AGA Petition raises issues that are directly related to the operation of pipelines. 
2.      Enron operates a number of interstate pipelines subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act.  In some cases these pipelines are wholly-owned subsidiaries, in other cases Enron is a part owner.  These interests are collectively referred to herein as the Enron Interstate Pipelines.
The Enron Interstate Pipelines have currently pending Order No. 637 compliance filings and may be affected by the outcome of this proceeding, and thus have a direct and substantial interest in this proceeding that cannot be adequately represented or protected by any other party.  Thus, the Enron Interstate Pipelines' participation is in the public interest. 
III.
COMMENTS
            The Enron Interstate Pipelines wholly support the Response of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America filed this day and incorporate the comments made therein.
            Like INGAA, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with both themes of the AGA Petition.  First, the Enron Interstate Pipelines take issue with the procedural request to implement the new capacity release timeline separately from Order No. 637 proceedings or GISB compliance filings.  Second, the Enron Interstate Pipelines wish to once again voice concerns about the far-reaching impacts of the flowing day recall rights that the AGA petition advocates.   
            Rather than repeat those concerns again here, we have attached a copy of comments that were submitted to the GISB Executive Committee during the discussion of whether GISB should remove the current prohibition on partial day recall rights.  
            For the reasons set forth in both INGAA's response and the attached comments of the pipeline segment, the Enron Interstate Pipelines ask the Commission to deny the AGA Petition.

From:            Pipeline Segment
 
Re:            Business Practices Subcommittee Priority Action Items 1 and 2 and R00026 
 
 
At the scheduled December 14, 2000 GISB Executive Committee meeting, the agenda includes a discussion and vote on Recommendations and Proposed Standards.  This agenda item contains certain BPS proposals related to implementation of Order No. 637 requirements and related standards such as R00026.   Among the proposals are new or revised standards for capacity releases and recalls which include support for intraday capacity releases and would remove current GISB restrictions against partial-day recalls. 
 
Our fundamental concern with the proposed standards is that they do not fully address the far-reaching impact of flowing day recalls.  There are significant operational concerns with these standards.  We are concerned about whether the operational provisions are in place to ensure that the recalled party does not continue to flow, particularly during critical periods.  We are concerned about whether current GISB communication time frames are adequate for handling the ripple effect of flowing day recalls across the grid.   The proposed standards address only one narrow operational concern - whether gas has been scheduled on the particular contract to be recalled.  This does not begin to address the operational challenges of the recall or the potential impact to other transactions across the grid.  
 
Given these operational concerns, we do not understand the rush to adopt flowing day recall standards.  While we understand that this work is in response to R00026, we do not believe that flowing day recalls are necessary to fulfill the scheduling equality requirements of Order No. 637.   Order No. 637 requires that replacement shippers have the same nomination opportunities as shippers acquiring original capacity.  There are no existing pipeline contracting or scheduling functions that are the equivalent of the recall of capacity by a releasing shipper. Very few pipelines have received authorization to sell hourly services and most pipeline tariffs prescribe a uniform hourly flow rate throughout the day.   Further, most pipelines have not yet received approval to implement balancing provisions to address daily price fluctuations or intraday variability. 
 
In the spirit of compromise, we have worked on and concurred with revised standards that permit intraday releases.  However, under these revised standards, all capacity release options continue to be available only on Business Days to insure that the proper contractual relationships and notice provisions are supported.  Nonetheless, throughout the negotiations on this compromise approach, the pipelines have made it clear we cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards.  
 
Aside from our opposition to the flowing day recall standards, the pipelines have agreed to other recall standards that are more liberal than are supported by the existing standards.  In this area, we have agreed to support a revised standard which will permit capacity to be recalled for transactions in the Evening Nomination Cycle.  This allows a releasing shipper to recall capacity until the afternoon of the day prior to gas flow.  While this timeline supports a shorter notice for recalls, it still preserves the application of the full-day contract entitlement and gas flow rights for both the releasing and the replacement shippers.  Flowing day recalls, though, are a separate issue.  Flowing day recalls could significantly increase the incidence of scheduling problems, overruns, imbalances and increased occurrences of Operational Flow Orders.  Because of the potentially disruptive nature of flowing day recalls, pipelines cannot support the proposed flowing day recall standards. 
 
Any move from daily increments of service to partial-day increments of service must be undertaken in the context of all services offered on each pipeline system, including firm services, interruptible services, and balancing and operational provisions. Because these developments involve changes to tariffs and customers service offerings, this is not an area that is currently ripe for GISB development.
 
The attached Pipeline Segment position paper incorporates the concepts identified above into the BPS recommendation and is offered as an alternative to the BPS recommendation.

Gary - I will ask my assistant to set up an appointment after I hear back from you.  I would indeed like to attend, but at the very least the individual handling our securty surveys, Mark Ringwelski, will be there.

I should tell you that Mark's boss, Kyle Norosky, has been in contact with the VP who is responsible for Gas Control (her name escapes me at the moment).  You might want to talk to her to ensure we are not running parallel efforts.  I will wait to hear from you before scheduling the appointment.

John, I've been told that you handle security for the Enron building now. I'd like to meet with you this week to give you a tour of the facility and discuss some of my concerns regarding the Enron Gas Control area on EB42. They are listed in my notes below. I am particularly interested in arranging for a security audit of the area by a security professional. In the past the facility security was included as a small part of the IT audits.

Let me know when you would be available to meet.

Thanks, Gary Kenagy

Steve, 

Back on September 17th I sent you the note below asking for guidance and assistance on some security issues. I haven't gotten any response from you. The facilities help desk did get the service elevator monitor in Gas Control fixed. I would still like to work with someone to address the bulleted issues I listed in the original note below. In addition to those, there are a couple more issues that have surfaced recently. 

1) Given the planned restacking of the building and the significant increase in employees housed in EB, how does this impact the evacuation plan for the building when a complete evacuation is required?  [Woods, Steve]  Compared to our present population at Enron Center North (EB) the population will actually be less once all moves are completed.  [Woods, Steve]  The evacuation we completed on 9-11-01 after the N.Y. disaster went very quickly and without incident. 

2) How are we supposed to be notified after-hours of weather related or any other events that security considers a threat to the building where they are recommending evacuation?  During a recent weather event we were inside Gas Control (I believe it was Thursday evening, 09/20) and we did not get any notification, but we have been told that security was on a number of floors telling employees to evacuate due to a tornado threatening downtown. [Woods, Steve]    Security console is supposed to notify Gas Control when weather approaches,  we have reviewed these procedures and they are in place.  I will ask security to follow up on this issue. 

Let me know who to work with.

Thanks, Gary

FYI...   Jim Gearhart and Enron Net Works have removed all non-EDS contractor authorized access to all computer rooms, including Ardmore.  These contractors will remain without access until an Enron background investigation is performed or it is verified that an Enron background investigation has already been performed.

Steve, 

Who do I initiate conversations with to review the physical building security issues listed below? Recent events would suggest that we need to
be auditing these issues routinely. I assume you have worked with Wackenhut consultants or some other organization to perform these types of 
reviews in the past. These issues are generally addressed as secondary issues in the IT audits, but I think it might be best to address physical security reviews using qualified security professionals, rather than IT auditors. Bob Hagen and Jean McFarland are working on some significant enhancements to our existing Business Continuity processes and this would fit right in. Please let us know who we can work with to begin the review of the issues
below ASAP.

By the way, I called the facilities help desk with two issues last week and haven't heard back from anyone. The EB42 service elevator lobby video 
monitoring  from the Gas Control Center is not working, and the service elevator doors on EB40 do not lock properly. 

Thanks in advance for your help, 

Gary  x33094

What are the current risks of unauthorized personnel or visitors attaining access to the Gas Control Center and/or related computer rooms and telecommunications rooms?
What are the current physical security policies and procedures for these secure areas? How can these be strengthened or improved upon?
Does the current Gas Control Emergency Reaction Plan adequately address potential threats due to breaches of security? 
Who in the Enron organization is responsible for routine daily management of security and who is responsible for longer term planning?
How are security issues communicated? Preventative measures? Early warning?
