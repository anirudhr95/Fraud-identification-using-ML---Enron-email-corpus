"RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002","Ray and ISAS -

Just going through the past four days of email, so please excuse this
response if it has been already addressed.

What was said at the Jan 17th meeting of the ESWG was, I (Bob Harshbarger)
was not prepared to address the issues surrounding voting, membership, etc.
at that meeting.  

ESWG will have to adopt some form of structure if we are to proceed as
quickly as the ESC.  The ESWG was formed at the direction of the Joint
Guidance Committee.  We have been asked to consider formalized or structure
membership based on the same guidelines that ISAS has been given.  The
intent is not to leave anyone out but to ensure we can address issues in a
timely manner.

There is no perfect solution.  A weighted sector voting structure does
appear to give broader voice to the masses, yet even within a single sector
the participants can opposing view points and still feel under represented.
What the ESWG adopts is to be seen.

"RE: ISAS Meeting Agenda 2/14&15/2002","Bob,
 
I appreciate your input.
 
The OC Steering Committee has asked us to become more effective. We need to do our best to satisfy their request.
 
Our goal is to ensure we get the best product in the most efficient manner we can. ISAS has always had voting members. These members have determined the outcome of issues that the group is responsible for. I believe the current voting structure of ISAS is typical of the Operations Committee and the Sub-committees reporting to the OC. An OC member has the ability to appoint one representative from his/her company. In at least one case in the WSCC, an individual company has two OC members. One member represents the transmission/reliability side and one member represents the merchant side. 
 
Diverse opinions often lead to the best decisions. The intent of focusing on the voting members is to make the most of the limited time we have to make decisions. Non-voting members will still have the ability to take the floor to voice their views. However, the discussion will be limited so that we can complete our business. I suggest that we see how the February meeting goes. We can discuss proposed changes to the format prior to the next meeting. However, these changes must still comply with WSCC guidelines and OC direction.
 
The Joint Guidance Committee is currently revising the ""Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces.""
The proposed revision is attached.
 
Thanks.

Steve, 
  

We have some concerns regarding the format you suggest for the upcoming ISAS meeting which consists of the agenda and discussion being driven primarily by the voting member.  As you know in PNM's case (and others) we have only one WSCC membership. Our Merchant and Reliability functions are still under the same company as required by current laws and regulations.  We do however operate as totally independent shops thus having different tasks, issues, insights and etc.  Neither shop is able to sufficiently represent the issues of the other.  

We are concerned that by limiting discussions to only ""the voting member"" much insight will be lost.   We would be interested in hearing from both sides of a company on issues.  I would suggest this committee consider structuring discussion and voting privileges along the lines of those being set up in other industry forums {ESC, GISB, NAERO, NAESB and etc.} where a company represented in WSCC would have voting/discussion privileges for representatives from each business sector.  In WSCC that should include at least a Reliability and/or a Merchant rep.(if applicable) even if the company holds only one WSCC membership.  

I do understand and support the need to control the size of this meeting and would not want to see decisions made strictly from votes by those in attendance. We feel it very important to have fair representation in the subcommittee of all concerned entities.  

I have been trying to find someone at WSCC who is involved with revision of the document titled ""Guidelines For Administering the Membership of WSCC Subcommittees, Work Groups And Task Forces"" which you indicated was being revised.  I have not been able to find out who this person is and am unable to find anything about it on the WSCC web site...could you provide a name?  As you know, this document has not been modified since 1991.  We would like to make sure the revisions reflect the needs of all the industry as we know it today.  We have some thoughts and concerns which we would like considered in the revision process.

"1.7 Full Registry for testing tomorrow update","
	All,
	The registry for testing tomorrow is posted at the NERC 
	site http://server06.nerc.com/tag/. It has been updated 
	and SHOULD contain all correct information. If anyone 
	has any problems, speak up ASAP. 
	The registry has some minor changes:
	1) Data Types and lengths have been added.
	2) Constraints have been added.
	3) 2 new tables have been added, 
	    Pending_Desk_Registry and Pending_Entity_Registry
	4) The field 'Pseudo_CA' has been added to the PSE
	    and CA Registries.
	5) Relationships between tables has been implemented.
	6) SC Codes are mapped in the SC_Code field
	    for CAs.
	
	Please read notes on changes below:	
	a) It only impacts the MDB. If you use the CSVs, everything 
	     will be the same (except for the new tables and the one 
	     new field). 
	b) The new tables (Pending Entity, Pending Desk) do 
	     NOT need to be used. Rather, they are ""value adds""
	     that can be used by a vendor to aid their customers. 
	c) The intent of this is so that anyone using the MDBs 
	     will not have to go parse everything into dates, 
	     integers, etc... it does not change anything else.

	The data dictionary posted on the E-Tag site contained 
	an error in the order of fields in the POR/POD table.  
	The order should be as follows:
		PORPODPointID
		NERC_ID
		PointName
		TP_Entity
		CA_Entity
		PORPODRoleID
		CreationDate
		DeactivationDate
	A new Data Dictionary will be posted with the corrections
	ASAP.
	
	Thank You,
	Paul Baratelli

In item 1 of your email, what I think you describe here sounds like NERC's
""functional model"" or what came out of the CACTF work.  In that model they
said that check-out was only between GCAs and LCAs - intermediate CAs
(balancing authorities) would not need to know of the wheel throughs.
However, the TP function(s) from source to sink would need to see the tag to
manage their respective transmission assets.

I hope that what is described here is not NERC's functional model.  My
control area, too, is not prepared to change check-out and accounting
procedures suggested in the CACTF's work.

Perhaps, embedded in the 1.7 registry tables there are pointer's to/from TPs
to/from CAs and this is why intermediate CAs are optional in OATI's tag
agent.  However, as you point out, there is not a one-to-one correspondence
of TP to CA or vice-versa within the WSCC.  I hope that there are experts
out there that can answer this item and tell us every thing is going to be
all right.

Items 2 & 3 seem to touch on a current debate going on in the NERC IS and
TISWG email forums on extensions of tags.  From those discussions, one thing
seems to be clear, once a tag reaches its stop hour and that transaction
ends, it is considered finished or in 1.7 speak, Dead.  It can not be
restarted or extended.  However when where how much an extension be for is
still be debated.  

Hope the answers come soon, seems a bit late in the game to have so much
uncertainty out there.

"E-Tag 1.7 Spec Concerns","ISAS Members and Interested Parties,

Last week, Raymond Vojdani raised some very valid concerns about the E-Tag
1.7 Specification. SRP found some time to research these issues. Our
comments are attached. 

Raymond, 
Thanks for bringing these issues to the WSCC's attention.

Hi Steve,

As we approach the impending implementation of E-Tag 1.7, we have begun
reviewing and studying the new features of the Tag Services interface as
explained at the NERC Workshops and as developed by our vendor, OATI. 
The implementation of the E-Tag 1.7 Specifications has raised some
questions.

1. On the section of the tag where the PSE creates the Physical Path
for the transaction, there are required fields for the Generating
Control Area, the Load Control Area, and the intermediate Transmission
Providers.  There is not a requirement to document the intermediate
Control Areas (there is a location to include them as Scheduling
Entities, but those fields are optional).  This would seem to be a
significant obstacle to providing all Control Areas the information they
need to perform hourly schedule checks with their neighboring Control
Areas.  Also, in WSCC, where certain Control Areas are responsible for
managing constrained paths, this would be an obstacle in determining
scheduled flows across the constrained paths.  It is possible (even
likely) to create tags where the Control Area would not see the tag,
because the transmission used is owned by Transmission Providers other
than the Control Area.  Was it the intent of the NERC E-Tag 1.7
Specification to remove intermediate Control Areas from visibility and
approval of the tags?

2. Once an E-Tag has been approved, and has achieved the Implement
state, it appears to have immortality.  Even when the 'final hour' of
the current version of the tag has passed, the tag does not appear to be
inactive; it is available for the creating PSE to access and extend by
an Adjust request.   This feature could potentially bog our system down
with numerous tags that are presently 'inactive' but always available
for adjusting.  Did the NERC specifications intend for an Implemented
tag to eventually become 'inactive' and unavailable for adjustment?

3. A related concern to tag Adjustment Requests; under E-Tag 1.7, a PSE
may now create a tag and accomplish ongoing scheduling through the
Extension of the tag by adjusting (oh, boy, account number scheduling
has returned).  At the NERC E-Tag 1.7 Training Workshop, the Timing
Requirement for Profile Changes, WSCC, is 15 minutes to evaluate any
early notice.  This could be a significant business change; the PSE can
accomplish preschedule functions by requesting tag extensions (15
minutes evaluation time) rather than creating new tags (3 hour
evaluation time).   The clear distinction between Next Day schedules and
Real Time schedules is being lost.  Perhaps the evaluation time of an
any Profile Change Request could be linked directly to the impact time
of that change request, similar to the timing requirements for
submission and evaluation of New Tag Requests.

Considering the above shortcomings, especially item #1, it is
impossible for us to move toward implementation of E-Tag 1.7, for, we
will not be able to  check out the net interchange with our neighboring
control areas or be able to manage the constrained paths in our control
area. Please give me a call should you have any question or if you want
to discuss this further.  Thanks.
