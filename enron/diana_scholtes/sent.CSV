"RE: Questions about changes for the Chapter11.exe","What we are looking at is cleaning up for December.  So the schedule strips have already been created.  For settlement purposes, we have to go in and clean house.  So it wouldn't help to change the deal in Deal Entry and  I'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation.  So we are looking at a time strip for example Dec 8-31 to zero out ""Counter party"".  

I will be talking to John tomorrow morning to find out more about the West Bankruptcy book.  Don't know anything about it.

Thanks again,

Diana

Subject:	Questions about changes for the Chapter11.exe

Good Afternoon Diana,

Did I capture your question correctly?

The users want to update the chapter11.exe program, that was developed to 'zero-out' schedule strip volumes for a given counterparty for a given day, to allow the users to zero-out the volume for a range of days?


IT Questions
1.  Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.  So, based on the current design, the date range, at least looking forward, would only be a couple of days.
- Option 1:  Maybe, instead of zeroing out schedules, we should adjust the dates on the deal.  This would prevent schedule strips from even being created after a certain date?

2.  Working with John Postlethwaite & Stacey White, Will Smith has a program that converts deals from the real Enron books to a newly created West Bankruptcy book.  Will this work for you guys?

Anyway, just give me a call when you get a chance.

Thanks,  David Poston

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

I've seen this one before, but it's always funny...

BEER
I have not seen anyone explain this as well as Cliff Clavin, on Cheers.  The
Buffalo Theory as told by Cliff Clavin: One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff
Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm, and here's how
it went: ""Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only
move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the
slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural
selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and
health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the
weakest members.  ""In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as
fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know,
kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain
cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker
brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine."" That's
why you always feel smarter after a few beers

It has been my privilege to have been able to work with and represent you in the various western region forums that were of interest to Enron.  I want to wish all of you the best for the future and if any group of individuals can make a new Enron work again it would be you.  I have learned a lot in my brief tenure at Enron and it has been especially satisfying working with professionals like each of you.  Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again.
 
Happy Holidays to you and your families.  Also, if someone could also pass along this message to Cara S. in scheduling it would be much appreciated. (I cannot remember how to spell her last name...sorry Cara!)
 
Kindest Regards,
 
Dave

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

Per our discussion yesterday, these are the people we have identified who will parallel test the consolidated position manager, after an initial limited production release, against results from whatever tools they are using in production today...

EAST		WEST

Smith Day	Kysa Alport
Corry Bentley	Kate Symes

Only the East guys have participated in early testing in our test environment.  Generally, it is much easier for everyone to test against production data once the app is migrated.  The data in test is pretty ugly.  Since CPM is new and does not update anything, we have no problem moving to prod for further testing once the app is stable.

Glad to discuss...

Steve

Hi Diana and Sean:

I believe we didn't buy/resell with NCPA for 10/1/01-10/3/01.  Although we are good in scheduling (no activities scheduled) there are some volumes showing up in deal entry side (""view actuals"" tab).  In order to make sure that at month end settlement processes will be smooth for these NCPA buy/resale deals, I would like to ask the scheduling group to zero out those volumes for 10/1/01-10/3/01 in view actuals in deal entry, but I need you to give me the green light first.  Your confirmation will be appreciated.

Thanks,

Most men will never quite figure out why the sexual urges of men & women differ so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars & Venus thing. And, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with their heart.  And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene gets thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words ""I do"". One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says, ""I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me."" I said, ""WHAT??"" So she says the words that I and every husband on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, ""What was her first clue?"" I finally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. The very next day the we went shopping at a big unnamed department store... I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them. She then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond earrings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't even play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was OK. She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have seen her face when she said, ""I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register."" I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, ""No, honey. I don't feel like buying all this stuff now."" You should have seen her face ... it went completely blank.  I then said, ""Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while."" And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, I added, ""You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a Man."" I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the spring thaw.

Are you at all interested, and secondly would you and Sean consider residing
in Bethesda performing the exact same function you are both performing
today?  The second option is a long shot but I wanted to run it by you.
Hopefully you had a pleasant Holiday.   John

Diane -

I'd like to clarify the type of information Real Time needs in order to fulfill positions for the short term desks. 	As we're all sadly aware, PGE has become increasingly frustrated with our confusion regarding delivery points when we do lending and parking deals with them, so it is imperative that any information included in an e-mail to Real Time corroborates with data entered into Enpower. Following are the discrepancies I see between Enpower and the information given to Real Time:
 
1. On Sunday, according to Enpower, STNW is long on peak @ PGE System. The deal number that would be relevant to Real Time in this case would be the purchase (855033, not 855032). That way we can link our real time sales to the day-ahead purchase in Deal Scheduling. Also, Diana confirmed that this length should be sold off @ Mid-Columbia, not PGE System, which is not what is shown in Enpower. 

2. On Monday, according to Enpower, STNW is short 53 mw on peak @ Mid-Columbia. The relevant deal number here would be 855044 - again, we only need to know the deal number that corresponds with your position. Also, since anything that alludes to the wrong hours, delivery point, or deal number only serves to confuse the traders on shift, I was thinking it might work better if we sat down and went over these positions together before sending anything out to the group. (This is what I do with Holden when STSW does lending or parking deals.)

Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.

Thanks,
Kate

Diana:

Today I reviewed NCPA related deals for 11/1-11/6 and found:

11/1 => good
11/2 => somehow the lightload sale side (deal 517676.1) is only showing HE1-HE6 in the scheduling system now.  I wonder if someone deleted HE23-HE24 afterwards (*on the lightload purchase side we have both HE1-HE6 and HE23-HE24, deal 517673.1).  
11/3 => good
11/4 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/5 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
11/6 => annuity missing (no power delievered)

Please let me know if you could restore the HE23-HE24 for 11/2 back in the scheduling system if they should be there, also please let me know when the missed annuities are entered.  I have also attached my worksheet for your convenient reference.

Everyone is completely disappointed and mostly pissed off.  I'll have to give you the inside scoop sometime when we get together!  And we need to!  I'll be traveling around making my rounds to find out what's in the market place soon. So, hopefully I'll get a chance to see you.  Any chance of you and Mark coming down?  We have plenty of room for the two of you; you're always welcome.  I love your house!  Thanks for sending the picture.  Its so exciting but its also a lot of work!  I'm glad I'm done!  It's nice to be in the house, but also funny all the work and effort you put in and how exciting it is all those months while you're in the process....all to be completely indifferent with it afterwards!  Its very strange, but what to do?  Natalie, I can't believe is 3!  And a very terrible 3.  My hands are full!  I'm contemplating of putting her in ski school this winter.  She quite the daring child, so I think she'll enjoy.  Ask Mark for me if this is too young.  She won't think so, its mostly my fear. =)  You'll get a kick of the pictures I've attached.  One of them is my depiction a young Penny Lane. Hopefully you saw Almost Famous to understand my analogy!  You'll also notice the Beagle that Bill bought for Natalie.  HAHA! His name is Presley.  She's absolutely in love with him. 

Keep in touch!

Hi Diana...haven't spoken to you in awhile so thought I'd drop you a note.
Hope all is well amongst this crazy market and confusing time.  

I assume you are in your new house and wondered how you are enjoying it as I
can't really imagine EVER moving in.  I am sure it will happen one day!
Below is a picture Mark took yesterday (just proof that it is really moving
ahead!) and thought I'd forward to you...perhaps you could give me your
opinion, based on it's current stage of construction, how much longer I
might be at my in-laws!?!?!?!?

Take care!

To our customers and counterparts:

As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
area.  

The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
cream cheese for our programmer.

I heard back from Gwen and she has given me these deals to be fixed according to Modesto's spreadsheet.

Sales
875830.1.2 and 875819.2 Need to have a price of $29.00 11/7-11/30

Purchases
875830.3 and 875819.3 Need to have a price of $31.00 11/7-11/30

The deals above total 15,200 mw's.   The deals that could be the problem are  transmission deal 860363.1 at a $0.00 and Purchase annuities 859311.1 and 859389.1 @ $1.36, these deals total 15,200 mw's.

Also, starting on the 7th we need to put in losses of 36 mw's per day using the Dow NP15 index price.

let me know if you have any questions and what I can do to help.

Sent:	Thursday, November 29, 2001 5:27 PM
To:	All US DOMESTIC & EXPAT EMPLOYEES@ENRON
Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

To our customers and counterparts:

As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
area.  

The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
cream cheese for our programmer.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 208-388-2243.

Thanks,
Lisa

Diana,

I heard back from Gwen and she has given me these deals to be fixed according to Modesto's spreadsheet.

Sales
875830.1.2 and 875819.2 Need to have a price of $29.00 11/7-11/30

Purchases
875830.3 and 875819.3 Need to have a price of $31.00 11/7-11/30

The deals above total 15,200 mw's.   The deals that could be the problem are  transmission deal 860363.1 at a $0.00 and Purchase annuities 859311.1 and 859389.1 @ $1.36, these deals total 15,200 mw's.

Also, starting on the 7th we need to put in losses of 36 mw's per day using the Dow NP15 index price.

let me know if you have any questions and what I can do to help.

This year, the onsite interviews are scheduled for two Saturdays in November.  On each Saturday, the top 9 - 12 candidates from our local schools will be present.  This will help tremendously with our cross-calibration process.  The dates and schools are as follows:

		Washington State University

	Saturday, November 17, candidates will be drawn from:
		Portland State University
		UC Davis (Associate candidates only)
		Oregon State University

We will need you to participate in at least one of these Saturday events.  We will also need 5-6 people to overlap and attend both Saturdays, so please volunteer if you are able.  (PS:  If we don't have enough overlap, we will have to begin ""drafting"", so please help out where you can.)

TASK ITEM:  Please respond to this message, indicating which Saturday(s) you will be able to attend.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thank you in advance for your help.  It is very much appreciated!

Diana,

Would you be available to help me with the Assoc / Analyst recruiting this week?  We are going to Portland State this week.  

Here's how it works:  There is an Info Session on Thursday at 5:00 PM and interviews on Friday.  The Info Session is from 5:00 PM  --> 6:30.  There is a PowerPoint presentation which explains Enron's business  which depending upon how many questions, usually takes from an hour to an hour and a half.

Then, Friday morning, we are only interviewing in the morning from 8:00 AM to 12:00 Noon.  The interviews are 1/2 hour each.  You should be back to the office before Noon. 

Would your schedule allow you to help me out?

This just came to me today.  This information is widely available to corporations and law enforcement around the country.  It will likely hit the media in the next day or so.  This is all the information that is available.

Enron Corp. Business Controls/Corporate Security received the following information via the National Threat Warning system.  While we do not wish to unduly alarm employees, the specificity of the information dictated immediate dissemination to our West Coast offices.  

THE FBI IS IN POSSESSION OF UNCORROBORATED INFORMATION INDICATING THE
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,
SPECIFICALLY THE WEST COAST.  REPORTEDLY, UNSPECIFIED GROUPS ARE
TARGETING SUSPENSION BRIDGES ON THE WEST COAST.  SIX INCIDENTS ARE TO
TAKE PLACE DURING RUSH HOUR BEGINNING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 2 AND CONTINUING
THROUGH NOVEMBER 7, 2001.

NO FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THIS ALLEGED ATTACK IS KNOWN AT THIS TIME.
THE FBI IS ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY THE VALIDITY OF THIS REPORT.  RECIPIENTS
WILL BE UPDATED AS EVENTS WARRANT.

RECIPIENTS WHO RECEIVE OR DEVELOP INFORMATION RELATED TO THIS MATTER
SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CONTACT THEIR LOCAL FBI OFFICE.

We will keep you apprised if we receive any further information.

Enron, according to Dr. Seuss...

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold.
And told all the employees to hold.
While they made billions, they continued to say
Our company will be the greatest someday.

But lo and behold it would not come to pass.
It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass.
""How could it be true?"" we all asked.
""All we do is buy and sell gas"".

But to make their personal billions
They had to keep in the dark their minions.
So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled
Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold.

But they found out the scam
And put the company in quite a stew.
They told Ken and Andy ""we have lost confidence"".
Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do.

The old man in charge said ""we all trust Andy, he's fine,
He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!""
Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see,
And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee.

But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act.
He told Andy, ""You must go on leave""
Is he still on the payroll we asked?
We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last.

Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that
Were on the faces of all but the crooks.
The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three,
They had been cooked a total of four.
And many suspect even more!..

He went into the elevator, that old gas trader.
He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside.
With two armed guards standing at his side.

And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith
And went into the boardroom forthwith.
There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling.
Where with their cronies they devised great scams.
How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams.

And with one more scam to do
He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck.
""Chuck"", he said, "" I'm in quite a jam, can! you please
help me I got caught in my scam"".
So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side,
First with some money and took Ken as his bride.

But that old scoundrel had played too many scams
This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides
Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise.

There were no trades, there were no counterparties.
There were no assets, there was no Christmas party.
And so Chuck went to Ken and said ""Your company
Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you.
Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies!

And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought.
He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot.
Four thousand to be exact.
We thought he has lost gazillions,
but prior filing he managed to bonus
his friends fifty eight Million.

And so we are told, the company will be back.
A shell of itself but not quite the same.
The shell is appropriate as we all know,
The core business of Ken is a shell game.

Diana,

As a follow-up to our discussions earlier this week, Sally Long (Al Paschke's assistant) called me this morning to inform me that 

1.  TBL ""inappropriately denied our tag last week.""

2.  She has ""educated a few people"" so this won't happen again.


Let me know if you have any further problems.

INTERCHANGE SCHEDULING and ACCOUNTING SUBCOMMITTEE


Dear JGC, OC, WMIC and ISAS,

On November 29, 2001, the WSCC Joint Guidance Committee (JGC) approved
formation of a new working group to coordinate western positions and/or
proposals on Electronic Scheduling issues and practices.  This new working
group (called the WSCC Electronic Scheduling Work Group or ESWG) will
report to the JGC and coordinate with the OC, WMIC and ISAS.  Attached
please find the ESWG Scope Statement.

As many of you are aware, the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative currently
being facilitated by NERC is moving forward at a rapid pace on many issues.
In order to be more productive and proactive with the formation of
electronic scheduling issues and practices, the ESWG would like to make you
aware of this new group and invite your participation and assistance to
more adequately ensure a broader representation of WSCC interests.  To this
end, if you are interested in being an active member of this work group, or
if you are interested in being on the email exploder for this group, please
reply to this email as follows:

Please provide (via reply to this email):
1. Your name and organization
2. Your email address
3. Yes/No for being an active member (i.e. - you will provide comments,
attend meetings, etc as feasible)
4. Yes/No for being on the ESWG email exploder (you will receive all emails
of the working group)

Please note - if your name is listed below, then you will automatically be
added on the working group email exploder and there is no need to reply to
this email (unless you want to be removed).

"RE:","Michael,

I had a family emergency that I had to attend to prior to the holidays.  So I apologize, I haven't been in town.  Not sure what happened with our pre-arranged days to have discussions with your prospect, but hopefully we can reschedule.  Considering my situation now with my family, I will not be looking for a re-location anytime soon, but rather something either in Portland or within the West.  If Exelon is willing to explore opportunities with that in mind, then please set some time aside to discuss.  You can continue to reach me either at home (360-834-3579) or at work (503-464-3807).  I no longer have a cell phone available at this time.  Thank you for your time.  Hope your holidays were good.

When E-Tag 1.7 is activated on March 6, 2002 the OATI webTag (ETS) system will require secure access using an OATI Digital Certificate.  OATI Digital Certificates will be provided to our existing webTag customers at no additional cost under their existing ETS Agreement.

"E-TAG Survey","Bill, 

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.

We appreciate people's concerns about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these concerns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to talk to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college recruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.  We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a presence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are uncertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best long term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have already made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our belief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to emphasize the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will interview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions based on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider the potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron employees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enron who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause for a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final architectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives the build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this project, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, or delay again.  

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, reliable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up the success of this office.

It was a Laird Dyer deal and you were going to see if you could find out how we would settle it.  I am not sure if the two deals are related, but maybe they are?

  Can you look over these numbers and tell me if you agree with Modesto.  Given everything that has happened lately, I'm not sure who is correct.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Gwen,

Please confirm my November 2001 numbers.  I show that MID purchased 26,800 MWh's at $2,089,704.00 from Enron and MID had sales to Enron of 23,520 MWh's at $2,225,962.36.  If you agree with my numbers, I will net invoice Enron for 3,280 MWh's for $136,258.36.

"RE: October detail","Sales to PGE:

10/3	After you put in the lending for this day, I agree we are still out by 150 mw.  Its down to two schedules; can you check to see what you show for the Montana buy/resale.  This should be 32 peak everyday.  The other for the day is our pge system to grizzly this should be 26 mw peak.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/5 & 10/6   You show 200 more llh....I don't know why????

10/8	The 200 mw you show llh should be a total of 256 (32 llh due to colstrip).  Call me to go thru the hourly at your system to find our 2 mw descrepancy.  You have the correct number of MW's coming to us but not going to you. 

10/9  You show 8 mw @ 24.20 under To BPA-EPMI RP-LS-MC account.  Don't know what that is?  You also only show it on one side??

I'll send more when i get thru it!!

10. You're guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.

9. If you get tired, you can wait ten minutes and go at it again.

8. The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.

7. You don't have to compliment the person who gave you candy.

6. It's okay when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else,
because you ARE someone else.

5. 40 years from now you will still enjoy candy.

4. If you don't get what you want, you can always go next door.

3. It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.

2. Less guilt the next morning.

 .....AND the #1 reason,

1. You can do the whole neighborhood!!

 Happy Halloween ! Be safe!

Understanding Enron

FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.

FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the milk.

PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

APPLIED COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

MEXICAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.

EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company. The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Enron, according to Dr. Seuss...

They exercised and sold, exercised and sold.
And told all the employees to hold.
While they made billions, they continued to say
Our company will be the greatest someday.

But lo and behold it would not come to pass.
It was all a fraud and scam most would call crass.
""How could it be true?"" we all asked.
""All we do is buy and sell gas"".

But to make their personal billions
They had to keep in the dark their minions.
So they lied and cheated, stole and cajoled
Analysts, investors, workers and sold and sold.

But they found out the scam
And put the company in quite a stew.
They told Ken and Andy ""we have lost confidence"".
Little did they know, that confidence is what cons do.

The old man in charge said ""we all trust Andy, he's fine,
He made me my fortune and never charged a dime!""
Andy got paid to manage illegal partnerships you see,
And for that he collected thirty m! illion as his fee.

But the pressure was on, and Ken had to act.
He told Andy, ""You must go on leave""
Is he still on the payroll we asked?
We get no answer. Seems Andy will be there to the last.

Ken restated his books, and oh the looks that
Were on the faces of all but the crooks.
The books had been cooked! Not one year, not two, not even three,
They had been cooked a total of four.
And many suspect even more!..

He went into the elevator, that old gas trader.
He hit floor fifty, where his offices reside.
With two armed guards standing at his side.

And so he rose to the top of 1400 Smith
And went into the boardroom forthwith.
There were the ghosts of Fastow, and Skilling.
Where with their cronies they devised great scams.
How to deceive, cheat, and steal millions of clams.

And with one more scam to do
He picked up the phone and called his friend Chuck.
""Chuck"", he said, "" I'm in quite a jam, can! you please
help me I got caught in my scam"".
So old Chuck bit a nd came to Kens side,
First with some money and took Ken as his bride.

But that old scoundrel had played too many scams
This one he could not hide as Chucks lawyers and guides
Went over Ken's books and found such a surprise.

There were no trades, there were no counterparties.
There were no assets, there was no Christmas party.
And so Chuck went to Ken and said ""Your company
Is a sham. It was all lies. I cannot merge with you.
Your firm is a rotting carcass festering with flies!

And so Ken thought. He thought and he thought.
He will file Chapter eleven and fire a lot.
Four thousand to be exact.
We thought he has lost gazillions,
but prior filing he managed to bonus
his friends fifty eight Million.

And so we are told, the company will be back.
A shell of itself but not quite the same.
The shell is appropriate as we all know,
The core business of Ken is a shell game.

It was a Laird Dyer deal and you were going to see if you could find out how we would settle it.  I am not sure if the two deals are related, but maybe they are?

Subject: RE: Business Practice #11



I have to tell you more than you want to know to preface this response. 
There are 5 hydro projects in the Mid-Columbia region. These 5 projects are owned and controlled by 3 control areas - Douglas County PUD, Chelan County PUD and Grant County PUD. Some of the generation from these 5 projects has been sold on a long-term basis to several participants. I'm not familiar with the term ""take away rights"", but every mwh generated at these 5 projects is either used for load in the 3 control areas or it is moved away to participant's control areas. The fact that some want to represent their share of generation as being part of a ""single bus"" and claiming it can be moved away without naming a transmission provider does not accurately represent the transfer of energy from one control area to another. Douglas, Chelan and Grant are the only control areas at the Mid-Columbia with other adjacent control areas.

Each participant has transmission capability (either their own or purchased) to transfer their share of generation from one of our control areas to their own. These transmission paths serve one of two purposes. 1) dynamic schedules or fixed schedules to serve load or 2) transfers for sale or resale.

The ""single bus"" idea at the Mid-C will soon be correctly represented for 4 of the 5 projects. Chelan and Grant plan to combine their control area boundaries (for scheduling and tagging purposes only) and call it the Mid-C HUB. This HUB is registered as a TP with NERC as MHUB and will accomodate transfers of energy BETWEEN participants. All other transactions will require other transmission to move energy OUT OF the Mid-C HUB. Douglas County PUD is not part of the Mid-C HUB or MHUB.

""For transactions that occur at only one bus (i.e. no OASIS/GF transmission 
involved) use a willing TP on the second line with the same PSE as on the 
first line and the words ""Single Bus"" in the OASIS reservation field and 
""7-F"" as the Product."" 

Is this practice not being practiced?  I've seen/heard that at the MID 
Columbia folks selling energy to those who have take away rights at MID C 
are have their tags denied because the tag creators are not using a ""TP 
specific transmission path or designation"".  It was agreed to use ""Single 
Bus"" in these situations to avoid the implications of transmission service 
where no transmission service was necessary from the MID C. 

If the sink control area is bringing the energy back to their system at that 
point then the sink should have it indicated that it's not a single bus for 
their transmission portion, but may be ""GF"" or ""No reservation required"" 
from the bus to the system.  But in this circumstance then the path is not 
MIDC-MIDC but MIDC-SYS.  That's my take.  Others wish to pipe in?

Subject:	Update

There have been no ""official"" developments relating to Enron North America or the Portland office that I am aware of since the floor meeting on Wednesday.  The news of the Europe office closing so suddenly has certainly been unsettling.  Absent any tangible news pertaining to the fate of our office I thought that I could, at a minimum, try to explain to people what I've seen going on over the last couple of days.

On the trading side we are doing several things.  First, we are trying to honor as many of our physical delivery obligations as possible.  Several customers have stopped making deliveries to us which is making it impossible for us, in turn, to honor all of our physical deliveries.  In these circumstances we are constantly updating our customers on the status of their schedules so that they can make alternative arraingements.  The Cash Trading, Scheduling, Services, and Real Time groups are doing an unbelievable job with this.  I am impressed at how capable, professional, and calm our team has remained.  On the Term Trading side we are working with our customers to close out positions.  This process is going very smoothly as well.  We traded a record volume yesterday as our customers reduced their exposure to us.  The Term trading team has done an excellent job with this.  Third, on the Middle Market and Origination side we are trying to work with customers to bring cash in the door.  Many customers owe us money due to out of the money future positions.  Many customers would prefer to settle up with us now rather than in bankruptcy if that is what ends up happening to us.  We have brought a significant amount of cash in the door as a result of these efforts and saved our customers from going through a potentially onerous bankruptcy proceeding.  I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination and Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.

On the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the North America gas and power businesses.  While it is impossible to handicap anything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this front.  Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.  I don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what form the core business takes as a result.  Chris Calger and I have been part of the team talking to our potential suitors.  We will both be in Houston through the weekend and into early next week working on this.  We will update people as soon as possible as things unfold.

I know that this situation really sucks.  Given the anxiety and uncertainty that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and staying positive.  I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from here -- most likely in the next week or two.  Please hang in there.

Tim

Subject: !!! OATI Etag 1.7 Minimum Requirements !!!


Time is running very short.  Is your company prepared for Etag 1.7?  These are the minimum REQUIRED steps that must be completed prior to March 6, 2002:

---------------------------

(1)  All entities must update the NERC Registry at http://www.tsin.com.

(1a)  CA's and TP's must designate PORs and PODs that are valid on tags.

(1b)  PSE's must designate associated scheduling PORs and PODs.  See http://www.tsin.com or inquire with NERC for details.

---------------------------

(2)  All OATI Users must have functioning OATI Digital Certificates.

(2a)  Without the certificate you cannot access Etag 1.7 after March 6, 2002 at all.

(2b)  Inquire internally to determine if a supervisor has already contacted us.

(3b)  To begin the process of acquiring OATI Digital Certificates, please complete this document and send it to OATI:

http://www.oaticerts.com/repository/Company_Information.doc

---------------------------

Failure to complete these steps will result in a partial or complete lack of tagging access and capability!

For additional information on these and other critical Etagging issues, please visit OATI's Etag 1.7 Information Page at http://www.oatiinc.com/etag17.

"January Settlements","Leslie,

I'm trying to get a jump on making sure we have everything done properly in Enpower for the month of January.  My question is whether we, the West desk, should enter any changes in Enpower due to OUR non-delivery and/or incremental deals?  We have everything recorded on our Trade sheets, but if it would make it easier for you to settle or relay to the Estate by us making the changes in Deal Scheduling, we can do so.  

I also understand, after talking to John, you will be using our Trade sheets for such changes for the month of December.  I'm not sure who you would like us to assist in translating our sheets, but if you can call me, we can set up a conference call and I'll coordinate from each desk to attend.  

If there is anything else that you need us to do to help your group please let me know.
