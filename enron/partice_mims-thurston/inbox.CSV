I did not enjoy it either, I'm glad you said it first.  I'm going to look
up that Clarins Spa and see if I can afford it and then maybe we can go
together.

I'll let you know what I find out.

   Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after
   you.
   I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
   burning rubber.

   Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
   grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
   she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
   early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to
   pray
   for her.
   How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

   We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to
   Institute
   Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

   I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the
   problem
   was.

   Hey Sister Sims,

   You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
   rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a
   hard
   time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need
   to
   look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

   How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going
   well
   for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for
   Jordan
   and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very
   immature.
   She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

   You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials
   and
   talk.

   Write back

      Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, ""Wow""!!  It has to
   be
      EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo
   crazy.
      Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you
   weren't
      in
      Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it
   make
      you
      feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
      feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

      I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd
   call a
      plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

      I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on
   Sunday?
      I
      was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
      with
      the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
      Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
      all
      the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

      After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was
   giving
      a
      small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
      Steve
      asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how
   much
      he
      loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
      also
      apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to
   Siera
      for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way
   he
      treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her
   for
      speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I
   felt
      like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
      what.
      He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
      snuggle
      up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
      immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, ""Why""!  He
      then
      jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
      he's
      6 yrs. old.  I said, ""Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
      just
      go on & get out of here.""  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
      ask
      where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just
   really
      don't have time for his mess.

      So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

      Hey girl,

      What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
      could
      have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last
   night I
      had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
      they
      had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It
   was
      nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their
   at
      6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and
   seating
      at
      6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But,
   girl,
      Ms
      Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
      semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my
   favorite
      stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my
   floor
      length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The
   top
      that
      I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!
   I
      wore
      my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the
   ones I
      wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
      heel
      sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
      When
      I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
      ""Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
      husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan
   take
      some
      pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

      We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home,
   Todd
      said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
      entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

      Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
      was
      wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
      she's
      back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

      How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe
   we'll
      get
      a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be
   home
      until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to
   Power
      Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
      too.
      Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing
   much.
      All
      we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule
   different,
      independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean
   break
      and
      new environment.

      Oh well, talk with you later!

      Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

         Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've
   been
         extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
      report
         card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
         sickness.
         I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God,
   but
      she
         still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.
   The
         4th
         grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted
   up
      in
         prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
      she's
         dumb
         and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
      letter
         last
         night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because
   she's
         not.
         She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That
   hurt
      me
         so
         bad.

         Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.
   The
         best
         thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

         How's the school search going for Jordan?

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Our Questions","Dear Bill,

Thanks for your offer to help us out in our modeling efforts.  I hope that we can share our analysis with you in return.  Below are some questions that we would like to understand in order to better model the ammonia industry.

In our model we divided the industry to production, consumption, and storage.   The storage, especially, is a concern to us because we have almost no understanding how much storage there is.  How much storage is in the fields and how much is with the dealers.  Also the consumption is very tricky.  We are not quite sure how to understand the logistics of what really drive the consumption.  I am aware that corn requires the most nitrogen out of all plants.  However what else drive the decision of using ammonia as fertilizer I am not sure.  How price elastic is the consumption, etc. 

In order to ask the questions in order, I would like to summarize them as follow:

How much storage for ammonia is in the US?
How is the storage distributed among producers, dealers, and farmers?
From farmers view, what are the most important decision factors for using ammonia and at what amount? 

From the manufacturer perspective, what are the factors that are considered when starting the production and what are the factors considered when shutting the production down.  I assume it is not only the differential price between ammonia and natural gas.

Bill, I believe it may be easier just to talk about these questions, as there may not be a simple answer to any of the questions.  I will call you in the afternoon, but feel free to call me at 713-345-1763.

"FW: Midwestern 12/01","Patrice,

Lisa Kinsey mentioned you may have information on the cancellation of ENA's transportation contracts on Midwestern.  Midwestern has an expiration date of 12/31/01 for the two contracts on the Dec. invoice (contract 30349 & 31468).  Do you agree with that end date or should they have an end date of 11/30/01?  Any information you could provide would be of great help.

Thanks for the information.  We did receive an invoice for Dec production on contract 30349 and 31468.  I called my contact at MGT and their system shows an expiration date for these contracts of 12/31/2001.  Do you have any further information or documentation that could help me out?

Enron had gotten out of the contract on Midwestern effective 11/30/01.  There should be no business on Midwestern for December 01.

"Re: Crestar AOS assignment to BP","Dan, as per my voice-mail, I talked to Hunter and he confirmed that Enron
would notify BP/Crestar via e-mail by 9:45 MST of the contracts with
associated volumes. On the chance that Enron cannot notify BP/Crestar or
fails to take, and BP/Crestar incur penalty costs then Enron would pay for
those as per point number #2 below ie.,

[ (2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.]

Hunter agreed as long as there is a reciprocal clause that Enron is
compensated when BP/Crestar fail to nominate by the 10:30am MST Timely
cycle deadline and Enron incurs costs, then BP/Crestar would pay those
costs.

Crestar and BP both agree with the reciprocal cost provisions. Now it is a
matter of where the language should go. I think it should be in the Enron
contract.

Please advise if you agree and how we should proceed to include the
language in the Enron contract.

Thanks,

Grant, I think you need to get involved and explain to Patrice's people the
agreement we have in place currently. Mark does not give us the information
via e-mail on a consistent basis by 9:45am, however the agreement states
that. To date Crestar has been accomodating to Enron but once BP comes into
the AOS agreement the 9:45am deadline will need to become more formal.

Gentlemen, please advise what Enron's position is. I think Mark's last
comment on same makret veveryday would accomodate the defualt contract
number request we originally had in the agreement.

Patrice:
I am unable to commit to knowing what our downstream contracts will be by
the 10:45 deadline that they have set fourth.  In the event that we sell to
a market at the point and there is a long daisy chain involved we may not
get the ultimate downstream contract until 11:15 or sometimes even
intra-day.  I will make every effort to get the downstream info. to
BP/Crestar/Gulf Canada however, I do not think we should take penalties if
our markets are slow providing us the information.

The only solution would be to take our supply to the same maket every day.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject:  Crestar AOS assignment to BP


Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

"Chicago - O'Hare","Per Your Request:

Average Monthly Temperature - Basis Normal:

May 2000:  +3.1
May 2001:  +1.1

From a demand standpoint:
 - May 2000 - Heating Demand:  There were 13 days with a minimum temperature below 50, 6 days below 45 and no days with a minimum below 40.  There was 1 day with a maximum temperature below 50: May 19th featured a maximum temperature of 48 degrees.  The lowest maximum temperature was 48 degrees on the 19th and the lowest minimum temperature was 40 set on the 14th.  There were no periods during the month where the minimum temperature dropped below 45 degrees for 3 or more consecutive days.
- May 2000 - Cooling Demand: There were 8 days with a maximum temperature 80 or higher.  3 days reached maximum temperature 85 or higher.  The warmest maximum temperature was 86 degrees on May 6th.  There was one stretch of 3 consecutive days where temperatures were 80 or higher - May 4, 5, and 6.

- May 2001 - Heating Demand:  There were 17 days with a minimum temperature below 50, 9 days below 45, and 3 days below 40.  The lowest minimum temperature in the month was 37 on the 13th and lowest maximum temperature was 57 on the 12th and the 27th.  There were two stretches of 3 or more consecutive days with minimum temperatures below 45 - May 11, 12, 13, 14 and May 23, 24, 25, 26.
- May 2001 - Cooling Demand:  There were 8 days with a maximum temperature of 80 or higher.  4 days reached a maximum temperature of 85 or higher.  The warmest maximum temperature was 89 on the 16th.  There were two stretches of 3 or more consecutive with maximums 80 or higher - May 1, 2, 3 and May 15, 16, 17.  May 15, 16, 17 each featured temperatures of 85 or warmer.

Comment:  I think that May of 2001 should have prompted more overall demand than May of 2000 based on the more extreme nature of heat and cool. 

June 2000:  -1.3
June 2001:  To Date: -11.1
                        Forecast for the month:  -3 to -6

From a demand standpoint:
- June of 2000 - Heating Demand:  There were 4 days with a minimum temperature below 50 and no days below 45.  The lowest minimum temperature was 45 on June 3, 5, 6.  One period during the month featured 3 or more days with a minimum temperature below 50; June 5, 6, and 7.
- June of 2000 - Cooling Demand:  There were 12 days with maximum temperatures 80 or higher.  5 days reached 85 or higher.  No days over 90.  The warmest maximum temperature was 89 on June 8.  There was one stretch with 3 or more consecutive days over 80, June 8, 9, 10, 11.  This stretch also featured 3 consecutive days over 85.

- June of 2001 - Heating Demand:  To date:   There have been 5 days with a minimum temperature below 50 and no days below 45.  June 3, 4, and 5 were consecutively below 50 for minimum temperatures.  Forecast:  The forecast through June is likely to bring at least 3 and as many as 6 more days with minimum temperatures below 50.
- June of 2001 - Cooling Demand:  To date:  No days 80 or higher.  Forecast:  June 7 through 20 will likely bring fewer than 4 days with a maximum temperature over 80 and 2 or fewer days over 85.  No days are expected to top 90 before June 20.  No stretches of 3 or more consecutive days over 85 are expected before the 20th.  Long range forecasts would indicate that it is unlikely that any significant stretches of heat will impact Chicago through the end of June.

Comment:  With below to much below normal temperatures continuing for much of June 2001 - cooling load will be less than June of 2000.  I'm not sure exactly how much the increased heating load will off-set the total monthly demand.

Let me know if I can help more...

"RE: Slow Day","
Girl please.  I don't know all those hyms myself.  I left right after you.
I tried to flag you down in the parking lot, but no, Sis. Thurston was
burning rubber.

Siera's doing much better in math, but she's had a few, low language
grades.  She's only been tutored once.  Today will be the 2nd day and
she'll be there two hours instead of one , because Steve picked them up
early on Monday, forgetting that she had tutoring.  Please continue to pray
for her.
How's Jordan doing?  What did his teacher want this time?

We really do need to go to a spa.  I have a gift certificate to Institute
Clarins inside Saks Fifth in the Galleria.  I'll use that soon.

I really didn't enjoy rehearsal last night.  I don't know what the problem
was.

Hey Sister Sims,

You were really singing those hymns last night!   How long did choir
rehearsal last?  I had to go, I was sleepy and, quite frankly, had a hard
time really getting into the hymns for that length of time.  I do need to
look up some of those 2nd and 3rd verses though.......

How is Siera doing in school these days?  I hope everything is going well
for her.  I still need to get out and look at this other school for Jordan
and see what's going on over there.  His teacher is really very immature.
She called me again yesterday with some silly stuff.

You know we need to set aside some time to go get massages and facials and
talk.

Write back

   Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, ""Wow""!!  It has to be
   EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
   Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't
   in
   Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make
   you
   feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
   feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

   I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
   plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

   I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?
   I
   was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
   with
   the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
   Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
   all
   the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

   After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving
   a
   small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
   Steve
   asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much
   he
   loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
   also
   apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
   for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
   treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
   speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
   like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
   what.
   He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
   snuggle
   up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
   immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, ""Why""!  He
   then
   jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
   he's
   6 yrs. old.  I said, ""Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
   just
   go on & get out of here.""  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
   ask
   where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
   don't have time for his mess.

   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

   Nytasha

   Hey girl,

   What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
   could
   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
   they
   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating
   at
   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,
   Ms
   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
   stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
   length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top
   that
   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I
   wore
   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
   heel
   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
   When
   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
   ""Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
   husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take
   some
   pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
   was
   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
   she's
   back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll
   get
   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
   too.
   Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.
   All
   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
   independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break
   and
   new environment.

   Oh well, talk with you later!

   Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

      Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
      extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
   report
      card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
      sickness.
      I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
   she
      still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
      4th
      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
   in
      prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
   she's
      dumb
      and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
   letter
      last
      night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
      not.
      She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
   me
      so
      bad.

      Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
      best
      thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

      How's the school search going for Jordan?

Stephen,
 
At this time,  ENA chooses not to bid on your RFP for the reasons listed below.
 
Mid 5: NNG/ GPM Linam Ranch 1709 is not a liquid point and it would not be prudent to sell where we do not have the reserves to back it.  The other issue is the NNG-TOK Index is not traded frequently and therefore the posting may easily be manipulated.  
 
The alternative plan is to allow ENA to sell Mids 1 though 6 up to the volume US Steel requires to meet system needs and to price it off of a Demarcation Index (a frequently traded Index).
 
If you have any other questions or comments, please call me.  
 
 
Best Regards,

Well, Robin isn't pleased at all.  She thinks that he's extremely rude and
arrogant.  I have mixed emotions.  I enjoyed most of his songs, but I won't
like his style all the time.  There has to be a mix.

He wants her to take her lunch, while he goes to the bars and buy drinks and go out on Friday or Sat to the clubs and spend more money, not to mention what he wastes money on other things.  Maybe I am missing something.  He does not know I am taking a half day today.  I think I am going to drive down and park and find a quiet spot and just read the word and pray.

everything going this morning?  What is your state of mind?  Are you
feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive?  If you are feeling
apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that

Lindsay,

I have saved the requested Energy Atlas maps on:  O:\_Dropbox\fraley\PDF.zip.  I have included all of them except for Ohio-IOU, Ohio-LDC, Ontario (Central), and Ontario (Western).  I am having some technical problems with exporting .PDF's for these files.  Please look them over and let me know what you think.  

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Have you tried the internet?  Have you tired any old friends?  Surely,
someone knows him or know's where to contact him.  Come on girl, let's go,
go. go!  You REALLY need to find him!  Please write back and tell me his
full name,  Does he have gas service in his name at Nicor??  Does his momma
have gas service with Nicor or do they live in the city?  Come on!!!

   Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to
   remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy
   here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.
   His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so
   that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual
   activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He
   would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i
   told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last
   statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from
   this day forward.

   I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look
   at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.

As time progressed, things eventually were discussed regarding me that did not go well for Lonnie.  It is definitely not okay for him to talk to me (because of my past relationships) and I don't want to cause any more confusion for him with Tony.  Itsn't this childish!!!

"RE: Enron's Proposed Modifications for Parental Guarantee","
Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     "" . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand.""

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, ""Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty"".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   ""must pay within 5 business days"" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted ""excluding choice of law provisions . . . ""
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

"Edison Mission Marketing & Trade","Hi Patrice,

I have an issue with Edison Mission and I saw your name on a deal (1094593) from October so I thought I could ask you about it. It looks like the deals are on a month to month basis. They paid us $5M back in February and each month we deduct their invoice from this balance. They called Max in Credit (x.58261) and want their money back. So, I am fully prepared to wire them their money back, I just want to make sure all the people involved are aware. Credit is going to request an invoice from them stating what we owe them. When that comes in someone in credit will sign off on this request. I just want to make the front-end aware of what's going on. Do you know who else does these deals? Thanks for your help

Have a GREAT Thanksgiving.....you may already be gone......if so, lucky you!!!!

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

"Missing in action","Last night i could not sleep.  I really need to find my friend, just to remove him from system.  Last night I had a dream I found him.  The guy here at work called him for me.  He was not married, but had a daughter.  His feelings were mutual.  He had come to Chicago and rented a limo so that we could have an evening alone.  We did not have any sexual activity.  We did a lot of catching up and sharing of feelings.  He would send me flowers and he wanted to buy me an expensive gift, but i told him that was not necessary, but he did it anyway.  His last statement to me was that i let you get away before, but i will not from this day forward.

I wanted to ask the person who had the prohetic reading to take a look at both pictures (Frank, Ron) to see which man was the one in the dream.

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks

You are soooooooooooooo late.....(Smile)  Yes, I've seen Jewel, i tried to show her to you once before we were headed to the garage.  Yes, the looks great.  I asked her what was her secret and she said medical, plus a lot of prayer.  I just wanted to know what she took to lose it.  (Smile)

I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too.

And Fannette has been gone almost a year now.  (Smile)

She's also into Real Estate.

"Good Morning  :)","When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How was your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was there before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.  I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive a huge hug.  I love you.  Thanks for being there.

"RE: Job Information","You are soooooooooooooo late.....(Smile)  Yes, I've seen Jewel, i tried to show her to you once before we were headed to the garage.  Yes, the looks great.  I asked her what was her secret and she said medical, plus a lot of prayer.  I just wanted to know what she took to lose it.  (Smile)

I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too.

And Fannette has been gone almost a year now.  (Smile)

She's also into Real Estate.

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

There are some smaller subsids of larger companies previously assigned now listed. I pulled these subs in from the credit pre-approval list. I will be passing out draft contracts folders for these counterparties tomorrow to the people responsible for the respective parent companies.
There are some companies on your lists that do not have draft packets. These companies have NOT been pre-approved by credit, but credit is working on them now. Continue to call these customers regarding password applications, but do not promise that the ISDA documents, etc. are immediately forthcoming until we receive those worksheets from credit.
Please continue to pass on both the pa information and the draft packets as you receive the correct contact info. If you have any questions at all, please call me at 5-3614 or come by my desk at 06541 in the rotunda.

Thank you,

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5 hours
because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject is
he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating just
about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam, especially
to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell her

to.

Hey Lady,

I just asked ""Tarsha"" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.  I'm
very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little ""stinky"".

Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home, I'll
call you if I do, or just call her for you.

Talk with you later!!!

Hugs

   Hey Tricey!

   I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
   going
   on? How are the boys?

   Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
   yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

   Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday
   but
   she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
   Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to
   you.
   Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer
   at
   4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
   address I have one for her too?

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Please find attached spreadsheets showing the Top 50 gas customers and the Top 50 power customers, showing the internal rep for gas contact, power contact and PA contact.

As discussed in our meeting today, every Master User for each company should be contacted, unless it becomes known that a particular Master User is not responsible for either gas or power.

The person identified under the ""PA"" column beside a company will be responsible for calling the Master Users for that company. If all the Master Users have not been contacted within 2 days of the ""Green Light"" for PA marketing, the NetcoOnline marketing team will place the calls.

You will shortly receive a PA marketing pack. This pack will contain:

	a) Copies of PA's and ETA's, which you can fax to customers
	b) Frequently Asked Questions
	c) Key Messages

If you have any questions about the NetcoOnline process or the PA process, please contact the NetcoOnline marketing rep identified in the ""Netco"" column on the spreadsheet.

"Re: RE: Good Morning  :)","I appreciate all that you have done.  There are 7 days remaining.  I wish I
was leaving tomorrow.  I miss him dearly.  Three to four years is going to be
a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my daughters
would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let her
know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that is
not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not move
until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I would be
set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last night
and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the lady on
today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all goes
well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head up
about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with him
personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

>>> Patrice.L.Mims@enron.com 01/30 1:01 PM >>>
Hey ""G"",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the purse
and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this
afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.  It's
on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with me,
I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this
stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its
hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

Love ya

   mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this
   week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of

   before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I went
   in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo afraid/scared.
   I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I seem
   evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
   him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to receive

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Patrice,
Please see the below comments from my attorney.  Let me know if we can work
with this.
Thanks

I suggest revising that sentence as follows to avoid any potential conflict
within the terms of the Guaranty itself and to accommodate Enron's
reasonable request for a specific number of days:

     "" . . . and shall be deemed sufficient notice that, subject to
Paragraph 9 of this Guaranty, Guarantor agrees to pay the Obligations
within 7 business days after receiving the Payment Demand.""

Hey Rob,

We have one more comment for you to consider:

We must have a definitive number of days in case, ""Enron makes a demand on
this guaranty"".  We cannot leave the contract silent on that issue.  How
about making it 7 days instead of 5 days.  Our lawyers say that we must
have a definitive number of days.

Your turn!

   Rob,

   I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference
   to
   ""must pay within 5 business days"" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does
   make
   a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
   those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party
   to
   provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand
   under
   a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments
   where
   appropriate.

   I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

   I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
   authority.

   Finally, I reinserted ""excluding choice of law provisions . . . ""
   language
   to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

   All told, most of the changes look fine.

   Thanks.

   Ernie

"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

   >>Rudy often came with me and almost every time he'd pretend to go

   >>
   >>I knew what he was up to.  I'd always spot him walking down the
   >>aisle with the three yellow roses in his hands.  Rudy knew I loved
   yellow
   >>roses.  With a heart filled with grief, I only wanted to buy my few
   >>items and leave, but even grocery shopping was different since Rudy
   >>had  passed on.  Shopping for one took time, a little more thought
   than
   >>it
   >>had for two.
   >>
   >>Standing by the meat, I searched for the perfect small steak and
   >>remembered how Rudy had loved his steak.
   >>
   >>Suddenly a woman came beside me.  She was blond, slim and lovely in
   >>a soft green pantsuit.  I watched as she picked up a large pack of
   >>T-bones, dropped them  in her basket, hesitated, and then put them
   back.
   >>She
   >>turned to go and once again reached for the pack of steaks.
   >>
   >>She saw me watching her and she smiled.  ""My husband loves T-bones,
   >>but honestly, at these prices, I don't know.""
   >>I swallowed the emotion down my throat and met her pale blue eyes.
   >>""My  husband passed away eight days ago,"" I told her.  Glancing at
the
   >>package in her hands, I fought to control the tremble in my voice.
   >>""Buy him the steaks.  And cherish every moment you have together.""
   >>
   >>She shook her head and I saw the emotion in her eyes as she placed
   >>the package in her basket and wheeled away.
   >>
   >>I turned and pushed my cart across the length of the store to the
   >>dairy products.  There I stood, trying to decide which size milk I
   should
   >>buy.  A quart, I finally decided and moved on to the ice cream
   >>section near the front of the store.  If nothing else, I could
   >>always fix myself an ice cream cone.  I placed the ice cream in my
   cart
   >>and looked down the aisle toward the front.
   >>
   >>I saw first the green suit, then recognized the pretty lady coming
   >>towards me.  In her arms she carried a package.
   >>On her face was the brightest smile I had ever seen.  I
   >>would swear a soft halo encircled her blond hair as she kept
   >>walking toward me, her eyes holding mine.  As she came closer, I saw
   what
   >>she held and tears began misting in my eyes.
   >>""These are for you,"" she said and placed three beautiful long
   >>stemmed yellow roses in my arms.  ""When you go through the line, they
   >>will
   >>know these are paid for."" She leaned over and placed a gentle kiss on
   my
   >>cheek, then
   >>smiled again.
   >>
   >>I wanted to tell her what she'd done, what the roses meant, but
   >>still unable to speak, I watched as she walked away as tears clouded
   my
   >>vision.  I looked down at the beautiful roses nestled in the green
   >>tissue wrapping and found it almost unreal.  How did she know?
   >>Suddenly  the answer seemed so clear.  I wasn't alone.
   >>""Oh, Rudy, you haven't forgotten me, have you?  I whispered, with
   >>tears in my eyes.  He was still with me, and she was his angel.
   >>

"FW: Nicor Hub contracts","It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.


Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.


  


These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.


We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  


If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

Let me know how the test goes.

Thanks,

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know.

Subject:	Nicor Hub contracts

We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,

"Heartland Steel Invoice","Hi Patrice,

I left you a voice mail earlier, but I wanted to send a spreadsheet so you can see what I'm looking at. 

Have the buyback prices been changed in Sitara? 
Which months are you going to change?
Is CSN going to be a prepay? If so, then I will add the Nov prepay to the invoice.

Please take a look at the invoice and let me know if you think this is what they're looking for.

By the way, I never got a chance to really thank you for bringing me along on the trip. I truly appreciate the learning experience and the chance to see firsthand how you interact with our clients. And it wouldn't have been quite as enjoyable with just anybody---you were great company! 

Thanks!

 Regarding the GISB,  issues remaining are Section 3.2 Performance Obl. and their Guaranty.

We prefer Spot Standard for Section 3.2 however, they argue the Cilco city gate does not have a ""Spot Market"" .  If the city gate is their end user I will give on this point.  Tammy is checking on this.  The only other issue is their Guaranty to Enron.  I have no problem with amending the gty or putting a new one in place.  Having said that, I would prefer they draft the amendment.  This of course is contingent on credits ok with the change in the gty amount.

FYI, I will be out to the office tomorrow afternoon for meetings. If you need me leave a message with my assistant and I will call you back.

Jason,

There is a net receivable of about $75,000. Do I remember you saying yesterday that your mark-to-market exposure calculation is including the contract termination fee or not? Chuck Jacobs was given this $890,930 number. It was included in the Jan invoice, but HS did not pay it. This fee was never entered in Sitara and Unify never generated an invoice for it. So, we won't see that as an outstanding receivable in SAP. Does this number get included? Please see my attachment and call if you need anything else. One more issue, there is approximately $92,177.09 (11,319.01 on sale side & $80,858.08 on the purchase side) that we owe them for vol adjustments on MGT following Jan 24. My thought is that this number should be included during negotiations on a final number. Do you want backup (pipe support) showing this credit is in fact valid? 

 

Thanks,
Valerie

John, Valerie and Lisa -

I have run the calculations on Heartland Steel's mark-to-market exposure as of close of business on January 24, 2001.  The figure I have calculated is $1,078,209.

Please note that this number does not represent the entire termination payment.  We also need to include the net payable/receivable as of COB 1/24/01 to determine the complete termination payment.  I recall that we had a net receivable from Heartland, but I do not recall the amount.  It should have been somewhere in the neighborhood of $700,000 ( ~$305,000 for December gas and ~$395,000 for January gas to that point).  Valerie, can you pull records to indicate what the receivable was on that date?

Please call me if you have any questions.

"Heartland Steel---CSN","Hey Guys,


I do not feel that the Heartland Steel/CSN issue is resolved.  We are now getting calls from a representative of CSN (Companhia Sidergica Nacional, LLC) saying that they have purchased Heartland Steel effective July, 2001.  If this is the case, then why are we continuing to invoice Heartland Steel?  Have we been paid by Heartland Steel?  Have we been continuing to receive the prepayments, and if so from whom?  Has CSN assumed the contractual obligations of Heartland Steel?

While the credit risk is not my responsibility, I am, however, extremely concerned that we really do not have a firm handle on the identity of our actual counterparty.

Will you please let me know how we should proceed.  I have a call into the CSN representative and it appears that they are not really happy with us, and would like to receive a visit from an Enron representative.

Let me know what the game plan is by noon, Friday, September 28, 2001.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster

+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter

   Hey girl!  Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  I was in
   bed by 9:30.  Steve got home around 11:00 and didn't say a word to me.
   He
   turned on lights and made lots of noise, but said nothing.  He slept
   upstairs in the game room last night, so evidentally, he goes in late
   today.  He could've at least dressed and taken the kids to school, since
   I
   do it every morning, but he didn't.  I can't worry about it.  I'm so use
   to
   doing it all by myself anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  What time
   will
   you be at rehearsal tonight?  Maybe we can talk before then.

   Hope's number is (713) 207-7103.   Talk to you later!

   Hey good morning,

   How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to
   Lane
   Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What
   is
   Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it
   better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.

      Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
      cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be
      homework.
      They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this
   morning.
      I
      promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I

      Tasha,

      I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I
   definitely
      know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without
   the
      kids
      for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you
      and
      talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
      tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

         Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I
      really
         don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He
      has
         threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time,
   I'm
         scared.
         I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc...
   so
      bad,
         and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right
   thing
      to
         do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if
   he
         chooses
         not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial
      difficulties.
         This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I
      don't
         know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with
   him
      has
         done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what
   more
      he
         could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the
   kids
      and
         what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things
   that
      I
         do
         to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

Girl, that's my dilemma as far as a house is concerned.  I have no idea,
all I know is that I don't want to drive for an hour to get to work.  I
really wish I could tear down and rebuild where I am.  I love the ""hood""
aspect of the neighborhood, I love the ""colored"" folks, and so on.  I need
to talk to a loan officer and see exactly what I would qualify for.  All I
know, is that I'm not getting any younger, and why not enjoy a new house
now, what am I waiting for?

Girl, I hope the plumbing isn't too expensive as well, but it has to be
done!

Jordan's old silly teacher called me at work this morning around 8:30 a.m.
When I answered the phone, I recognized her voice immediately, and I got
scared that something had happened.  That heifer called to tell me that
Jordan was telling her that I had given him money to buy a Fruitopia soft
drink (first of all, it took me questioning her three times to find out
what the heck Fruitopia meant)  and she wanted to check with me to see if
that were true, because she didn't allow that particular drink in her class
because it had too much sugar in it......well, I was pissed number one,
that you would even call and upset me at work by asking me such a dumb ass
question.  You are the adult here, not Jordan!  She also said Jordan kind
of smarted off to her.....well, take control sister.....you obviously have
no control if you have to call me on my job to settle an insignificant
matter such as this.  ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS!!!!!!

Now on the other hand, Jordan will have to be punished for lying, but my
goodness, can you believe it?

   Hey girl!!  When I opened up this e-mail I said, ""Wow""!!  It has to be
   EXTREMELY SLOW to get an e-mail like this!!  Girl you are so-oo crazy.
   Sounds like you were a true FOX last night.  Thank goodness you weren't
   in
   Chicago, looking like that!!  The outfit sounds cute.  Doesn't it make
   you
   feel good when the kids admire you.  I can relate to that warm, fuzzy
   feeling brought on by your child.  I can't wait to see the pictures.

   I'm sorry to hear that you're having plumbing problems.  Did Todd call a
   plumber last night?  I wonder how expensive that job will be?

   I'm looking forward to rehearsal also.  Where was V. Michael on Sunday?
   I
   was wondering where Samantha had been myself.  I heard that she sang
   with
   the women 5th Sunday.  I was thinking she had gone over to Higher
   Dimensions with Sis. Kaye.  We need to visit that church and see what
   all
   the hupla is.  Do you have a hat for next Sunday?

   After church, I went home & cooked spaghetti.  Steve's cousin was giving
   a
   small family b-day gathering for his mom.  I didn't want to go, but
   Steve
   asked me to.  On the way home, he wanted to talk.  He told me how much
   he
   loved me, etc...  Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  It all sounded so familiar.  He
   also
   apologized for the big blow up on Saturday.  He even apologized to Siera
   for the things she heard.  She told him that she didn't like the way he
   treated her mom.  She really expressed herself.  I was proud of her for
   speaking up.  She was very respectful, but got her point across.  I felt
   like he was only trying to make peace because he wanted some you know
   what.
   He wasn't getting off that easy.  When we got in bed, he wanted to
   snuggle
   up under me.  I then asked him where he had gone the other night.  He
   immediately got an attitude.  I asked again and he yelled, ""Why""!  He
   then
   jumped out of the bed saying something about me questioning him as if
   he's
   6 yrs. old.  I said, ""Whatever, you've just confirmed what I feel so
   just
   go on & get out of here.""  He's so-oo stupid!  I'm his wife and can't
   ask
   where he's been.  I should know where he is at all times.  I just really
   don't have time for his mess.

   So, in what area would you like to purchase a new house?  Write back.

   Hey girl,

   What's going on?  It is truly a slow day over here.  So far, I really
   could
   have taken the day off and would not have missed anything.  Last night I
   had a date with my mother-in-law.  She's a member of a book club and
   they
   had their 3rd annual literary Gala last night at the Omni Hotel.  It was
   nice, but long.  The tickets said it started at 6:00 and I got their at
   6:00.  The doggone ticket should have said cocktails at 6:00 and seating
   at
   6:45.  I was tired of standing around waiting to be seated.  But, girl,
   Ms
   Thang felt so good last night.  I felt like a million dollars in my
   semi-formal attire.  After I left church, I went to one of my favorite
   stores, Chico's, and bought myself a nice dressy top to go with my floor
   length (not by design, I'm just not tall enough) black skirt.  The top
   that
   I bought set it off so nicely.  It was black, light brown and gold!  I
   wore
   my rhinestone choker and my rhinestone big hoop earrings, not the ones I
   wear all the time, but a new pair, much mo' flashy and my black high
   heel
   sandals that show all my foot.  Boy, I felt good about my appearance.
   When
   I came out of the bedroom after getting dressed, Jordan said
   ""Mommy.......you look pretty.  Made my evening.  Of course, Bozo the
   husband, didn't say one word.  But I felt good, I even had Jordan take
   some
   pictures of me, so we'll see how those come out (smile).

   We have severe plumbng problems I discovered when I got back home, Todd
   said the septic tank is stopped up, I have no idea what that really
   entails, but it must of been ugly.  He was pissed!

   Looking forward to rehearsal tomorrow night, speaking of rehearsal, I
   was
   wondering where Samantha had been, and Poiter told me yesterday that
   she's
   back in school, so that's why she's hasn't been there.

   How did your evening go last night?  We still need to talk, maybe we'll
   get
   a chance to visit tonight.  Todd already said he wasn't going to be home
   until around 11:00 p.m. on Mon, Tues, or Wed, of this week, due to Power
   Mart.  I said fine, have fun.  I am so bitter, I'm ready for a change
   too.
   Right now, it doesn't seem like me and the boys would be missing much.
   All
   we do is coordinate our schedules to see when we can schedule different,
   independent, activities.  Plus, I'm ready for a new house, clean break
   and
   new environment.

   Oh well, talk with you later!

   Thanking you in advance for disregarding any and all typos!

      Hi Tricey!!  How is your day going so far?  Fine, I hope.  I've been
      extremely busy.  I'm glad it's Friday.  Well, Siera received her
   report
      card yesterday and it's not good.  I've almost cried myself into
      sickness.
      I don't know what else to do.  I've prayed and given it to God, but
   she
      still struggles.  We're seeking some outside tutoring right now.  The
      4th
      grade teacher at Southwest is going to tutor her.  Keep her lifted up
   in
      prayer.  She's pretty much given up completely.  She thinks that
   she's
      dumb
      and that she'll be placed in special education.  She wrote me a
   letter
      last
      night telling me to stop telling her that she's smart, because she's
      not.
      She said that she's dumb because her report card says so.  That hurt
   me
      so
      bad.

      Lil' Steve's report card was excellent.  He's doing a great job.  The
      best
      thing we could've done for him was put him at Southwest.

      How's the school search going for Jordan?

STRONG BUY
Target Price: 54.00 (US$)
Dynegy Inc. (DYN)
ENE Deal Shows Risk Coverage & Est & Valuation Upside

Summary

After the close on Friday, DYN confirmed that it would acquire Enron (ENE, 8.63,
Strong Buy) for 0.2685 DYN shares plus assumption of debt and an equity infusion
of $2.5 billion. This values ENE at $10.40 per share based on DYN's Friday
close.

Our initial analyses show the merger to be additive to pro-forma '02 eps for DYN
by 25% to $3.25-$3.30 vs our current estimate of $2.55. We estimate the deal
multiples as about 7x '02 eps, 3.2x '02 cash flow, 0.85x book value and 5x
EV/EBITDA based on our revised '02 estimates for ENE.

We would note that DYN has projected a pro-forma '02 of $3.40-$3.50 per share
before cost savings and synergies.

We expect the deal to close in 9-12 months pending reviews by the SEC, FTC, FERC
and state PSCs. Despite the size of the combined company, we do not expect major
divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and
the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.

In a report dated Nov 5, we valued ENE at $31 per share. In our view, the deal
valuation includes a differential of $20 per share or $17 billion to account for
ENEs related party and accounting issues. Because these issues threatened ENEs
core businesses, the timing and valuation of the deal for DYN is extraordinarily
attractive. We consider alternate bids for ENE to be possible under these
circumstances.

We expect DYN and other energy merchants to benefit from the removal of risk
that ENE would be downgraded below investment grade or file for bankruptcy
protection.

Pending additional information from conference calls, analyst meetings and other
deal related filings; we are maintaining our reported eps ests for DYN of $2.10
for '01 and $2.55 for '02. Our ENE ests are $1.80 for '01 and $1.60 for '02.
These estimates assume the deal closes in 4Q'02.

"Online Launch Plan Update","With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Subject:	Online Launch Plan Update

With the filing of the Hart-Scott-Rodino application last week, it looks like our updated launch timeline is as follows. Note that it is still possible that this timeline could shift:

Week of Jan 28:

We will distribute a packet to each of the Originators/Traders who have volounteered to call customers and assist in getting signed Password Applications. The packets will contain:

Key Messages
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Top Counterparty Checklist 
External Customer Cover Letter
Password Application (PA)
Registration Form
Fax Cover Sheet for PA/Registration 
Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA)
Internal online Marketing Contact List

Each person receiving a pack will contact the Master Users at the companies they have volounteered for and send them copies of the Password Application (PA) and Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA). During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have a signed PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch the new site.

A Splash page will be available at www.UBSWenergy.com or via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of www.UBSWenergy.com and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub Users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


Week of Feb. 4:

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for the site. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

Week of Feb. 11:

The site will launch, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues). 

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

The Top 50 customers will have at least an initial contact within the first two days of starting the marketing effort and that all customers who previously traded either gas or power will receive a mailing within the first 10 days. An online marketer has been assigned as coordinator for each company and will assist each Trader/Originator in following up with Master Users as necessary to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


UBSWenergy Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power

"RE: Hi","
I love Clinique. I haven't tried their mascara but I've been using their
powder for about 3 years.

She is registered under Danielle Crusoe. Victoria doesn't have a registry
but when we went the manager let me write down all of the things that
Danielle wanted and she said that she would make sure that everyone in her
store knew about it for when people came in. I called it ""Danielle Crusoe's
Wish List"". I must give you the invitation. Her theme is ""Around the
Clock"". Have you been to this kind of shower before? It wear you bring a
gift that the bride-to-be will use during the morning, midday or evening
hours. I absolutely love during bridal showers they're so fun.

Clinique, it's there new one.  But is she registered under Danielle Crusoe?
They do have a registry, correct.  I'm kinda excited to know what Danielle
is registered for?

   Hey noonie!

   I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
   invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her
   about
   it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
   places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might
   have
   to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there
   with
   something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I
   have
   all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

   What is your favorite mascara?

   Hope,

   I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the
   Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her
   then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle
   registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church
   tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she
   registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for
   myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my
   favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

   Hugs

      Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5

      I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please
   tell
      her
      or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address
   because
      she
      had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a

      to.

      Hey Lady,

      I just asked ""Tarsha"" about you the other day.  I hear you two have
   been
      shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
      Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are
   doing
      great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.
      I'm
      very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little ""stinky"".

      Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home,
      I'll
      call you if I do, or just call her for you.

      Talk with you later!!!

      Hugs

         I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has
   been
         going
         on? How are the boys?

         Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with
   Taylor
         yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

         Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on
      Tuesday
         but
         she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't
   either.
         Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give
   it
      to
         you.
         Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on
      Westheimer
         at
         4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or
   email
         address I have one for her too?

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.

"RE: Your dress :o)","
I know that it's in the IT department and that's it :o)

Everything is going okay, thanks so much for asking. It is definitely a lot
of work, one thing after another. I'm glad to know that Jordan is excited
:o).

We love going to good 'ole' Chuckie, you see I said we because I LOVE their
pizza. The children really have a good time there too plus it wears them
out!

I ain't mad at the little boys Kenneth Coles because I sure do love their
shoes..... ha! I know that moma Thurston don't play that nonsense when it
comes down to service. People are just getting besides themselves these
days. I almost went off in Olive Garden yesterday because of poor
management service but my girlfriend didn't want me too. I am so mad at for
wanting to SET IT OFF, you are too kicks (Louisiana talk o:))

My weekend was okay. I picked up some cake tasters that this one bakery we
have in mind baked for us. They gave us 4 samples, I chose Italian Creme,
Carrot Cake, Amoretto White and Mark chose a Chocolate Fudge and they were
good except for I don't eat chocolate cake. I pick up another sample cake
on tomorrow and then one more probably this weekend. Saturday I was with
Danny most of the day and that was it.

Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit
the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all
of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a
wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with
Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to
the dreaded ""Chuckee Cheese"" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to
get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was
there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute,
fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they
were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.
$65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what
the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither
one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a
pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed
and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost ""set if off"" at the
Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was
unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

How was your weekend?

See ya!

You're too sweet. I'm doing the best that I can with God's grace!

Easter really sneaked up on me too fast. I wanted to take the kids to take
pictures and everything but I just haven't had a chance to. I haven't even
bought an Easter basket :o)
Are you all doing anything special on Sunday?

"Re: Crestar","Thanks for the update.


From:	Patrice L Mims/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/14/2001 07:39 AM
To:	Scott Dozier/NA/Enron@Enron
cc:	 

Subject:	Crestar

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks

"Enron Naturl Gas","Regarding our conversation on September 27 and 28, 2001, I am requesting
that a representative from Enron get in touch with us on Monday, October 1,
2001.

Presently, CSN, LLC and Enron do not have a natural gas contract in place.
CSN was billed and paid on Enron's August invoice #200108-01M for 46,500
mmbtu under the Heartland Steel, Inc. contract.  Our actual consumption for
August was 16,290 mmbtu.  CSN requests that the difference between what was
paid on the August invoice for 46,500 and the actual consumption of 16,290
mmbtu (30,210 mmbtu) be reimbursed to CSN.

CSN is being billed under the Heartland Steel, Inc. contract which is
incorrect.  For September's invoice from Enron, CSN should be billed for
their actual consumption, and pricing should be the average market price for
natural gas agreed between the parties.

Please be prepared to advise on the above on our Monday conversation.

Thanking you in advance.

"Aux Sable Contract","Patrice
Thanks for the call the other day. Here is a copy of our contract. It is
written with Aux Sable as an end-user in mind and therefore differs from the
typical pipe-to-pipe contract.
 <<ASLP Master Inlet Gas Purchase Agreement.doc>>
You can give me a call at 403-508-5852 if you have any questions.

If you have any questions on credit you can have your people contact me or
Gerry O'Connor, our VP of Finance. Gerry has been talking to Jennifer
Shipohs (I may have the spelling wrong) of your Industrial group, about
financial instruments and credit.

Another name and number you should have is Bob Lee, who is our short term
(30 days or less) trader. Bob's number is (403) 508-5851. I look after
longer term arrangements (30 days or more) and back-up Bob when he is away.

Derek Ashing
PS for Aux Sable - Patrice is the Enron physical trader for Chicago. Bob, if
you have any questions about what is being posted on Enron Online for
Chicago, this is the person to talk to. Patrice's number is 713-853-5772

Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be homework.
They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.  I

Tasha,

I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the kids
for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you and
talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

   Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I really
   don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He has
   threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
   scared.
   I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so bad,
   and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing to
   do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
   chooses
   not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial difficulties.
   This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I don't
   know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him has
   done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more he
   could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids and
   what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that I
   do
   to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

   Nytasha

Subject:	NetcoOnline Launch Plans


We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

Also, please see Louise's additions at the bottom of the list (from Adams Resources Marketing downward) and let me know if you have good relationships with any of these counterparties and could please take responsibility for them. Otherwise, our marketing team will be contacting these customers.
Finally, please note that even though there may be names for a specific counterparty in both the gas and the power columns, the person ultimately responsible for contacting that customer regarding the password application and registration forms is the person in the PA column on the far right.
Please remember when you are speaking to your customers to get all contact info possibly including contact name, phone and fax, e-mail, and address and send all this to Mary Griff Gray so that she can send them the PA and registration forms.

"RE: Hello","
Hey girl!  Sorry it took so long for me to reply.  I'm extremely busy over
here.  I'm trying to juggle my current work load and provide the auditors
with information they're requesting.

Hmm!  A vacation sounds great!!!  We're talking about going to Michigan
during the kids spring break. (March 11 - 15)  My aunt lives there.

Well, we decided to keep the truck for about 5 more months.  The 2003
Expeditions should be coming out then.  We'll also be buying a new car in
June or July.  I would love to have a Lexus, but the price doesn't agree
with my budget.  I'm now considering the 2002 Nissan Altima.  It has the
body style similiar to a Lexus GS300.  I hate car shopping because of the
sly salesmen, but I'll do my homework beforehand.

What's new with you?  How's your mom, sister and brothers doing?

Fine, I was thinking of you earlier today.  Just had a bite to eat and just
sitting here surfing the net.  Looking for some good vacation spots.   just
happened to be looking at Arizona for the heck of it.

How is you day going so far?  Already had lunch?  How did the car shopping
trip go on Saturday?

"Crestar/ BP","Patrice:
Just wanted to keep you in the loop...I talked to Crestar and BP Canada on a conference call today and we have made a game plan for dealing with the AOS daily volume changes.   I understand that BP and Crestar have entered an agreement which Enron will be purchasing up to 20,000 daily.  Up to 12,000 will be coming from BP and up to 8,000 purchased from Crestar on a daily basis.   I assume there will be two separate tickets in the event there are cuts that need to be accounted for on either counterparty.  
We have agreed to receive the volume of AOS from Gerry at Crestar by 10:00am Houston time every day and return to either both counterparties via Email or at least to BP the delivery point and the downstream contract for the AOS portion of the purchase from BP by 11:00 Houston time.   I have told them both for the sake of simplifying things the default delivery will be ANR/Alliance for baseload contract (assuming we have one, and assuming the volume works).    If you have any questions please let me know.
Thanks,
Mark

                                         Subject:     Fw: Questions






You don't have to answer the questions:


1.      Name the five wealthiest people in the world.

2.      Name the last five Heisman trophy winners.

3.      Name the last five winners of the Miss America contest.

4.      Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer prize.

5.      Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and
actress.

6.      Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners.


How did you do?

The point is, none of us remember the head liners of yesterday. These are
no second-rate achievers. They are the best in their fields.


But the applause dies. Achievements are forgotten.

Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners.


Here's another quiz.  See how you do on this one:

1.      List a few teachers who aided your journey through school.

2.      Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time.

3.      Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile.

4.      Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and
special.

5.      Think of five people you enjoy spending time with.

6.      Name half a dozen heroes whose stories have inspired you.


Easier?

The lesson:

The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the
most
credentials, the most money, or the most awards.  They are the ones who
care.


Pass this on to those people who have made a difference in your life.


""Don't worry about the world coming to an end today. It's already tomorrow
in
Australia.""

"RE: Steve","
Hey girl!  Sorry I didn't get a chance to call you last night.  I was in
bed by 9:30.  Steve got home around 11:00 and didn't say a word to me.  He
turned on lights and made lots of noise, but said nothing.  He slept
upstairs in the game room last night, so evidentally, he goes in late
today.  He could've at least dressed and taken the kids to school, since I
do it every morning, but he didn't.  I can't worry about it.  I'm so use to
doing it all by myself anyway, so it really doesn't matter.  What time will
you be at rehearsal tonight?  Maybe we can talk before then.

Hope's number is (713) 207-7103.   Talk to you later!

Hey good morning,

How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane
Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is
Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it
better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.

   Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
   cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be
   homework.
   They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.
   I
   promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I

   Tasha,

   I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
   know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the
   kids
   for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you
   and
   talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
   tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!

      Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I
   really
      don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He
   has
      threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
      scared.
      I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so
   bad,
      and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing
   to
      do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
      chooses
      not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial
   difficulties.
      This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I
   don't
      know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him
   has
      done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more
   he
      could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids
   and
      what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that
   I
      do
      to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.

"Your dress :o)","Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress but
the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a girl
and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question :o)
Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to walk
with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with the
biggest smile on her face.

Love ya!

"Hi","
Hey Tricey!

I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been going
on? How are the boys?

Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on Tuesday but
she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it to you.
Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on Westheimer at
4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
address I have one for her too?

$110. If purchased by October 31st, you will get 15% off.

I really hope that Jordan will want to do it :o)

Here is one picture of the bridesmaids dress. I am using two different
tops. Some of the girls will wear the one below and the other girls will
wear a strapless top. The color of them all are Rosebud. My sister will
wear a Rosebud lace outfit. They don't have a picture on the web of the
strapless top or my sister's dress but I can show it to you in a book. The
girls who are wearing the strapless top will also wear the same straight
skirt that is pictured. I am also attaching a picture of my mommy's dress.

Hope, Hope, Hope,

The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go
to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is
that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the
dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about
the cost, I just want to look good!)

What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will
be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain
everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as
well.  That boy is a mess!

Talk to you soon!


P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!

   Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!

   You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress
   but
   the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
   tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)

   Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a
   girl
   and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question
   :o)
   Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
   talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to
   walk
   with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with
   the
   biggest smile on her face.

   Love ya!

Hi Patrice,

I know it's never going to be a good time to take care of this deal, but we've got to do it sometime. Let me know what time is good for you. Please let me know the payment terms of the new deal, so that I can get with the new coordinator of this account. More specifically, are they still prepaying??? Since the name changed to ""c,"" I will no longer be handling it. Bummer, huh? 

Thanks!

"Heartland Steel","Patrice--I'm working on the reconciliation and I've noticed that in Sitara for deal 1084719, the pricing is at Citygate GD for day 16. Did you go back in and change this? Let me know b/c the pricing is coming across in Unify as $2.29 rather than the $2.22833 you put in for the rest of the month.

I'll send you the spreadsheet as soon as it's done......

Hey noonie!

I am going to try to make it to revival as well so I'll bring your
invitation. I have one for Robin too. Tasha told me that she told her about
it but she didn't say whether she was coming or not. Those are the two
places where she is registered. You are a mess talking about you might have
to pick something up for yourself. It is hard not to come out of there with
something for yourself and I'm sure Todd wouldn't be mad at cha' :o) I have
all the games ready for the shower, I sure hope everyone enjoys them.

What is your favorite mascara?

Hope,

I did not have Sheree's telephone number after all.  I am going to the
Revival tonight, so hopefully, she will be there and I will talk to her
then.  Did anyone invite Robin to the shower?  Also, where is Danielle
registered?  I need to do my shopping hopefully, before I go to church
tonight.  I think Tasha mentioned Vicky's Secret and Target.  Is she
registered at Vicky's Secret?  I might have to pick up something for
myself.  Let me know, b/c I have to stop by the mall anyway to get my
favorite mascara, and I just as soon go there at the same time.

Hugs

   Yes we were out shopping today at Arne's. Tasha had me gone for 2.5
   hours
   because we stopped at Benihana's! I'm so proud of Jordan. What subject
   is
   he enjoying the most? Taylor loves reading. DeMya has been repeating
   just
   about every word that you say. Tricey why does she say no mam,
   especially
   to Taylor. I guess I say that too much :o).

   I do mean Sheree, that's a cute spelling of her name. Yes, please tell
   her
   or like you said call me. Danielle was going to get her address because
   she
   had her name down for someone she wanted to invite but didn't get a
   chance
   to.

   Smooches

   Hey Lady,

   I just asked ""Tarsha"" about you the other day.  I hear you two have been
   shopping for decorations, etc. for the shower.  I will be there on
   Saturday, looking forward to it.  How are the girls, the boys are doing
   great.  Jordan just got his first report card, and it was very good.
   I'm
   very proud of him, and Kendall is just Kendall, my little ""stinky"".

   Who is Sherie or do you mean Sheree?  I may have her number at home,
   I'll
   call you if I do, or just call her for you.

   Talk with you later!!!

   Hugs

      Hey Tricey!

      I haven't talked to you or seen you in a little while. What has been
      going
      on? How are the boys?

      Not too much is going on with me. I went on a field trip with Taylor
      yesterday to the Oil Ranch (pumpkin patch) and we had a good time.

      Danielle was going to give you your invitation to her shower on
   Tuesday
      but
      she didn't know that we weren't having rehearsal and I didn't either.
      Needless to say, I have your invitation and I would like to give it
   to
      you.
      Do you think that you are coming? It's at the Pappadeaux on
   Westheimer
      at
      4PM. By the way, do you by chance have Sherie's phone number or email
      address I have one for her too?

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"Re: Hey","Wow, I am really sorry to hear about your Dad!  I know how close you two
were/are.  I am so glad you know he is in a better place....its just hard
when you miss someone so much.

I am so so glad to hear you are loving you job!  A great boss makes all the
difference ...you were a great boss so its only fair you get one too.  I
really loved Middle Marketing, it was the most creative and challenging job
around and it has a lot of fringe benefits (boone-doggles, etc).  I have
heard Laura Luce's name quite a bit but I never heard anything personal
about her so I am glad to hear she is nice and smart!

It surprises me a little bit to hear that Jordan broke his arm, I would
expect that it would have been Kendall since he sounds so gregarious and
outgoing.  I bet it broke your heart to see that!  Ouch!  I am sorry to hear
about Suzy financial situation, I can really relate since I recently took a
big hit to my retirement fund and (including Enron Options/stock).  Its
kinda strange how much security money can give you.  Luckily I have been
able to keep it in perspective but it has been alittle bit of a ride.

Your house will feel new with new paint.  New paint just makes everything
new.  We also just finished a kitchen remodel and I love it.  I brought out
the big guns and got granite countertops.  We also put in recessed lighting
(instead of florescent), new crown and base molding, new tile, paint and I
added bead-board to my island so that it looks more like a separate piece of
furniture.  It looks good.

Thanks for the heads up on Julie.  I had lunch last week with Greg McClendon
and told me too.

LUNCH, HOW ABOUT FEBRUARY 4TH?  I know that seems like a long time away but
since the MDO program follows the school year, they are always out!  Alex
and Conner go to school on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 to 2.

Talk to ya soon,

Subject:	Crestar

Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks

"RE: Heartland Steel","We really have had nothing to do with this since it went into bankrupcty.  We were basically wiped out except for a very small portion of the senior debt.  We will get back about $500,000 of a $32.5 million.  We also lost money on the MTM of the gas contract and a little on the commodity piece.  

This thing was so bad that there was really nothing we could do to save it.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Dynegy Discussions","
Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

"Nicor Hub contracts","We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

"Enron/BP/Crestar Apr10 Conversation re AOS Gas","
---------------------- Forwarded by Mark L Schrab/HOU/ECT on 04/12/2001 10:01 AM ---------------------------


""Jim Pearson"" <Jim_Pearson@keyspancanada.com> on 04/11/2001 06:49:23 PM
To:	Mark.L.Schrab@enron.com, bartneea@bp.com
cc:	""Gerry Kurtz"" <Gerry_Kurtz@keyspancanada.com> 
Subject:	Enron/BP/Crestar Apr10 Conversation re AOS Gas


The following is a summary of our conversation on Tuesday, April 10  re
communication time lines:

8:55MCT
   By this deadline, Gerry Kurtz will phone Elizabeth Bartnes with the AOS
   volumes (if any) to be purchased and transported by BP to Enron.
   KeySpan will indicate the BP AOS decatherms to be sold to Enron, as well
   as the E3M3, GJ and delivery point for the Crestar gas to be sold to BP.

9:00MCT
   By this deadline, Gerry will phone Mark Schrab of Enron to advise him
   whether and how many decatherms of AOS will flow to Enron and how much
   will be provided by each of BP and Crestar.  The relative share of AOS
   gas to be provided by BP and Crestar will not necessarily be prorated
   according to their shares of the 51,100 Mcf Contract Capacity.
   At this time, Mark will likely have a good idea of the downstream
   volumes, contracts and pipelines applicable to at least the BP portion
   of the AOS supplied to Enron.  He will first respond to the offered BP
   AOS supply by providing the BP information (if available) verbally to
   Gerry, and will follow up by confirming to both Elisabeth and Gerry in
   an email/spreadsheet shortly after.
   It is understood that Enron is under no obligation to accept an AOS
   nomination if KeySpan misses the 9:00MCT deadline.

9:45MCT
   As described above, before this deadline Mark will have sent an email to
   both BP and Crestar detailing the destination(s) of the BP AOS sale to
   Enron.
   By this deadline, Mark will then send an email/spreadsheet to Gerry
   regarding the destination(s) of the Crestar Firm and AOS sales to Enron.
   It is understood that Enron will be responsible for any pipeline
   imbalance or other charges if Enron does not meet the 9:45MCT deadline.

10:30MCT
   By this deadline, both BP and Crestar will nominate their respective
   supply volumes to Alliance for delivery to Enron and its markets.
   BP or Crestar will be responsible for any charges which they may cause
   Enron to incur if they fail to nominate to Alliance by 10:30MCT.

If I have missed any details, please let me know.

Jim

"IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO ALL EMPLOYEES PARTICIPATING IN THE ENRON CORP SAVINGS & ESOP PLANS","
PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"Re: Crestar/BP","
Grant/Dan, both Gulf and BP agree with the language. Dan please insert the
clause in both contracts: Transaction #1 and #1a and then please forward
updated contracts.

Dan - does Enron need to sign the assignment again or acknowledge that the
existing assignment agreement will suffice? Either acknowledge by replying
to this e-mail or e-mail to state Enron need to sign the agreement again.

Kelvin - I believe the attachment below will be the final version for BP. I
would attach this document with BP's ""package"" to be sent to your US
signing authority.

I understand this is the last hurdle in making the assignment work, so lets
endeavor to have all the agreements signed by Tuesday afternoon so we can
start flowing AOS on Wednesday for Thursday's nomination cycle.

Thanks everyone,

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Subject:	FW: UBS Warburg Energy - First Priority Trading Agreements


The first group of trading contracts will go out to 77 companies for a total of 168 counterparties (most companies have multiple entities).  This group obviously does not include everyone, but we have most of our major relationships (and it is the official list that has been submitted to UBS for credit approval.)  

The general marketing plan is as follows:
- Contact all customers this week to tell them about UBS Warburg Energy
- Get contract/PA packages in front of First Priority counterparties this week
- Arrange meetings or follow-up calls as appropriate
- Dave Forster and the ubswenergy.com team will be sending out online PA packages to all parties later this week (so it is important to have contacted all customers)
- Once the initial wave of contracts is out and review/negotiations are uderway, we will submit a Second Priority list for credit approval

The attached file has all of the First Priority counterparties, along with names for gas, power, online, credit and legal.   Apologies for the imperfect information - it came from several different sources.  In addition, we have columns for describing the type of agreement and its status (not pursuing, incomplete, done).  Please complete and/or edit the attached and forward to either Debra Bailey or Lloyd Will.  If you think you should take the lead on a particular counterparty, call up the other person and work it out!  Progress on this effort will be reviewed during our twice-weekly calls.

Rob,

I have made a few changes and one correction.  I deleted the reference to
""must pay within 5 business days"" added to paragraph 3.  If Enron does make
a demand under this guaranty, there is no way we can make payment within
those 5 days (especially since we will need to rely on an outside party to
provide data to us).  As you know, however, when we receive a demand under
a guaranty, we move quickly to verify the request and make payments where
appropriate.

I completed the information in paragraph 4(a).

I deleted the second copy of the reps and warranties of corporate
authority.

Finally, I reinserted ""excluding choice of law provisions . . . "" language
to try to keep the case under Texas law, assuming a dispute ever arises.

All told, most of the changes look fine.

Thanks.

Ernie

Minntac Passes Two-Billion-Ton Milestone


MOUNTAIN IRON, Minn., Oct. 18 /PRNewswire/ -- The Minntac Mining Operations
of United States Steel LLC passed a major milestone recently when it mined
its two-billionth ton of material. The total includes nearly 1.3 billion
tons of crude ore and approximately 416 million tons of waste rock and 296
million tons of overburden.


Minntac became the nation's first iron ore mining operation to reach this
production landmark when one of the mine's 35-cubic-yard shovels loaded
rock onto a 240-ton production truck at 2:06 a.m., Saturday, October 6. The
load was then taken to the Minntac Coarse Crusher where it was ground into
gravel-sized chunks to be used in the taconite process.


``This symbolic milestone reflects the hard work, innovation and dedication
of thousands of Minntac employees over the past half century,'' said
Minntac General Manager Jim Swearingen. ``It also reflects U. S. Steel's
continuing commitments to the Minnesota Iron Range and Minntac, where the
company has invested more than $200 million during the past five years to
enhance our operations and make Minntac more competitive in terms of
product quality and efficiency.


``We mined our two-billionth ton 50 years after U. S. Steel broke ground
for the Pilotac mine, the forerunner of Minntac, and only 15 years after we
passed the one-billion-ton mark in May 1986. We're looking forward to
reaching the next billion-ton plateau.''


On October 2, 1967, Minntac began processing taconite into pellets used in
blast furnaces to make the molten iron used in making steel, including high
value grades for the automotive, appliance, construction and other
industries. When it first began making taconite pellets, Minntac had a
rated annual capacity of 4.5 million tons. U. S. Steel has since nearly
quadrupled that capacity and, to date, Minntac has processed a total of 374
million tons of taconite pellets.


U. S. Steel's Minntac iron ore operations at Mountain Iron employ
approximately 1,600 workers and produce about 16.4 million tons of taconite
pellets annually. Minntac, North America's largest taconite pellet
producer, covers nearly 40,000 acres, including a mine that stretches 12
miles along the Mesabi Range.

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

   I appreciate all that you have done.  There are 7 days remaining.  I
   wish I
   was leaving tomorrow.  I miss him dearly.  Three to four years is going
   to be
   a challenge.  In that time frame I must finish school and both of my
   daughters
   would have graduated from high school and 8th grade.  The apartment was
   bothering me on yesterday.  It was laid on my heart to call her and let
   her
   know everything up front.  She had to run a credit report, you know that
   is
   not good due to the circumstances.  I let her also know why I can not
   move
   until March 1.  Emotionally I wish I could move Feb.1.  Financially I
   would be
   set to move and start my new life of March 1.  I prayed about on last
   night
   and turned it over to JESUS and I am not to worry about it.  I see the
   lady on
   today.  My whole life will be on the move in the month of Feb.  If all
   goes
   well I should receive the package no later than Tuesday.  Keep your head
   up
   about the class.  If you need to pull Hunter to the side and work with
   him
   personally do that.  May be L can help?  Beside missing RC I am okay.

   >>> Patrice.L.Mims@enron.com 01/30 1:01 PM >>>
   Hey ""G"",  what's up?  I know you will be shocked, but I brought the
   purse
   and necklace into the office and will be sending them out this
   afternoon....so there!  How's it going this morning?

   I have been sitting in a class all morning that Hunter is teaching.
   It's
   on options and volatility.  Boy, that stuff does not sink in well with
   me,
   I find the class a real challenge.  I'm so uncomfortable in the class.
   Pray for me, because I need to get this stuff and be able to chart this
   stuff.  Everyone is real helpful though, but being put on the spot, its
   hard to come up with the answers quickly.  It's painful for me....whew!

   Talk with you later.......how many days left now?

   Love ya

      When this email reaches you I pray that you are fine and well.  How
   was
      your weekend?  When are you suppose to see the lawyer?  I spoke with
      mine over the phone on Sat. and will be seeing the other one on this
      week.  Frank and I have to write out the agreement between the two of
      us.  The lady call me about the apartment, the prospect that was
   there
      before I was did not get it.  She offered the apartment to me.  I
   went
      in there praying and I guess the Lord saw fit.  I am soo
   afraid/scared.
      I woke up this morning and told Frank that he hurt me and that if I
   seem
      evil I do not mean to be it is because I am hurt and angry.  I caught
      him crying in the basement.  Patrice, I wish my dad was alive to

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Online Trading Simulation","We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.

To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST). It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.

Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:

Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup
Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week

Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:

Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups:
Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators)
Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems

Traders and Originators:
Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products. Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation. Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties. Credit limits, etc. will be tested during the simulation.

Information Technology:
Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books
Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.


Next steps 

Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles. You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.


Summary

This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business. We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

"Re: Howday","Mimmsie,
I miss hearing your voice and your laugh!

It sounds like you have a new job, is that right?  What is it?   I'm so out
of the loop.  Any job that can make you happier will definitely benefit the
entire family.  I'm go glad you move on to something new, it takes a lot of
guts but that is something you were never short on.   And I don't even want
to talk about the stock price.  I keep telling myself that I won't need it
for several years and who knows where it will be in 15-20 years.

The boys like their new MDO program.  Kids just need some time with peers or
they go crazy and wild.  It sounds like Kendall is a little carbon Copy
(with the load voice and all).  We can only hope we get one more Mimmsie in
the world.  It must be so weird to have one child in ""Real School"".  My how
times have flown by.  I remember when we were two Childless gals out to
conquer the world......Motherhood is better!

Wow, Suzy is moving to NY.  I meant to call her but just never did.  I
thought I would be bored once I was a stay home mom but I feel very busy
just not stressed out.  Tell her I said hello and Good luck on her move.

Well, have a great day and let me know what your new job is!

Love ya,
J

How the heck are ya?  I have been thinking of  you alot lately.  I tried to guess your e:mail address a couple of times  over the last couple of months but there is just no guessing it.  I finally  had to call Laura Vuittonet.
 
Well, I'm having a great time home with the  kids.  I really thought I would be bored by now but I feel just a busy just  not as tired.  In fact, for the first time since I had my kids I feel very  rested and at peace.  It's fun being a kid and  running around Houston  when there isn't much traffic and it nice having the time to slow down the  pace.
 
The boys are in Mothers Day Out 2 times a week from  9:00 - 2:00 which really isn't much time at all.  I could use another day  of alone time.  On those days I am usually meeting with Enron or once in a  while I meet a friend for lunch.  Time really flies.

Hey Debra,

Here is the assigment letter that we talked about--the deals that they want to assign from Kaztex to Nicor Energy are the following:
V17258.1
V17337.1
V17515.1

They want these contracts assigned to Nicor effective October 1st.  From my perspective, is there anything else I need to do, other than change the name on our documents,once you have approved the assigment agreement.

"Crestar 9/01","Patrice:
I understand from Jerry at Crestar that you two have spoken and that we will be revising deals 599461 and 1022740 for Sept 2001 to keep the firm deal, 599461, whole.  Have you communicated this to Kirk Lenart in logistics so he can repath the deals?  I will be out of the office this afternoon, but will be back on Monday.   If a payment needs to be made, we can get it out on Tuesday.  We've only short paid $500.00.

Going forward, should we be keeping the firm deal whole and swinging on the AOS deal?  We've had some confusion in the past on how to handle these deals and I would like to be able to verify that we are accounting for them correctly.  I tried to find a copy of the contract, but have not come across one as of yet.
