Thank you for taking questions.

Attached is a presentation which I believe is worth $40M / year with very little capital investment.  With your permission, I'd like to arrange to see you for 15 minutes to present this new venture.  With due respect, Lou Pai has been the only person who has not thought these two products would be a natural progression for Enron.  

If you are willing to discuss further, I would ask Jay Lewis to also attend.

Thank you again,

"strategy+business enews Exclusive: How Insurers Will Win the Finance","Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from strategy+business.

This week: How Insurers Will Win the Finance Wars

New York, August 27, 2001 - The insurance industry is bracing for a tough fight against financial-services companies that are rapidly  adding insurance to their product offerings. According to the  fourth-annual Booz-Allen & Hamilton eInsurance survey, the Web will be a key battleground.

In mid 2000, the Booz-Allen survey, which analyzed 206 financial-services sites, found that the top 10 insurance sites attracted 5 million unique visitors per month - versus 10 million for brokerage sites and 18 million for bank sites. As a result, banks and brokerages that sell insurance are getting their marketing messages in front of customers far more often than insurance competitors.

How can insurance companies increase their visibility on the Web to attract and retain more customers? Booz-Allen & Hamilton's  eInsurance survey says more non-insurance products, alliances with financial partners, and useful tools to increase traffic can go a long way in helping insurers get back in the game.

"(URGENT for WTN NOMINEEES) Are you coming to the World Technology  Summit?","MEMO: 
TO: World Technology Network Nominees 
FROM: Neil Davison, Assistant to the Chairman (James P. Clark) & Membership 
Manager, The World Technology Network (WTN). 
RE: Update about the World Technology Summit & Awards, London, 1 &2 July 
held in association with Nasdaq, GlaxoSmithkline, Business Week, CNBC, & 
Nature 
________________________________________________________ 
With less than two weeks until the historic gathering of innovators known as 
the World Technology Summit (July 1st & 2nd), we wanted to make contact with 
all World Technology Award Nominees to let those who have not yet registered know that there is still time to do so and to update them on what is happening.  (NOTE: If you have already registered please disregard this e-mail.  You will have received a separate registered delegate e-mail). 
Registration can be completed online at: http://www.wtn.net/summit2001  
The Update: 
An absolutely extraordinary group of people will be participating in the 
Summit. Many of them are your fellow World Technology Network (WTN) members (primarily previous World Technology Award Nominators or Finalists/Winners spread out across the 23 various categories of the membership).  A second large group is made up of 2001 Award Nominators and Nominees. Another 
contingent is composed of individuals who have applied to attend through 
outreach efforts by various partner organisations (we have selected a few 
dozen from amongst hundreds of applicants).  And, finally, others are 
business leaders specially invited in particular by two of our partners, Nasdaq and 
Business Week. The potential for serendipity is enormous. 
Speakers include, among many others, Sir Richard Sykes (Chairman, 
GlaxoSmithkline): Paul Hogg (Editor, ""Materials Technology"" magazine); Andrew 
Bermingham (Managing Director, Montreux Energy Roundtables); Peter J. Denning 
(Co-Editor, ""Beyond Calculation: The Next 50 Years of Computing""); David 
Isenberg (leading telecommunications provocateur); and Dr. Aram Mika (Vice 
President, Lockheed Martin Advanced Technologies Center). Moderators for the 
Summit include Nigel Roberts, CNBC television anchor; Paul Maraviglia, 
Managing Director Europe, Business Week; Reinhart Helmke, Executive Director, 
United Nations Office of Project Services (UNOPS); and Dr. Philip Campbell, 
Editor, Nature. 
It is also worth mentioning that McKinsey & Co.'s, Richard N. Foster, 
co-author of one of the most talked-about and catalytic business books around 
these days, ""CREATIVE DESTRUCTION"", will also be delivering a keynote address on Monday morning, 2 July. 
NOTE: CNBC is particularly interested in interviewing leaders of public (or 
soon-to-be-public) companies while at the Summit, so if you are open to that 
possibility, please let us know as soon as possible. 
Remember that the Summit agenda can be accessed through the Summit web site http://www.wtn.net/Summit2001  as well as the online registration form. 
If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate for a moment 
to get in touch.

"TV News Clip","Jeff

At the end of last week, there was a very interesting TV news story on NBC
KRON Channel 4 in San Francisco.  You lead the story, which also includes
Governor Davis, President Bush.

What most catches my attention are the visuals and chant of the protestors
during the Enron segment.  The props and signs are very TV camera friendly.
For instance, there is a larger then life mask of you and a mockup of a
""paycheck"" to you from the people of California.  The chant rhymes with your
name.

From my perspective, this was no simple pie in the face.  This protest was
very organized and sophisticated.  I think it would be prudent to gain more
information about who was behind it and who was behind them.
I tried sending you the video file in mpeg format, but at 8,400k it was too
large to email.  To see the news clip, you may double click this link
http://www.sfgate.com/av/movies/2001/06/21/power_kronm.mpg.  After
downloading, the video will play on a computer that has ""Real Player.""

"Business-Wide Cost Saving Opportunities","
At Enron, we're good at a lot of things:  making markets, commoditizing products, managing risk, offering innovative energy solutions to customers - the list goes on and on.  However, one of the things we could do a lot better is watching our expenses.  We're all shareholders in this company, and we need to spend our company's dollars as wisely as we spend our own.

There are some simple, yet significant measures each of us can take to make sure we're careful with Enron's money.  The Policy Committee has approved and recommended the following:

?	Professional Services - This is our largest area of discretionary spending, at more than $600 million last year. ""Professional Services"" includes our contracts with outside law and accounting firms, contractors and other consulting groups.  To make sure that we are negotiating the best rates and terms of service for the company across business units, we are requiring all future professional service contracts and those up for renewal to be negotiated through or in consultation with Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), effective July 1.  In addition, contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by the business unit senior executive or their designee and GSS.  For more information, see http://ibuyit.enron.com.

?	On-line expense reporting tool XMS - XMS, our online expense reporting tool, enables us to expedite, monitor and report expenses.  Effective July 1, all employees on domestic U.S. payroll will be required to use XMS for reimbursement of business-related expenses. To access XMS, go to http://xms.enron.com/.  

?	Enterprise wide portal - We currently have 122 internal web sites across the company.  The amount of technology work, marketing collateral, and other related costs required to develop and support so many portals is sizeable.  It makes sense to have one Enron portal so you can efficiently access content and services through a single, personalized channel that will make it easier for you to find information and perform basic tasks online.  This new company-wide portal, under the leadership of Tony Mends, will be launched in several phases beginning this fall.  

Another significant area where we can be more diligent in our spending is travel and entertainment.  Enron has long had travel policies in place.  As we have grown, we have not done as well as we should have in communicating those policies to new employees and reminding all employees to take advantage of the discounts we have negotiated.  The availability of discounts and booking services online should make it easy to save money for the company without sacrificing the comfort of employees who travel.  The following are common sense recommendations that we should all adhere to when traveling for business.  Any regular deviations from these travel policy recommendations will be reviewed by each business unit leader.

?	Air travel - Employees are requested to use either Travel Agency in the Park (TAP) or the GSS-approved preferred travel agency for your location - all of which have access to the significant airfare discounts negotiated by GSS - or http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron, the new online travel booking service that allows employees to book their own travel with the same negotiated discounts.  Employees who fly in the United States should book non-refundable coach tickets, which are typically 65 percent less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed by simply paying a $100 fee.  For this reason, we strongly encourage all employees to purchase non-refundable domestic coach tickets when possible.

?	Lodging - GSS has also negotiated preferred rates at a number of hotel chains in many cities worldwide to accommodate each business unit's individual hotel policy.  We recommend that you use Enron's list of preferred hotels to select accommodations that are in line with your business unit's policies.  You can view the list at http://travel.enron.com.

?	Car rental services - When renting a car for business travel, employees should use our preferred car rental agencies - National (U.S. and Canada) and Alamo (U.S.)- since the agreements we have negotiated are intended to protect you and Enron through the insurance coverage in our contract.  Visit http://travel.enron.com for details and updates to services available outside the U.S.

?	Off-site meetings - All domestic-U.S. off-site meetings and events with more than 10 people should be coordinated through GSS, which will negotiate preferred rates for Enron.  They can be reached at (713) 646-8311.

Because there are differences between business units and offices, each business unit leader will follow up this memo with a communication further elaborating on these policies as they apply to their business unit.

Each of us has a responsibility to make sure we do our part to ensure Enron retains its competitive edge.  These recommendations are some basic, sensible actions we can take company-wide, but it is up to every employee to look for cost saving measures and do what makes sense in your daily activities.  If you have an idea or a suggestion you would like to share with us, please e-mail us at recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com.   A list of questions and answers about these policies is posted on http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/csfaq.doc.  If you have additional questions, Policy Committee member Kevin Hannon will host an eSpeak on Tuesday, June 19 at 10 a.m. Houston time to discuss these cost saving recommendations.

"Noble Systems Executive Update","Jeffrey,

Trust all is well. Attached is our latest press release for Dynamic Campaign Builder (DCB 2.6) which enables non-programmers to develop and implement even complex contact center applications. Our 2 day DCB training class is given every week in Atlanta.

Also, we are announcing another new sales promotion starting this week: Buy Now and Start Paying in 2002. If you'd like the details, please advise and I'll forward them to you.

Noble Systems is part of the SR Teleperformance group, a $700+ Million Teleservices conglomerate with over 120 call centers and 16,000 employees. And our combined growth continues to be strong! After last year's significant expansions, overall sales revenues for this most recent quarter are up again some 31%  over the same quarter last year.

Among many financial advantages, our business relationship with Teleperformance also provides us with a comprehensive research and development environment for testing new technologies and software applications, within actual customer operations, prior to full-scale market release.

During the past 12 years Noble Systems Corporation has moved to the forefront in providing the world's best ""total solution"" value in call center and customer contact technology.  10,000+ agents at more than 500 client installations, conduct business from feature-rich Noble Systems workstations.  Over 2 million customer calls are managed every day utilizing our Predictive Dialing in conjunction with our ACD, Blended Call Processing, Digital Recording and IVR capabilities.

If you have not done so recently, please check out our yet further improved website at www.noblesys.com Among other enhancements, you will appreciate the new Search capability; simply enter keyword(s) and you can quickly get to the items of interest including our expanded library of customer success stories.

Again, our network-wide Graphical Manager workstation software is setting entirely new thresholds of effectiveness and productivity for managing agents and campaigns! You can now include each agent's picture on your real time production displays. Our next release will enable you to lay out these agent icons on your management displays into the same floor plan as your center - depicting each agent where they are actually sitting.

Jeffrey, have a great week and whenever I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to call me.

"Proposed Dabhol Power Company Press Release To Indian Media","Attached is a DPC press release that we would like to issue in India on Saturday morning their time.  Due to coverage of related issues, this timing is important.  We have been advised that these facts need to be disseminated to be responsive to the judge's remarks and before the Mumbai High Court  hearing scheduled for next week.  

The DPC press release is significantly more detailed than normal Enron practice, but is deliberately styled to be appropriate for an Indian audience.  In fact, we anticipate that a number of Indian publications will run the release verbatim.  Of course, this will likely result in international coverage, as well.  Any comments would be appreciated.  Please let me know if you need additional information.

"Moving foward at a good clip","
Steve
 
Good news.  As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week.  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership.  She explored my views about doing business with government.  Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26.  
 
Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16.  In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday.  (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.)
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet?
 
Thank you for your all of your help.  I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.  
 
Kevin

The iCan Provider Suite gives service providers, including IT departments that function like  internal corporate service providers (ICSPs) critical business tools to:   Meter resource usage across Internet domains  Set up a service catalog   Automatically provision customers   Rapidly roll out new services   Track costs and offer flexible payment terms  Monitor and enforce service level agreements (SLAs)   Drastically reduce operating expenses   In the words of iCan CEO, Nancy Li:  ""The iCan Provider Suite was built from the ground up to help service providers succeed in the Internet services market. It enables xSPs and corporate IT departments to boost service levels, curb expenses and strengthen their accountability to their customers.""      ""xSPs that intend to survive and create high-volume businesses must streamline and automate their service-management operations. In many ways, the software-as-services model - if executed correctly - operates like a utility model. The iCan Provider Suite is a complete solution for these requirements.""  ? Laurie McCabe, Vice President and Service Director for market researcher Summit Strategies      The iCan Provider Suite performs a series of highly-integrated operational and business support functions that, taken together, comprise a comprehensive service management solution for the full spectrum of service providers. The software, the first of its kind, is the culmination of a year-long, 200,000 man-hour development effort. Prior to the launch, beta testing in actual production environments was conducted at customer and partner sites over the previous seven months.  iCan is currently working with customers in the U.S., Europe and Asia who represent the full spectrum of xSPs. For more on these clients and what they're saying about the benefits of the iCan solution, click here .  The iCan Provider Suite consists of five complementary modules:    iCan View  - allows service providers and IT departments to create a service catalog, manage groups of users as separate accounts, support personalization, provide simplified data presentation and analysis, and reduce administrative overhead.   iCan Meter  - enables service providers to collect information from all data sources across domains and measure customer application, server and network activity.   iCan Assure  - allows service providers to define and measure service level agreements (SLAs) and create new service offerings without additional coding.   iCan Bill  - permits service providers to move beyond flat-rate pricing and price their services based on actual usage and cost of service.   iCan Provision  - allows IT departments and other service providers to automatically provision services for new users and accounts.  Please click here  for complete information on the launch and the full scope of the iCan Provider Suite.      [IMAGE]CLIENT SPOTLIGHT: THE iCAN PROVIDER SUITE HELPS A FULL-SERVICE ASP SHINE MORE BRIGHTLY  SOLAR Inc., Hong Kong's first full-service ASP, is on the fast track. Within one year of its formation, the service provider has established a strong presence in southern China and is rapidly expanding into the greater China market.  Experiencing rapid growth, SOLAR needs to bring on new customers quickly without adding to headcount. The iCan Provider Suite, according to SOLAR's CEO, Hera Siu, makes this possible.   [IMAGE]  ""SOLAR has saved significant administrative time and boosted our efficiencies by deploying the iCan Provider Suite,"" Siu says. ""This has freed-up staff to perform more revenue-generating tasks. With iCan Bill we have centralized and automated our billing process. Customer communications,"" she adds, ""have improved through the notices we are posting with iCan View.""  SOLAR was able to save significant administrative time on data collection and analysis by utilizing the iCan suite. The ASP was also able to monitor its data center's Internet connection. The streamlined operating environment freed the SOLAR staff to undertake cost-reducing and revenue-generating tasks, such as improving capacity management and performing data back-up services.  With the suite's iCan Bill component, SOLAR was also able to centralize and automate its billing process, further reducing the administrative work involved in consolidating and verifying invoices.  Customer communications costs were pared as well, by posting service notices through the iCan View component in lieu of mail or e-mail.

It was only fitting then, when it came time to select a service management platform, that KCCS chose the iCan solution, which is the most advanced and sophisticated set of business tools for service providers available today."" ? Mr. Hiroshi Kitamura managing director, KCCS  Click here  for detailed information on this customer partnership.      [IMAGE]iCAN HIGHLIGHTS FROM CA WORLD - SERVICING THE ENTERPRISE   [IMAGE]  The 'software-as-service' model is being adopted by corporate IT, and the iCan Provider Suite enables IT departments to function as internal corporate service providers (ICSPs). That message was well received last week at CA World in Orlando, Fla., where iCan representatives met with several hundred CIOs and senior IT managers and demonstrated the advantages of the iCan Provider Suite firsthand. While there were many questions, especially concerning how best to service customers in various industries, there was also a strong consensus on two key points: 1) The software-as-a-service model makes sense, because it helps IT more accurately gauge and reduce costs, manage service levels and justify budgets; and 2) whether it's for internal users or external customers, th! e ! iCan Provider Suite  addresses the critical functions needed to successfully provide IT services.

[IMAGE]   The iCan booth included four demo stations for iCan and our partners to demonstrate the real-world solutions that have been developed.

"Reunion Report","Jeff;  I returned home from a weekend visit to New Kensington and Pittsburgh
as I attended my 60th High School Reunion.  About 60 class members were there.
         The houses I grew up in and the old Neighborhoods are much smaller
than I remember;  the hills are higher and steeper than I remember; and my
former classmates are much older than I.  I have slept 10-12 hours each night
since I am back and am almost rested.  Thank goodness I flew to Pittsburgh as
I would really would have been a basket case if I had driven.  I did have a
good time.
        Jeff, I have been keeping up with your problems in California thru
various business web sites.  The pie incident sure points out the mentality
of some of Enron's critics.  You may end up a martyr before it is all over.
From what I can observe the Californians are getting little sympathy outside
their own state.  I am sure Enron is getting a lot of undeserved criticism
but I believe most think it is their own fault.  I only hope the whole mess
blows over so you can turn your full attention to you normal pursuits.
       Both Mother and I send our love          DAD

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/10/2001
Los Angeles Times

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis, who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records show. 
During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.
Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas & Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP. 
In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period. Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour, according to an analysis of the documents. 
The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power emergencies. 
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have reaped the highest profits over the longest period. 
""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said. 
""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400% above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte."" 
The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first quarter. 
The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not limited to a few generators. 
Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January. 
The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316 in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per hour to $271, the reports show. 
In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron, one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state, a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour. 
By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average charges of $330 per megawatt-hour. 
A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on. 
A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric, said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of producing the power needed by the state were extremely high. 
More Power Bought Than Projected 
Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts, coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas prices, have begun to tame the state's market. 
Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May, about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected. 
Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell short of state projections in June and early July. 
The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well under $100 a megawatt-hour. 
A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry closer to normalcy.""

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

When the Netherlands-based World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) scrapped its management-through-committee-oversight policy they had no idea how effective their new system would be.

Using operating groups called Target-Driven Activities (TDA), WWF learned that it is more effective to appoint a program manager and give him or her a budget and a relatively free hand.  ""This person is responsible,"" says Siegfried Woldhek, former head of the Netherlands organization of WWF, ""for the 'heart, head, and belly' of a project: the vision, the strategy, the day-to-day management, and the development of the people involved.""

The effects have been spectacular, sometimes nearly doubling the results of the former committee method.  Even more interesting are the possibilities that TDA management techniques hold for other, more commercial enterprises...something executives all over the world are beginning to consider.

For more information on TDA management, I suggest that you carefully read the Zealot Profile of Mr. Woldhek in the upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free?but it would be best if you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

Dear Jeff
 
There aren't any ""corporate speak"" words that can express what I feel, so I will use plain English:  I am thrilled that I will be working for you at Enron.  I look forward to helping you and your team continue to transform Enron into the number one company in the world and into the best company in the world.
 
I have sent my bio to Steve Kean and will send him my list of my preferred California contacts.  By mid-week, I will send you a cleaned-up version of the suggestions I outlined in our meeting.
 
I look forward to the next steps.  It is an honor to be working with you again.  I pledge to you my very best.

Subject:	thank you / proposed changes to offer


David
 
Thank you for  arranging for a nice weekend for Megan and me, and for setting-up a great day of  interviews.  Megan concluded the weekend comfortable with Houston and  open to making the move (although we still didn't see the 70 degree weather  you mentioned).  I enjoyed the opportunity to visit with everyone you  arranged and Greg was good enough to invest a couple of hours with me at the end  of the day discussing the Xcelerator in detail.
 
While I am excited  about the opportunity to have tremendous impact at Enron, I'm also realistic  about the challenges I face as an outsider working on a largely undefined   and untested project with mixed support outside of the top leadership  team.  I am up for the challenge, but there are a few modifications I would  like to make to your offer to mitigate these risks and ensure that I would have  the runway necessary to successfully build this effort.  Greg asked that I  relay these changes to you so the two of you could discuss them.  With  these following changes, I would be excited to join the team and make the  Xcelerator a success.
 
1.  Change  monthly salary to $16,667 ($200k/year)
2.  Establish  the top 65% performance rating ($200,000) as the minimum bonus for 2001  (pro-rated) and 2002, to be pro rated if terminated by Enron.  (Of  course, this would not apply if I am terminated ""for cause"" or resign.)  
3.  Six months  continuation of salary and benefits in the event that I am terminated by Enron  within 24 months of joining the company.  (Again, not applicable if ""for  cause"" or resign.)
4.  Allow me to  commute from my home in LA for up to 90 days.  (We'd anticipate more like  45-60, but we have commitments until early August and will need to re-lease our  home.)
5.  Allow for 1  day of vacation in July and 1 week in August (trips with Megan's family to which  I am already committed.)
 
Please feel free to  contact me if you have any questions or comments.  I can be reached via  cell phone at 626-278-1746.
 
Thanks  again.

"Enron Principal Investments Presentation Issues (Advance Notice)","Jeff and Andy,

I wanted to make you both aware of a component of Enron Principal Investments' proposed strategy, prior to presenting to you next week.

We are proposing to raise a traditional private equity fund to provide the capital for EPI's investing efforts.  I have been researching the pros and cons of a fund (including talking with Bill Brown, Michael Kopper and others who have worked on these at Enron in the past).  In this case, I believe the positives sufficiently outweigh the negatives.  Of course, if EPI pursues this fund, it would be done in-conjunction with the finance group.

Here are my assumptions:

Fund Structure*
Total Fund Size				$500 million
Enron's Commitment			$125 million
Institutional Investors			$375 million
Enron's Management fees		1.5% - 2.0% 
Enron Carried Interest			20%-25%
LP Preferred Return			6%-8%
Investment Period			3-4 years
Fund Life				8-10 years
* This would be structured as a traditional private equity fund structured using normal market terms.

Negatives
Reduced flexibility 
Manage for IRR not earnings
Exclusivity issues

Positives
Reduces Enron's ongoing capital requirements
Greater capital availability to EPI
Secure a dedicated funding source
Generate a leveraged return for Enron and annual management fees
Allow for retention of key personnel over the long term

We can discuss this at length in our presentation, but I wanted to give you advanced notice.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland

Subject:	RTO Orders - Grid South, SE Trans, SPP and Entergy

The Southeast RTO orders are out and have followed through with what we expected from the discussion at the FERC meeting.

The SPP and Entergy RTO proposals have been rejected because they fail to satisfy the scope and configuration requirements of Order No. 2000.  The Commission  notes that the required discussions between SPP and Entergy and its neighboring RTO/TOs has led to no increase in the original scope and configuration.  The filings by SPP and Entergy were brief, indicating only a lack of interest by other RTOs or utilities in joining to enlarge scope; they failed to specify any details of the talks, what changes could be made or what could be fixed to accomodate combination with other RTOs.  The order states that the Commission favors the development of large, regional transmission organizations reflecting natural markets.  The Commission indicates that they favor four RTOs - NE, SE, MW and West.  Therefore the order requires the participants in SPP and Entergy to participate in settlement discussions as set out in the mediation order.  Note that these meetings will start next Tuesday, July 17 before a FERC ALJ.

The Southern Company RTO is also found by the FERC to fail the scope characteristics of Order No. 2000.  The order finds that Southern's approach to focus on MOUs and seams issues with its neighbors is inadequate.  The order states, ""We reiterate: the Commission's goal is to have a single RTO in the Southeast, and to have that single RTO operational as soon as possible.""  The Commission recognizes that start-up costs in forming a larger RTO may be more, but that over the longer term, large RTOs will foster market development, will provide increased reliability and will result in lower wholesale electricity prices.  The order therefore directs the parties to the mediation as stated above.

The Grid South participants are also directed to the mediation which is starting on next Tuesday.  It is a lengthier order with more details on other aspects of RTOs, including Independent Board requirement, congestion managment, interconnection procedures, planning process and CBM.  Therefore, I am attaching a summary of the order.  One of the important findings of the order is that GridSouth is not sufficiently independent; the Applicant TOs are making policy decisions that should be made by an independent board.  Therefore, the order requires GridSouth to install an independent board and file a compliance filing within 90 days.

If anyone wants copies of the orders, let me know.

"Thank you, Corp!","
Thank you, Corp!

Friday's United Way Appreciation Lunch was great fun.  Team Corp and their amazing Lego structure, which won an award for being the Most United, made us proud.  Congratulations to all of the team members: Ed Coats, David Gorte, Bob Hermann, Amy Kim, Mark Palmer, Greek Rice, Chip Schneider, Jim Steffes, Mike Terraso, Dennis Vegas.

Now let's show all of Enron that Corp employees are as generous as we are bold, smart, ambitious and innovative.

At Friday's lunch, we received a little challenge from Stan Horton, CEO of Enron Transportation Services. He's betting homemade cookies that by close of business on Monday, August 13 ETS will have a higher percentage of their overall goal than all of the other business units. I do not want to be up all night baking chocolate chip cookies for Stan, so I think we need to accept his challenge and blow ETS, EWS and EES out of the water!

The good news is that to date, Corp has raised $506,743, which is about 65% of our total goal of $785,000. 

The bad news is that only 21% of Corp employees have participated in the campaign so far.

If you are part of that 21% that has already given to the United Way, THANK YOU.  Your contribution makes a difference right here in our community.

If you haven't made your contribution, you still have time.  Please log on to <http://home.enron.com> and click on the United Way link today to make your contribution.  You'll need your GIS number to make your contribution.  Your GIS number is an eight-digit number that starts with a 9.

If you don't have your GIS number and password or need assistance with keying in your contribution, please call Kathy Mayfield at ext. 3-3264.  

Please remember that contributions made last year don't automatically roll over to this year.  You'll need to log on and make another contribution this year.

Your contribution to the United Way has an impact on one out of every two lives in the Houston community.  Don't miss the opportunity to play a role in Building Houston's Future.

Jeff

Jeff:

Attached find a term sheet that we are ready to send to Global Crossing. 

As you know my team has been negotiating a deal for the sale of our dark fiber assets for cash and an obligation on the part of EBS to buy future services at market from the counterparty.  I am far down the road with Qwest, lagging with Level 3 and Global Crossing.  The terms proposed here for Global Crossing would upgrade their previous bid from ""not even close"" to ""very competitive"" but would still not guarantee a deal.  Global Crossing has some tough challenges (credit) that some others don't.

Call if you would like to discuss.

"eThink About It: 06/18/01","

Do you ever get the feeling that the idea you posted into the Idea Vault isn't looked at by anyone or going anywhere?  Well, listen to this.  Steve Gullion, EES IT manager, deposited an idea about economic data derivatives.  And guess what?  The Xcelerator liked the idea so much that they are now working on a business plan.  
Go to the Thinkbank (http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/Thinkbank.nsf/HomePage?OpenPage) now and post the idea that has been brewing in your brain!


We've all heard Jeff Skilling say we need to ""earn our way out"" of the current Enron share price slump.  One way we can accomplish this is by doing a better job of managing company expenses.  Ask Kevin Hannon, CEO of Enron Global Asset Services and Policy Committee member, all your questions about how we can earn our way out, together.  Tuesday, June 19 on eSpeak at 10 a.m. Houston time.

Can't make the live event?  No worries.  Go to eSpeak (http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp) now and submit your question.  Kevin will try to answer it during his event and you can read the transcript later.


After Kevin's eSpeak, we'll be opening a category in  eMeet http://nahou-lnapp01.corp.enron.com/eThink/eMeet.nsf called ""Cost Savings Initiatives"" so you can continue talking amongst yourselves and helping Enron save.  (And if you've got some great cost saving ideas, don't forget you can put them into the Idea Vault in the ThinkBank!)

"HR Organizational Changes","
In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

?	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

?	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

?	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

?	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

?	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

?	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

?	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

"The Grubman.","Jeff, I wouldn't be too concerned about calling you-know-who an asshole.  I don't think it hurt ""W"" too much, and it gave us all something to talk and/or chuckle about.  I am very fond of using it myself, but my favorites are ""dickhead"" and ""dickbrain.""  In fact, I used them so frequently that my husband urged me to use a Spanish translation, which turned out to be Ricardo Cabeza and Ricardo Sesos (pronounced ""say-sos"").  Please feel free to use those anytime you feel the urge.

Seriously, thanks for the good things that are happening at our company.  The stock is looking better, and us old folks appreciate that.  Hope you are taking time to enjoy life as well.  Are you doing the MS150 this year?  Good luck in all your endeavors.  Fondly, Peggy

"Book Interview Today","Ken/Jeff -- You are scheduled to each do a one-hour in-person interview today with Rick Kash, author of a book, ""The New Law of Supply and Demand.""  Norm Blake requested your participation in this project.  The book has been purchased by Doubleday and will be published next summer.   The premise of the book is that the world economy has moved from supply-driven to demand-driven, and successful companies are those that understand how demand drives supply.  The book also includes case studies of EMC and McDonald's.   We will have the opportunity to review the manuscript before it goes to press.

The interview schedule is:
	1:30 to 2:30 p.m. - Jeff
	2:30 to 3:30 p.m. - Ken

I will bring Rick to your office at these times and will sit in on the interview to coordinate any follow-up requests.

Thank you.

Jeff, 
Knowing that ENE is making market in the paper industry I thought it would be  
of interest to you to possibly work a deal with DOMTAR (DTC) who just  
announced earnings were cut in half due to energy costs.  Sounds like an  
opportunity there.

Attached is the email from Jorge.  We are in the process of terminating Jorge due to performance and relation issues.  We are doing this immediately due to the nature of Jorge's job, although we were trying to delay until the replacement was in place.  Given recent actions (not the email below), we have decided to move forward with the termination this afternoon.

"FINAL A&A Mid-Yr PRC Meeting - Wed July 18, 2:30-4:00 PM, eb 50M","
We've now completed the operating unit Mid-Year PRC meetings, and each group did an excellent job hitting or coming very close to the preferred distributions.  As you know, we have planned the final meeting for next Wednesday July 18, to review the operating unit distributions, and to discuss the top (1) and bottom (5) category performers.  The meeting is scheduled for 2:30-4:00 PM in EB 50M (we have reduced the time slot from 2 1/2 hours to 90 minutes).  Below is the meeting agenda, and I look forward to seeing you there.

Agenda
I.  Review of Distributions (30 minutes)
	a.  Overall Program (Analyst I, Analyst II, Associates, Combined) 
	b.  By Meeting Group (Analyst I, Analyst II, Associates, Combined)

II.  Discussion of Top and Bottom Performers  (45 minutes)
	a.  Who they are....
	b.  Their achievements and attributes.......

III.  Wrap Up  (15 minutes)

Note:  The focus of the meeting will be Western Hemisphere, but we will discuss the Eastern results at a very high level (hit preferred distributions, etc.)

After this meeting, we will advise the PRC Reps and Supervisors by email that it is ok to provide feedback to their employees.  My recommendation is that PRC Reps and Supervisors provide the relative ranking cluster, if asked by the employee.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, and thanks to each of you for your help and leadership in this process.

BRAZIL
Summary
Defining Brazilian Central Bank's crisis strategy: Facing dilemma of raising rates decisively now or holding fire while waiting on Argy; real can wait
IMF and US Treasury: still behind Brazil, behind the scenes, while giving Argentina an opportunity to extricate itself from its current problems
Fraga will seek to avoid repeat of last month's mistakes: will not weaken a large rate rise with easing bias again; will not give market new targets to bet against 

Report
Some arguing a decisive pre-emptive raise - as much as 675bp to 25% by central bank.  In light of the unsettled situation in Argentina and market response to Turkey's 400bp increase (met with continued selling pressure: lira set new lows, bonds down) there may be a move to conserve ammunition in case of a Argentina-induced external shock.  Despite breaking through 2.6BRR/$, the real held and rallied today.  Wait-and-see approach may be chosen on fears of a challenge to a rate rise fueling an upward rate spiral amidst further real depreciation. Central bank not expected to hold interventions to $50 mil./day, particularly if there are further problems in Argy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

ARGENTINA
Summary
Domestic politics continues to drive near-term outcome 
Cavallo continues to freelance, yielding uncertainty at home and abroad
Latest trial balloons focus on prepayment of taxes by banks and privatized companies
Letes swap talk still swirling
Next Letes auction scheduled for next Tuesday (7/24), something has give
Endgames: political compromise and/or Letes swap; tax prepay compromise; Cavallo going to international bankers for 'non-confrontational', voluntary restructuring; (if Cavallo goes) 'confrontational' default and/or breaking of convertibility peg

Report
If resolution does not come before Friday (both political and on Letes swap), expect a very long weekend in Buenos Aires as G-8 leaders meet in Genoa.
For now, holding pattern continues as no news is the news.  Latest figures from the central bank (from Thursday) show continued hemorrhaging of foreign reserves.  Capital flight is a key risk factor in the pace of crisis.  FRB debt trading below August 1998 lows.  Despite hue and cry of contagion fears, debt markets outside of Argy still holding up.  Wall St., Pennsylvania Ave. (WH and UST), and IMF still on the same talking points about rhetorical support but no new funds committed.  Even in the currency channel the resilience of the Mexican peso, Chilean peso has been notable.  In Brazil, the real continues to bear the brunt of the assault, but the steepness of the slide has attenuated.  Further evidence of 'Brazil-as-defensible' line from the investment community in concert with behind the scenes IMF and governments support.
 
Opposition political (Peronist) leadership and several provincial governors have yet to lend support for President De La Rua's austerity plan.  Despite repeated expectations of agreement from Friday evening on, the Peronist governors have stalled, arguing that they cannot commit until the governing coalition has agreed its plan between its partners.  Alfonsin and leftwing Radicals and junior coalition Frepaso party continue to seek adjustments to the De La Rua-Cavallo austerity package in order to protect their working class and lower middle class bases.  Rhetoric continues to reinforce nationalist populist imperatives.

Cavallo's team started spreading the rumor in Argentina that the US was going to help (e.g., telling friends about Cavallo's call to Condi Rice), hoping to spur confidence; instead forced the US to deny it.  Bush's letter to De La Rua offered little more than to say that our prayers are with Argentina.  A national unity government might not include Cavallo if Alfonsin and leftwing of Radical party gains sway in negotiations.

The economic team is initiating conversations with the privatized companies (including utilities) and banks in order to push them to pay next year's taxes in advance.  The goal is to collect $2 bil.  This number will cover the estimated deficit for the 2H01 ($1.5bil.).  The banks should advance $1 bil., and the privatized companies another $1 bil.  Repsol has already agreed to advance $150 mil.  Cavallo talked personally with the Presidents of the Spanish companies  (Telef?nica, Telecom, Endesa, etc.) and some Italians.  If successful, these collections will improve this year's numbers and would satisfy Alfonsin and the left wing by allowing normal social spending.

Repeat of drip, drip of market information ala May-June 'mega-swap'.  Goal: swap $4.8 bil. in 91-day debt still to be auctioned during remainder of 2001 into a 1-year bond, a structured product for domestic pension funds, and/or special mutual funds.  Details promised by Wednesday.  Optics tied to political bargaining.  Last Letes auction though fully funded to $800+ mil. goal was not oversubscribed as usual and primary dealers unable to pass it along.

"Your corner on the intranet","Jeff --

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of interest to them.  We're also looking to increase your exposure with employees.  We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a couple of weeks ago.  It's called ""Jeff's Corner"" and it will be a regular video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 99.9% of our employees.  

This is how it will work.  We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking about what's top of mind at that moment.  The tone and style will be like your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and conversational.  We suggest the first topic be ""The State of Enron.""  There is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are  beginning to affect morale.  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.  You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability to do this in-house at very low cost.  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could even tape a message to employees weekly.  The nice thing about this medium is we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you speak to employees gives the message credibility.  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Mary

Jeff -- 

Tomorrow at 3 p.m., you are scheduled for a one hour interview with James Thompson, a freelance writer working for the quarterly NY Stock Exchange Magazine.  The editors would like the story to focus on how we go about applying our business model to new markets, including how we decide what markets to pursue.  I have also asked Mike McConnell to provide a global markets perspective.  I think the story will probably lean on your personality and leadership style as well.  Because it is a NYSE publication, we get to read it first. 

Please let me know if you have questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you at 3 p.m.

Thanks

"On The Learning Center","Greetings!  All's well today as we finally see sunshine in Houston.

Meanwhile, I thought you would enjoy hearing Texas A&M University hosted
reception last Thursday, celebrating our J.V. in the Lockard & White
Learning Center.  Actual market requests helped define classes developed
specifically for telecom, utilities, and energy firms - also, take a
peek at www.lwlc.com.

These courses, designed based on requests from U.S. companies, fulfill a
market need for professional training in the telecommunications arena.
It is a Win-Win program in which all benefit from better trained
professionals and industry leaders.

We look forward to exploring with you ways in which we may partner
on domestic U.S. and international initiatives as well.

"Results of the Judging for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce.","The World Technology Network, 
London, United Kingdom. 
3 July 2001 
  
TO:   All Nominees for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce. 
On Monday evening, 2 July, at a gala ceremony held here in London at the National Museum of Science & Industry, we announced the Finalists and Winners of the 2001 World Technology Awards.  The Awards ceremony was held at the close of the World Technology Summit, which brought together many of this year's Award nominees from around the world, along with previous Winners, Finalists, and Nominators (the WTN membership).  The Winner and other Finalists are automatically inducted as Members of the WorldTechnology Network.  All other other nominees for the Awards now become Associates of the World Technology Network.  (NOTE: We will be contacting separately those Finalists who were unable to attend the Summit and Awards ceremony). On behalf of the WTN membership, and our global partners -- Nasdaq, GlaxoSmithkline, Enron, Business Week, CNBC, and Nature,  we are very pleased to announce the Winners and Finalists for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce: 
2001 World Technology Award for Commerce 
Winner: 
Mr. Linus Torvalds, Programmer, Transmeta Corp., USA. 
Finalists:

Prof. Richard Friend, Cavendish Professor of Physics, Optoelectronics Group, Cavendish Laboratory, University of Cambridge, UK. 
Ms. Mari Matsunaga, Designer, I-mode, NTT-DoCoMo, Japan; Editor-in-Chief, e-Woman, Japan. 
Mr. Tom Siebel, Founder, Siebel Systems, USA. 
The World Technology Awards process is designed to identify and honour the most innovative people in the technology world.  The Nomination for all of the various World Technology Awards involved well over 100 expert Nominators from across the globe, who suggested those individuals doing the work of the greatest likely long-term significance in their respective fields. Then, over the past few months, the WTN membership reviewed the nominations and selected their top five within their own Award category.  To even be nominated for the Award meant that one of the Nominators felt a Nominee was amongst the top few in the world and for that all nominees deserve huge congratulations. 
The Nominators for the 2001 World Technology Award for Commerce were: 
Prof. Chong-ji Choi Director, MBA Programme, Cambridge University, UK. 
Prof. Soumitra Dutta, Director, ELab@INSEAD, INSEAD, France. 
Dr. Gerhard Fasol, President, Eurotechnology,  Japan. 
Mr. David Ticoll, Managing Partner & CEO, Digital4Sight, USA. 
The eligible Judges from amongst the WTN membership for the Award were: 
Mr. John Griffith 
Mr. Tom Leighton 
Mr. Danny Lewin 
Mr. Brad Miller 
Mr. Ziv Navoth 
Ms. Faith Popcorn 
Prof. John Riedl 
Mr. Stephan Schambach 
Mr. Steven Snyder 
Mr. Richard Stallman 
Mr. Harald Summa 
Mr. Axel van Drongelen 
Mr. Alan Webber 
As some nominees were not able to attend the World Technology Summit (1 and 2 July), held at Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, we made sure that we videotaped each of the Summit plenary sessions of the as well as the Awards ceremony for ""webcast.""  It should take at least a few weeks to 
get that presentation ready, but we will notify you as soon as it is so that you can get a taste for the extraordinary gathering which occured here in London over the past few days. 
For a full list of Winners and Finalists for the 2001 World Technology Awards in all 23 categories, and for more information about the World Technology Network, please visit the WTN web site at:  http://www.wtn.net .

"Your trip","Sukran and Mark;  We had a good visit with Jeff and Rebecca last week and
heard the good news about their engagement.  They left Sunday morning to go
back to Houston.
     Our heat wave finally broke last night.  We had about 2 weeks of close
to 90 degree weather every day and the heat index climbed over 105 degrees on
many days.  As with most people we stayed close to home.
      I called the Chicago Motor Club and they will send me maps and other
info for your trip up to Minnesota.   It is a beautiful drive particularly
along the Mississippi.
       Don't forget to send me your Flight Number and local takeoff time and
I can keep track of your flight location along the way.  There may be a
problem on a foreign flight but I haven't heard of one.
       We are sure looking forward to meeting Sukran.
      Mother and I send Lots of Love and Kisses to both of you.      Dad

Wholesale grid to be
90% open in 2-3 years

Enron Chief of Staff Steve Kean ""has been actively involved in getting
this stuff done,"" said CEO Jeff Skilling in introducing Kean to a
conference call last week.
     Today's wholesale power market, Enron finds is only about 20-25%
open.
     ""This is going to push for something close to 100%,"" Kean forecast
but he wants to see how FERC deals with public power first.
     ""It's going to be a significant, a significant expansion of the
industrial market,"" he predicted, ""to 80 or 90% levels within a
relatively short period of time.""
     As Kean reads FERC, ""they appear to be getting rid of pancaking of
rates ... We're going to have 100 potential supply sources we're going
to be able to put in touch with thousands of markets.
     ""It's even more significant than simply getting open access tariffs
across the individual utility systems.
     ""We're going to be able to move power from where it is to where
it's needed.""  Kean thinks the RTOs will facilitate the opening of
retail markets.
     ""As we get more workably competitive wholesale markets it's going
to increase our ability to deliver away from traditional pooling points
and serve retail energy markets as well.
     ""A huge step forward and a dramatic increase, a multiple increase
in the investible market,"" he told analysts.
     Skilling agreed with Kean's numbers and went a step farther
predicting the 20% open shift to 90% open will happen in the next two or
three years.
     ""We're serving 30,000 sites,"" Skilling noted.  ""We can physically
get power to only about 20% of those locations given the constrictions
in the grid and the difficulty of moving across the grid.
     ""This will make it much, much easier to get power much further out
from the market centers where we've been operating today,"" Skilling
forecast.

"Energy Outsource-DuPont Corp. Campus","Jeff:
Just a heads up, I am meeting with Gary Pfeiffer, CFO in a couple of weeks to brief him on discussions we have been having with a team of DuPont managers about a deal that looks a bit like the Lilly deal, DuPont's outsourcing of its Corporate campus, including a number of lab buildings in Wilmington.   

As you remember, we met with Pfeiffer and a few others here on 50 to discuss their risk mgmt strategies around gas....those discussions went nowhere, but we are now back and actively engaged with personnel in his group on this outsource opportunity.  

Doubt he would call, but  I wanted you in the loop.

"Respect Integrity, Communication, Excellence Policies","Sirs,

A numerous times that it was mentioned that you have an open door policy, 
and I am taking the opportunity to write this memo to inform you of issues 
that I felt were not handled in the manner of the Enron's policies.

 In April of this year, there was a job posting for a position with Global
Markets for a Director of Transportation.  A business associate here at Enron
informed me that there was a position and it would fit my husband 's (Bob)
qualification and years of experience.  This business associate knew of my husband's 
qualifications from business dealing when employed by EI/EECC.

I submitted Bob's resume on line for this position, in fact there
were two positions, one for Director and Manager.  Within a week he
received a phone call from a Mr.Peter Weinberg of Human Resources to discuss
the possibility of an interview and to discuss in further detail about his
experience.  Mr. Weinberge and Bob corresponded a number of times
that week, Mr. Weinberge requested on a Wednesday evening that my
husband fill out an questionnaire that would further demonstrate Bob's
qualifications.  Mr. Weinberge stated that he needed it by Thursday so he
can present this to the hiring manager, Mr.Martin Gleason.  Bob was lead to believe
that he had a possibility of an interview.

No additional correspondence was again heard from Mr. Weinberge, in fact,
through other sources, I found out a candidate was extended an offer for the
position on Thursday.

 Both my husband and me were not upset that he did not get an interview, but
was disappointed with the lack of integrity from HR.  If HR had a candidate
in mind, why would they contact my husband and have him take the time to
work on the questionnaire?

It is understandable that they offered the position to a candidate, but Bob
should have received some type of correspondence from the HR representative.
Bob did call Peter in June and Mr.Weinberge told him that he was
surprised that my husband never received any correspondence from the hiring
manager.

I fully understand that internal candidates should be considered first, but
it is very disappointing to see the situation handled in this manner.  The
company prides itself on open Communication and Integrity, but this is not
the first time such an occurrence has happened.
.
Since the first initial contact between Bob and HR, there have been a few
positions posted in the Global Markets area.  The postings have stated they
are looking for candidates  with transportation/contract negotiation experience,
and not once did we hear from HR for a possibility of an interview.

I do not know if this letter will change anything, but I could not just let
it go.  I thank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to
review this.  I look forward to hearing from you.

"Summer Internship","Dear Mr. Skilling,

	My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley's son.   I am
writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I am
majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For the
first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports camp
leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at all
possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

"FW: MSN - Jesse Call Summary","
Latest MSN update.  This is all positive.  I believe we are addressing issues and executing.  Rich
 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Plante, Everett  
Sent:	Tuesday, July 31, 2001 2:01 PM
To:	Dimichele, Rich; Fallon, Jim; Seeligson, Stewart; Schrage, Adam; Racicot, Paul
Cc:	Suarez, John; Sarkissian, Arshak; Enochs, Fred; Giles, Gene; Easterby, David; Plante, Everett
Subject:	MSN - Jesse Call Summary

Summary of call with Jesse Nunoz - MSN - Business Development - July 31, 2001

LEC Turn up Delays - Jesse has agreed for Verizon MSAs to add an additional 30 days to the termination clause of 120 days.  This will allow us effectively 180 days to get Verizon MSAs up and into services. (150 + 30 days for cure)

Acceptance Period - Jesse has agreed to shorten the acceptance period to 7 days beginning on Sept 24th, and to change the wording on the cure period Materially significant failures would need to be cured in 14 days,  all other failures the cure would be negotiated. Materially Significant would translate to those failures that would make the MSA unavailable.  The acceptance period remains just for the four cities. (LA, Atlanta, Houston, & NY)

Circuit Cancellation Charges - Fred Enochs determined that cancellation charges would only be incurred after circuit turn-up and acceptance by EBS,  however once the circuit is in place EBS would pay the 12 mos. Contract,  if we terminate.  Therefore, I approached Jesse with the idea that we would keep both circuits and MSN would pay us for the cost of the circuit until their forecast commercially required the use of that circuit. (OK that is the FOX watching the Hen house).  He tentatively agreed to this approach,  waiting on the details on the FOC dates and cost estimates. 

Quest - Jesse indicated that he has received a call from Quest where they were expressing concern over our capacity in place in their (Quests) five cities. Jesse and I agreed to schedule a call with Quest  to go over their concerns and determine what actions if any needs to be taken.  This may be our opportunity to begin the conversation on the ""Build to Forecast"" issue we have with the agreement.  I will be sure to include Fred in that call.

Jesse agreed to have legal language back to me this week addressing the aforementioned topics.  I will work with legal to insure we are ready to respond.

Regards,

Everett

"RE: Interview","Joannie: Thank you very much. I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion. 

Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?

How have your views on leadership changed over time?

How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?

What motivates you and how do you motivate others?

Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?

What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry?

Subject:	Interview


In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

"Digital Storm - deadline May 18th.","
Hi  Jeff,
 
I am following up on  a confidential manuscript I sent you a few days ago of ""Digital Storm  - Fresh business strategies from the Electronic Marketplace"".  Is is a book about B2B E-Commerce and E-Markets after the hype. It will be  distributed by Wiley this summer as an A+ title (lead category) and Hasso  Plattner, CEO of SAP wrote the preface.
 
Enron is  featured as the most successful marketplace to date with a bright  future.
 
I was wondering,  whether you would like to include a testimonial for the book.  It would certainly also be good marketing for Enron's entry into new  marketplaces. For your convenience I include a potential  quote:
 
Running  the world's largest electronic marketplace, we embrace the opportunities and  challenges of B2B E-Commerce. In 'Digital Storm' Philipp Gerbert and his  colleagues give a powerful analysis of what has been learnt and invaluable  insights for future strategies in this area. 
(you can of course  write what you want; more ideas are in the attachment, which also contains  additional information).
 
I apologize that  this is a bit urgent - the deadline is Friday this week  May 18th). 
 
I very much hope  that you enjoy the manuscript. Perhaps you would be interested to further  discuss the ideas. 
 
Best regards, Phil  Gerbert

Jeff and Andy,

Thank you for your time yesterday.  The meeting went well and I believe we now have a lot of momentum to move forward on all fronts.

I met with Felicia Garland today to recap the meeting and want to summarize for you both:

	Broadband: Felicia met with Kim Godfrey, EBS, this morning as well and they are moving forward to get a meeting set up to get David Cox and John Echols
		in front of Bob Golden and others who make operational decisions within Pru.  

	RAC meeting:  Felicia and I went through the list of who Enron would bring to the table and she is going to confer with Matt Chanin regarding who Pru would bring and 		determine the best location and time for the meeting.  

		We expect that both of these meetings will not happen until July.

	Voluntary Platform (or Working Solutions):  A meeting is scheduled for this Thursday with Pru and Jennifer Medcalf (Enron Global Strategic Sourcing), Sarah Davis 		and Cynthia Barrow (both with Enron HR).  Andy, if you feel it is appropriate, a call to Cynthia Barrow might be helpful.

	New Power Company:  Felicia is very excited about including a ""portal"" for NPW in their voluntary platform and would also like to possibly extend that to their 			corporate relocation platform.  Andy, let me know the best way to proceed after you call Gene Lockhart. 

	Corporate Relocation:  We didn't talk much about this yesterday but Felicia is going to pursue Pru offering their services to Enron.  She will contact Jennifer Medcalf 		to get an introduction to the appropriate person.

Again, thank you for being available yesterday.

Shirley

"The Morning Market Call - Monday August 20th, 2001."," <<MF August 20th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The focus of attention for the markets this week will be tomorrow's meeting
by the Federal Reserve. According to Lehman Brothers' economists, the
downward revision to second quarter GDP growth into negative territory will
be disturbing to the Fed, as will the sharp drop in the Philadelphia Fed
index in July and the continuing deterioration in stock prices. However, the
markets are seeing evidence that the inventory correction process is coming
to an end. Against this background, they expect the Fed to cut the funds
rate another 25 basis point, to 3.5%.

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.48%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.93%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.49%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.52 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.37 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

Mkt Cap: $9.7B EPS 2002 $1.00E $0.50E $0.99E 57.6
FY: 10/31 Price Target $50 N/A
Rank 1 3
*We are now officially downgrading our rating on CIEN shares to 3-Market
Perform from 1-Strong Buy because even after a
precipitous decline in the share price we do not see the shares providing
any reasonable return for at least the next six months and
believe further downside is possible.
*Assuming CIENA's long-haul DWDM sales decline 20% YoY in FY02, we
anticipate FY02 total sales of $1.80 bil, up 12% YoY vs.
$2.44 bil and 40% YoY gr previously. This translates to CY01 and CY02 sales
of $1.66B and $1.935B (+16%) vs. $1.92B and
$2.65B (+38%) previously.
*We now est FY02 EPS falling to $0.50 from $0.61 in FY01 versus our previous
est of $0.74 and $1.00. This translates to new CY01
and CY02 EPS estimates of $0.52 and $0.59 (+13% YoY) vs $0.77 and $1.10
(+43% YoY) in our previous model.
*In our view, overall potential upside to our current sales forecasts is at
least equally matched by the overall potential downside from
current levels.

FOCUS STOCKS

Specialty Chemicals T. Gerdeman, .312.609.4031
Which Chemical Co.'s Benefit From A Weak U.S. Dollar?
*Given the declining U.S. dollar vs. major foreign currencies, it is
worthwhile to review the geographical sales composition of our
U.S. specialty chemical co.'s. The U.S. dollar has been particularly weak
vis-a-vis the Euro, hence we place disproportionate
weighting on the European component of each respective co.'s sales. Select
co.'s hedge their currency exposure, others have dollar-denominated
int'l. sales, hence it is impossible for us to estimate the exact benefit
for a given co. Directionally, however, we clearly
can develop a sense for the biggest beneficiaries.
*Co.'s possessing the greatest % of sales from Europe, in descending order,
include: OMG, SIAL, CBM, and EC. A weaker dollar
could make them more cost-competitive, boosting sales and EPS.

non-relationship syndicated exposure and $1.3B communications
and telecom portfolios.
*As most past credit problems were centered in the non-relationship
syndicated, not the broader corporate portfolio, we question
whether the reorientation toward greater consumer exposure, in large part on
a wholesale basis, will add value.
*Due to the market action in the stock and results of our DCF analysis, we
are refining our target price to $36 from $30.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Waste Management(WMI) 1 - Strong Buy T. Ford, .212.526.9127

FY: 12/31 Price Target $36 $36
Rank 1 1
*We spent 2 days on the road with WMI senior management. The turnaround
appears to be progressing according to schedule with
management noting (1) comfort with near-term EPS expectations and (2) a
continued belief that WMI, over time, will be successful
in driving margins into line with that of its peers.
*Multiple cost reduction & price based initiatives appear to be on track to
drive the material step-up in margin & EPS expected in 2H
01.
*Mgmt remains comfortable with its ability to drive margins & earnings
higher over the longer-term given numerous opportunities for
operational improvement & continued buy-in by the field regarding cost
reduction/productivity & price based initiatives.
*Mgmt confident in a 2H 01 settlement of the class action suit, but the
process is setting the pace.
*Retaining 2001 & 2002 EPS estimates of $1.33 a $1.70. Reiterate Strong Buy
& $36 year-end target.

Cardinal Health(CAH) 1 - Strong Buy L. Marsh, .212.526.5315

FY: 6/30 Price Target $83 $83
Rank 1 1
*We continue to recommend purchase of shares of Cardinal, after its
analyst/investor meeting held last Thursday, August 16, and
provide some observations & perspectives.
*Key observations - 1) company did a very good job of building a bottoms-up
model as to how it gets to its top-line (and operating
profit) guidance, by division, in our view. 2) Company's tax rate will
continue to be a positive lever to EPS this year, though an
additional 40-50 basis point reduction, and could also see some further
reduction in FY03.
*In addition, 3) company's CFFO guidance of $800-$900mm could once again
turn out to be nicely conservative, in our view. 4) leads
to company's view of EPS visibilty being ""extremely high"".
*We would also note, of keen importance, implementation of FAS142 provides
""new world"" of acquistion flexibility for CAH, leading
to good possibility of action over next 1-5 months, in our view. Confirm $83
target for well-positioned co., rep. 29x our current C02
cash earnings of $2.85.

Jabil Circuit, Inc(JBL) 2 - Buy L. Miscioscia, .212.526.3472
Weak End Markets Take Their Toll Again
OLD NEW STREET P/E

Mkt Cap: $4.5B EPS 2002 $0.94E $0.72E $0.91E 31.7
FY: 8/31 Price Target $40 $30
Rank 2 2
*On Wednesday 8/15 of last week we commented on a mid day break-in that
recent checks indicated business at some of our EMS
providers could remain flattish for the remainder of this year, and into
next, and highlighted Jabil as one of these providers.
*After further review we are going to lower our FY02 estimates for Jabil due
to our checks and very slow end market demand. While
we believe Jabil is benefiting from some industry consolidation wins, and
the Marconi ramp, some business is moving away from the
company to lower cost suppliers.
*For FY02 our revenue est moves to $4.5B, up 3% y/y but down from our prior
$5B est, and for EPS to $0.72 vs our prior $0.94. Our
CY02 estimate goes to $0.82 down from $1.09. Our new price target is $30,
down from $40. We retain our 2-Buy rating.

Fleming Companies, Inc(FLM) 1 - Strong Buy M. Adler, .212.526.7146
An Extraordinary Buying Opportunity (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.20 EPS 2000 N/A $1.56 N/A N/A

Mkt Cap: $1.5B EPS 2002 $2.55E $2.55E $2.55E 11.1
FY: 12/31 Price Target $45 $45
Rank 1 1
*Fleming remains, in our opinion, an extremely well-run company with strong
growth prospects, and we believe last weeks drop in
price represents an extraordinary good buying opportunity. Fleming is
currently trading at a 2002 P/E of 11.1 x on our estimate of
$2.55, down from 14.4 x two weeks ago. We re-iterate our 1-Strong Buy
rating, and our $45 price target, and we are maintaining our
FY01 EPS estimates at $1.96 and our FY02 EPS at $2.55.
*On Friday, Fleming announced that it has reached an agreement to settle the
largest of its remaining old lawsuits. We see this as a
positive, and we think the market will agree, once it understands that the
details of the settlement.
*Recent conversations with FLM management indicate that most of the glitches
related to Kmart are being resolved smoothly and that
nothing unusual has occurred given the magnitude of the transition. We
continue to many growth opportunities with non-traditional
customers, and we expect the company to be more aggressive about going after
these opportunities now that Kmart is progressing
smoothly.

"Harvard/Enron Multimedia Cases","Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection.  

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg

Jeff, I noticed one of your questions on E Speak today concerned the disposal of waste food from the Energizer.  Coincidentally one of our companies, Custom Feeds, is negotiating with Marriott for the right to collect all of the waste food from their various corporate facilities for processing into animal feed.  This is probably a better solution than giving the food to the homeless since it may not be deemed safe for consumption by health authorities after setting out at room temperature. 

Also regarding Custom Feeds they just signed a 3 year contract to sell 95% of their capacity to a large agricultural feed wholesaler beginning with Custom Feeds first production runs.  This will put Custom Feeds ahead of the projections on which we based the investment.

project called VoteAcrossAmerica.com.  This project is designed to bring the  
democratic process into the hands of the people using TV on the web.  It is a  
campaign, candidate and voter concept that is only possible because of the  
web and its ability to stream video.  It is a perfect vehicle for Enron  
because it demonstrates what the web and video can do together that video off  
of the web cannot do - make quality broadcasting mediums accessible and to  
the masses, as viewers AND programmers.  I am a webcaster who has ""The  
Official Webcast from the Chicago Stock Exchange Floor"".  We are TV on the  
web, financial newscasts 3 times daily.  You can view the quality of our  
webcast at http://www.itsaboutfinance.com.  Our voter project is an   
opportunity for Enron to establish a substantive presence deep into local  
communities via local issues and politicians; and then to expand that  
presence to other broadcasting opportunities.  I am coming to Enron because I  
know that you understand innovation and the opportunities that broadband has  
over traditional broadcasting outlets; as well as its unique personal (up  
close) and interactive nature and thus enormous potential to encroach upon  
the broadcasting 'territories' of broadcast, cable and satellite TV.  I hope  
that you are interesting in discussing this opportunity.  Thank you for your  
time. .. Carol Davis.

'Tonight Show' pokes fun at power crisis 
 
By Fred Shuster
Staff Writer 
 
BURBANK -- Jay Leno pulled the plug on his late-night chat show Thursday, doing his part for the state's energy crisis, but viewers weren't left in the dark. 
Flashlights, mining helmets and multicolor glow sticks helped to illuminate the set for the show dubbed a one-time-only ""The Tonight Show Unplugged,"" which Leno said saved enough electricity to light a house for a month. 
 [IMAGE] 	
 The ""unplugged"" edition of ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" pokes fun at the California power crisis(Reed Saxon / A.P.) 	


Call it NBC's ""Can't See TV."" 
""This is not some cheap rating ploy. ... If this works, they're gonna make us do this every night,"" Leno joked as part of his opening monologue. 
The nationally broadcast show, featuring a comic interlude with California Gov. Gray Davis, utilized just a small amount of electricity to run the cameras, Leno said before the show began. 
Actually, in Burbank, where the taping took place at NBC Studios, the city owns the power company and residents and businesses have not been hit by rolling blackouts as in other areas. The city made $5 million in profit in May after racking up $60 million in excess power sales. 
But Leno said not using studio lights, TV monitors, amplifiers and other power sources Thursday saved enough electricity to light a four-bedroom house for a month. 
Members of the house band wore miner's helmets, with group leader Kevin Eubanks strumming an acoustic guitar rather than his regular electric instrument. 
The stage was lit by candles, torches and flashlight beams trained on Leno. Members of the studio audience used the gear to help brighten the set. 
""This is real goofy,"" Leno said before taping got under way. ""We'll see what happens."" Guests included Arsenio Hall, Gilbert Gottfried, a trainer of nocturnal animals and a Hawaiian fire dancer -- and a brief visit from the governor. 
Exuding whatever is the direct opposite of charisma, Davis had a brief exchange with Leno, drawing laughs with the line, ""This is the first time Gray Davis and (the word) electricity have ever appeared in the same sentence."" 
Leno's staff wore glasses with small lights attached and audience prompter Bob Perlow held a hand-scrawled applause sign aloft throughout the show instead of switching on the usual electric model. 
While there was little energy in play, there was no shortage of laughs. 
Leno joked that President George W. Bush told Davis not to worry because, ""I've been operating in the dark for years."" 
Those in the studio said Leno's nocturnal transmission added excitement to the program. 
""It was cool,"" said Lillie Harrell, 17, a tourist from Hammond, La. ""The crowd got really involved. I guess it shows you don't really need all those lights."" 
Added Jose Tano, 21, a Burbank resident and student at the University of California, Los Angeles, ""It was a good idea and a great way to make a point."" 
The local power company might not have made out very well, but the studio audience didn't end up empty-handed. Each received a fluorescent lantern and pack of batteries as they left the studio.

"Referred By Jeff Spar (McK - NY)","Dear Jeffrey,

I am contacting you at the suggestion of my brother Jeff Spar, Chief
Information Officer of Reader's Digest and formerly of McKinsey [NYO 1990-
1999].

I am the CEO of a Houston based Microsoft technology consultancy
called ESX Engineering. ESX has strong capabilities in software
development, IT infrastructure and creative services. We have exceptional
capability in Mobile/Wireless and Web based workflow application
development. We also have tremendous domain experience in healthcare
solutions.

As a small company CEO I am always looking for new opportunities to meet
individuals whose firms may have need of our services. I would appreciate
the opportunity to meet and introduce myself and ESX. If appropriate we
could explore any potential opportunities between your firm and ESX, or
perhaps you could provide a further referral.

Sincerely Yours,

Steve Spar


PS - ESX was recently featured in the Growth Strategies section of the

"Online application issues","Jeff,

I have been researching Enron and understand some of the difficulties with
running global applications.
Many companies have problems with database replication over a wide area
network.  Traditional database replication is great for local area
replication within one data center.  Once you scale to multiple data
centers, traditional replication is unreliable, complicated to set up and
manage, and very expensive.

Zembu's software was designed to address this exact problem.  Our data
replication and synchronization solution can be used with 2 to n
geographically dispersed data centers.  Zembu also alleviates problems with:

-Global application performance
-Real time data sharing among multiple data centers
-24/7/365 application availability
-Cost effective scaling

Zembu can be used for unique log on applications, internal and/or external
applications.

I like to talk with someone at Enron to see if using Zembu as part of your
e-infrastructure and architecture would be beneficial to you.  We can
determine this quickly via a brief conference call.  Who should I speak
with?

Sincerely,
Fran Compagno

   ""BLAME CANADA"" - Some Thoughts on the California Energy Crisis, the FERC
            Settlement Negotiations and Wholesale Energy Companies


***""BLAME CANADA"" - Curiously Absent in the California Debate

***MOVING BACK FROM THE PRECIPICE - Will the FERC Settlement Process Prevent
Governor Davis from Leading the Industry (and the State of California) Over the
Precipice?

***CONFUSING NUMBERS

There are admittedly a lot of numbers floating out there with respect to the
California Power Crisis.  The administrative law judge (ADL) for the FERC,
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., is currently knee-deep in these numbers and allegations
as he attempts to reach a settlement between the various sides of this issue
during a compact 15-day settlement period mandated by the FERC.  The deadline
for this settlement if July 9th - if no settlement is reached, the FERC has
threatened to impose its own solution, which would most likely lead to a
protracted legal battle that could play out over several years.

California Dreaming $9 Billion - But Where Does the Number Come From?  One
thing does appear to be clear here - no one, including Judge Wagner, appears to
have any idea where this $9 billion number, which Governor Davis and his
compatriots keep quoting, comes from.  According to the information we have
obtained, the total amount of ""Estimated Wholesale Revenues Above Competitive
Market Baseline"" (pre and post Oct 2000) for the generators over which the FERC
has jurisdictional control is around $4.75 billion.  However, as has already
been pointed out many times, the FERC can only order refunds from Oct. of last
year onward due to a Federal law which requires a filing for refunds to be made
within 60 days of the purchases - the CA. ISO didn't begin appealing for
refunds until Dec. of 2000.  Therefore, looking at the Oct.-Feb. time period,
the amount involved appears to be more like $2.61 billion for generators over
which the FERC has jurisdictional control.  For all generators, the numbers
look more like $3.8 billion for the Oct.-Feb. time period and $6.8 billion for
the entire period - May 2000 through Feb. 2001.

It's worth noting that none of the generating companies know where any of these
numbers from the CA. ISO come from and what the bases of any of these
calculations are.  For now these numbers appear to be just another data point
in the negotiations, although they clearly do appear to undermine the
California's position on the $ 9 billion refund its demanding.  Judge Wagner
has already appeared to put out one data point in the negotiations, stating at
the outset that the California is owed refunds (of course, California hasn't
paid its bills yet on this issue, so calling this a refund is a bit
disingenuous) of perhaps a billion dollars or so (according to the Wall Street
Journal).  We believe that this represents one line of demarcation being set
out by the judge early on to encourage both sides in this debate.  Known
reserves, or quoted reserves, taken by generators or wholesale energy companies
involved total more than $1 billion, and of course that doesn't include
everyone since there are a number of generators involved who aren't or haven't,
disclosed any information.

Reserved Amounts, Amounts Owed to Generators by CA. ISO, Alleged Overcharge
Computed by CA. ISO - No Wonder Investors Having Been Steering Clear.  Based on
our conversations with investors over the past several weeks, it appears that
many investors see good value in some of the wholesale energy companies and
independent power producers at current levels, but the problem is the political
uncertainty.  Emerging Markets political psychology has now become a part of
valuing these companies as it relates to the ""third world"" nature of the
California power system.  This is in line with what we began to warn investors
about several weeks ago with respect to this crisis, but it also could
represent an excellent buying opportunities in certain names.  We continue to
believe that somehow, someone (or something, in the case of the FERC) will
eventually lead us back from the precipice from where Governor Davis has been
taking this issue.  Alongside a potential resolution of this case through the
current settlement negotiations, strong second quarter earnings from these
companies could also provide a catalyst.

If we were to assume that the ultimate settlement figure were to be less than
this ""floated figure"" by Judge Wagner at the outset of this settlement process,
then on the face of it the generators would appear to be more than fully
reserved on this issue.  However, that assumes that a settlement can be reached
in the allotted 15 days, that is not more than $1 billion, and also assumes
that each companies established reserves, or lack of reserves, proves to be in
line (this last area being the most doubtful).  As an example, Enron (ENE -
Attractive Rated) has, according to the company, booked reserves on this issue
of $435 million while it claims to be owed $570 million by the CA. ISO.
However, the alleged overcharge by Enron by the CA. ISO is only $39 million.
Enron, it would appear from these numbers, could stand to make a windfall from
these settlement negotiations.  On the other hand, Reliant (REI - Not Rated)
appears to have reserved just $39 million but claims to be owed $358 million by
the CA. ISO.  The CA. ISO, however, appears to be claiming that REI overcharged
it by $750 million, although realistically the figure here we should focus on
is $378 million based on the Oct, 2000 - Feb., 2001 time period.  The problem
is of course, no one knows how the CA. ISO's figures were calculated, let along
Governor Davis has lifted his $9 billion figure from.

Breaking Down the Numbers. In the enclosed excel file we have broken down
information (where available) for the various wholesale energy companies and
independent power producers with respect to alleged overcharge by the CA. ISO,
the reported EBIT for these companies in fiscal year 2000, the amount that
these companies have claimed is owed them by the CA. ISO and the approximate
reserves each of these companies has taken with respect to this issue.  In many
cases, these are obviously not hard data points since they can't be readily
located in filings by these companies with the SEC.  Some of the figures come
from various public statements made by the heads of these companies, or are
lifted from articles where they were attributed to someone at these companies.

The Camouflaged Canadians.  It has been interesting to read through articles
regarding the California Power crisis, and even to watch ""supposedly"" well-
researched documentaries that are expected to present a ""balanced"" thorough
account of what has been and what continues to happen in California and
throughout the Western United States.  This is a complicated subject, a
complicated chain of events which has led to this crisis, but it is still
stunning at times to see major issues missed by the press, or ignored by the
California Governor's office, in assessing this issue.  More often than not,
the hydroelectric system in the Pacific Northwest and the integral role it
plays in supplying California power during the summer doesn't get adequate
attention, nor does the hydro system of our neighbors up north.  You want to
know who has made the most money yet off the California Power Crisis - look
north.  For obvious political and legal reasons, Governor Davis in California
has pointed the finger solely and continually at Houston, Texas.  However,
perhaps Governor Davis and/or the rest of California should perhaps focus some
attention on Canada if they want to determine who gained the most from this
crisis.  Through the first three-quarters of 2000, BC Hydro's net income
increased by close to $860 million on a y/y basis.  According to info we have
seen related to the California ISO calculations regarding potential
overcharges, that appears to be the single largest amount of money made from
the California Energy Crisis (we have assumed for now in this statement that
California would deem all of the increase in profit on a y/y basis to be
illegally gained, which is admittedly an overstatement, but then again these
figures for BC Hydro don't include fourth quarter results for 2000 whereas the
Ca. ISO comparison figures do).   Fourth quarter results for BC Hydro are not
expected to be reported until somewhere on July 9-11, but we would expect the
fourth quarter to be a ""whopping number"".  The attached excel sheet provides
more data, but the quarterly net incomes for BC Hydro and % y/y increases were
as follows; 1Q00 - $306 million, up 147% y/y; 2Q00 - $658 million, up 306% y/y;
3Q00 - $362 million, up 100% y/y; 4Q00 - ?.

According to the information we have been able to find, it looks as if BC Hydro
announced two rebates to their Canadian customers during 2000 which look to
total around $1.5 Billion.  Canadians don't vote in California's 2002
Gubernatorial race, nor will they be allowed to vote in the 2004 Presidential
Election in this country.  And although we're not lawyers, it seems that is
would be more than a little difficult for Governor Davis to sue Canadians and
their ratepayers for a return of these rebates.  Perhaps we quibble, but it
would appear to be selective prosecution on the part of the California
politicians.  But then again, perhaps California's attorney general has a ""jail
partner"" in mind as well for the head of BC Hydro.

"Home Depot and more","I just wanted to pass you a note on these guys, since we had you call Bob Nardelli a couple of months ago to see what we could get going. Home Depot issued and RFQ and we responded with a non-conforming bid. We have, however, been chosen to exclusively negotiate with them (beat out Reliant and TXU) for their energy spend west of the Mississippi. We are focusing on a spend of about $50mm a year. We are also looking to help them with some of their problems in California, They entered into a number of 1-2 year deals with third party providers that were brokered for them by SRI and as they expire, they don't want to go back to the utilities.

Just wanted to let you know that we are making progress, and at the right time I may ask you to make another call to Nardelli.



New Subjects;

- I also have hooked up with Liz Flynn at Chase. She is an executive vice president and reports directly to Shapiro. She will look to me as the senior Enron contact for our deal and is aware and supportive of the corrective actions we are taking as well as the need for some restructuring. 

- As you know, we have recently closed 3 deals with Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties. We did 5 year deals for their Chicago, NY and Boston based properties. We are in the midst of looking at other regions as well as negotiating a term sheet for an off-balance sheet partnership that would perform DSM and look at Distributed Generation opportunities at their properties. I think it would be great to have you call Sam and say how great it is that we were able to begin doing business together. I will send sheri a note with his number and some deal details if that is acceptible to you.

Thanks,
Jeremy

THE FINAL WORD 
CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF AN ENORmous stupidity crisis. Californians have been sitting in the dark because ... they didn't turn the lights on.
They say they're short of electricity. Yes, they are. Between 1988 and 1998, California's electricity consumption increased by 15 percent. Meanwhile California's capacity to generate electricity shrank by five percent, even as the state hesitated to build new power lines to tap into neighboring states' power supplies. 
Californians didn't want dams across their rivers, derricks on their ocean, power lines across their borders, or fossil fuel smoke in their sky. These might interfere with all the smart things Californians do, such as hang-glide. California was going to rely on ""negawatts"" - dramatic power conservation. (But California regulators put price controls on electricity that lowered prices, and even Californians weren't dumb enough to skip a bargain.) And California was going to rely on alternative power generation. With all the puffery from Silicon Valley dot.com start-ups, wind farms wouldn't be a problem. And doesn't Gwyneth Paltrow's star shine bright enough to operate a solar panel? But it turns out that alternative power generation is an alternative, mostly, to generating power. 
Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost. Let them make their crudites with crab grass. President Bush was wrong to grant an extension of executive orders requiring out-of-state utilities to supply power to California. And everyone is wrong to listen to Californians whine about electricity deregulation. 
There never was any deregulation. The California Public Utilities Commission merely changed its regulations, which apparently weren't stupid enough to meet Golden State standards. Under California's 1996 re-regulation plan, electric companies sold their generating plants and became distributors. They were required to buy their power on the wholesale spot market and forbidden to enter into any long-term power supply contracts. Retail electricity prices were lowered by 10 percent and frozen at the new rate until March 2002. 
This is like requiring A&P to sell you porterhouse at $2 a pound, no matter what the price of beef on the hoof. Imagine how many steaks there would be, and how many supermarkets. Go to one of those boarded-up grocery stores, purchase a phantom T-bone, screw it into a ceiling fixture, and try to light your house. You're in California. 
Californians devised a system of electricity sales that ignored every dimension of the free market. (Interesting that the ""Information Economy"" is centered in a place that's immune to information.) The free market is a yardstick, and Californians got smacked with it. Mideast oil jitters, cold weather, natural gas price spikes, and the plain unpredictable freedom of the free market caused wholesale electricity costs to rise and California utilities to go $12 billion into the red. 
California's governor Gray Davis responded with the full force of bikini beach brain. In a January 8 speech to the state legislature, Davis proposed creating a state agency to buy generating plants and build new ones. He threatened to expropriate power generators and transmission grids. He called for laws to allow criminal prosecution of wholesale suppliers who withheld electricity from California markets. And he said the state's universities and community colleges would build co-generating plants and become energy independent. (With gas produced by the cafeteria food?) Gray Davis sounded like Joseph Stalin with the IQ of Keanu Reeves. ""Everyone should understand that there are other, more drastic measures that I am prepared to take if I have to,"" Davis declaimed. 
""Take"" is the key word. Grabby Californians tried to regulate themselves into some cheap electricity. Hoggish California power companies went along because the stateimposed retail price ceiling was also a retail price floor. According to the Los Angeles Times, during the first 28 months of the scheme, Pacific Gas and Electric and California Edison made $20 billion from the legally required mark-up between wholesale and retail electric prices. 
Californians want to snatch that money back. ""Consumer advocates around California... said it did not matter that the utilities were returning investments to their shareholders,"" reported the January 31 Washington Post. ""They took the money and ran,"" said state senator John Burton. As opposed to Californians, who took the electricity and roller-bladed? Now the juice and the jack are both gone, and the California legislature has had to pass a bill authorizing $10 billion to try to clean up the mess. 
But the Californians could still pull a scam. The bill mandates long-term power contracts at rates that are way above what future prices should be. The hope, one guesses, is that Congress, or the President, or somebody will let the state skip out on those contracts once the costs are lower. 
It would be wrong to call Californians stupid. They're sleazy, too.

"Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request","I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

   Thursday, June 14,  2001 Issue 30   EDITORIAL  Putting the  brakes on Regulations   The past few weeks have brought home the reality of  just what sort of environment energy companies are working in.  For all the talk about deregulation across the globe, it's  become increasingly apparent that governments aren't quite  willing to give up their control over energy supply and  distribution.    In Europe, EDF's expansion plans have been put on the hot  seat by various governments not too thrilled about the idea of  the French company becoming a major player in their backyards.  Enron's recent problems in India only serve to highlight that  while Asia remains an important place for investment,  governmental red tape remains a major impediment. The  Brazilian energy crisis has brought the Brazilian government  back into the mix with a vengeance. And in the US, California  is having a fine time going after a number of energy companies  on charges of price fixing. It would seem that the energy  companies can't catch a break wherever they term (even mother  nature seems to be having fun at their expense with the recent  flooding in Houston with my namesake Tropical Storm Allison).    It's not all doom and gloom however. Record profits and  investment in the energy stocks only go to show that the  energy industry is a resilient lot.    --Allison Robertshaw, Editor      CASE STUDY  Latin America and the Energy  Economy  The dawn of the 21st  Century signals a shift in Latin America to an ""Energy  Economy"". However, the pathway to the new economy is plagued  with potholes in the form of political unrest, decades of poor  planning, hydroelectric projects on the verge of drying up, on  again-off again deregulation efforts, and impending gloom in  some power sectors.  In spite of many headlines  pronouncing doom and gloom there are many bright spots on  Latin America's energy horizon. As the old saying goes ""there  are many roses among the thorns"". Not the least of those roses  is the sector's abundant oil and gas reserves, estimated at  some 137 billion bbl... Click here for Full Story       FOCUS  The Sun Rises On Alternative  Energy  The winds of change are  blowing in the energy sector, particularly in the field of  renewable energy. Renewables, especially solar are set to grow  dramatically over the near term as the industry comes to grips  with the depletion of fossil fuels and the power shortages  plaguing much of the globe.  The renewable energy  sector is expected to grow as much as 28.5% per year over the  next five years according to reliable sources. It should be  noted however, that renewables are not expected to be a major  threat to conventional oil and gas as most of the world and  virtually all of the industrialized... Click here for Full Story        INSIGHT  Preparing for the (Uncertain)  Future  Technological advances,  along with increased merger activity, clearly have increased  the complexity of the energy industry dramatically during the  past decade. Complicating the scenario is the fact that energy  managers are more accountable to shareholders and shareholder  value than ever. The change has been tremendous. In upstream  E&P, for example, the concept of the customer, much less  shareholder value, didn't exist five years ago. Toward this  end, a company's ability to present itself in a good light is  paramount; to do so requires a reasonable ability to predict  company performance in the near  future.

"Peer Group Mapping","On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding ""Peer Group Mapping"".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

"Portal","Steve Kean and I talked last week and ENW agreed to take Tony Mends and his team into ENW under Mark Pickering.

Mark and Tony  are working on project scope and cost for single sign on and/or an enterprise portal.

I understand that this concept was approved by the policy committee months ago, but Mark and I needed to take some time and effort to review the problem, determine resources, etc.

We will get with Greg W. in a few weeks with a project scope.

Thanks.

"Floor meeting question","Dear Jeff,

I have been an employee of EBS for just about one year.
I relocated from New York City, where I had lived and worked all of my life. The reason I made the move to Enron and Houston was the ""opportunity and growth"" that EBS was going to provide. I sold my home, left my job at AT&T of 18 years and uprooted my family and bought a home in Houston.
I enjoyed my various jobs at EBS very much and felt as though I have made a strong contribution to EBS.
Yet, I have been told that my position is no longer needed and have been placed in the redeployment program. I have had no opportunities presented to me within Enron or EBS during the past 30 days. I have 15 days to find a job.  My family is very upset and worried.

My question is "" What is the company doing about employees that have been released and feel betrayed?'

"Full-Time Analyst Orientation - Happy Hour","
On Monday July 16, more than 125 new full-time Analysts (including Tax and Global Technology) will be starting their careers at Enron.  Attached is a schedule of Orientation Topics, as well as an invitation to welcome these Analysts at a Happy Hour Monday evening.  It would be great if you could stop by, even for just a few minutes, to welcome them to the company.  For your convenience, the Happy Hour is at Farrago, which is less than 6 blocks from the Enron Building.   

Members of the Program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is an area that we can improve on, so your participation in events like this very important.

"Dabhol Project","
Dear Jeff:
 
We met at the World Economic Forum several weeks ago,  discussing Enron's interest in emissions trading, both SO2 and eventually CO2, a  subject in which I am engaged with other energy firms. I didn't get a chance to  mention that I've followed Indian energy since my posting as economic counselor  at the Delhi embassy in the mid-90's; I knew Joe Sutton quite well, as well as  many of your other folks. 
 
The news today about all the political maneuvering in regard  to Dabhol reminded me that I had wanted to offer my sympathetic and reasonably  knowledgeable support as you and your team cope with the issues, including  conciliation and a possible renegotiation. You have no scarcity of people on  this thorny subject, but I do have both a decade's perspective and excellent  current access to decisionmakers out there.
 
Regards

"Redeployment/Medical Questions","Dear Messrs. Lay & Skilling:

I am writing to you in hopes that you can assist me in clarifying Enron's Benefits Policy in regards to my medical situation and redeployment from EBS.   I have been given inconsistent information concerning how the starting date of my redeployment coordinates with an existing injury that I have - an injury that I incurred while on the job, here at Enron.

I incurred that injury in April of 2000 in a fall down a flight of stairs on the 50th floor.  I attempted, with the advice and help of my doctors, to rehabilitate the injury (for almost 10 months) without surgery.  During the first quarter of this year, it became apparent that individual rehabilitation was not working and that surgery on my foot would be necessary.  In May of this year I underwent surgery and subsequently took five weeks of short-term disability, before returning to work.  I continue to have problems associated with that injury and have been advised that additional surgery may be necessary.

In July ,2001 I met with Mary Kay Manning, EBS HR representative and inquired what my options would be regarding my injury  if I should become part of the redeployment effort within EBS.  I was advised that the Company was interested in seeing me 100% healthy and I should take care of myself.  I was told that if I could get a letter from my Doctor on that same day stating that I needed to be off from work that I would be eligible for short term disability, and that my redeployment would begin upon my return.   (I tried to call my Doctor that afternoon to get a letter only to be told he was leaving for vacation and could not be reached).

The next day, my formal redeployment was communicated to me by Marla Barnard, VP of EBS HR, I was informed that the offer extended to me the day before by Mary Kay was not an option at all.  (I had a plexiglass boot cast still on my leg from the surgery, and as I sat there listening to Marla explain about redeployment, her comment  about rehabilitation to me was "" you are walking around now can't you rehabilitate and work at the same time) and the start date of my redeployment would be unaffected by my injury. At this point, I felt this was my problem and that I would have to deal with it on my own 

Approximately two weeks later, I received a call from Pam Wilson, EBS, HR representative requesting a meeting.  In this meeting  it was communicated to me that I had a couple of different options to think about to take off for rehabilitation.  One being that I could take 2 months of unpaid leave to rehabilitate my injury and the other option being that I could use my accrued vacation time to rehabilitate.  I was advised that upon my return from either of those options, that my redeployment period would begin at that time. Pam also mentioned the letter from my doctor, which at this point I had not received. 

On Tuesday, July 31st I sent an e-mail to Pam advising her that I would like to take 5 weeks of my vacation for rehabilitation.  Later on in the day at a 4:30 p.m. meeting with Pam, Pam informed me that after meeting with Legal  that neither of these options were available and that my redeployment period would begin on August 1, 2001.

I know our HR people mean well, and are trained to handle all types of situations. However, these are the facts presented to me and I would think, that in a situation as serious as this is, that anything out of the ordinary was researched and agreed upon before relaying any information to an employee.

I am a 28- year employee with Enron, who before this injury had never taken short or long-term disability, as well as no maternity leave, and have had no issues regarding my off-duty time.  My most recent performance ranking in my peer group was a one.

Having said all of this, I acknowledge that these are challenging times for certain parts of the Compamy and fully realize that many necessary and sometimes painful business decisions are having to be made.   I would agree that there are times that corporations cannot act in ways that are totally ""fair"".  I  also feel on the other hand there are exceptions to be made regarding unique situations.

I am prepared to furnish as much documentation that is available from my Doctor regarding the exact status of this injury.   I would like to be allowed to take time off for rehabilitiation, in hopes of  having the end result that a second surgery will not be necessary.  Upon my return, if business conditions continue to require my redeployment, then I am fully accepting of that situation.  I will readily begin my redeployment period at that point and be subject to the same 45 day conditions that now apply.

Enron is a great company and I  would love to stay employed here.  If that is not the case, I hope that when I begin my job search elsewhere, I will be able to move forward with complete recovery from this injury.   

Thank you 
Bobbie Power

"A new idea for Enron to increase public exposure","Mr. Skilling, by studying Enron I've concluded that you, its driving force, are an adventurer at heart, one who loves new ideas, discovering and exploring new worlds of thought, and taking the untried path rather than the proven, overly-traveled one.  That is why I am reaching out to you personally.
As you know, the world is now one huge marketplace uniting many different cultures, attitudes and beliefs.  Never before in the history of the world has there been a greater need for people to embrace diversities with an understanding that our differences can work together to produce profound advantages for all if only we will learn the art of tolerance, acceptance and understanding.  And what company is better qualified to carry this message than the culturally-diverse and wildly-successful workforce of Enron?
I would like to work with Enron in a public relations capacity, traveling throughout the nation and abroad, educating the public about the dangers of intolerant attitudes and sharing the success story of Enron as a lesson in the value of unity.
May I meet with you briefly to discuss my idea, which I am confident will not only improve the lives of those hearing and receiving the message, but will also serve as an excellent investment of public relations dollars for Enron?
I may be reached by telephone at 281-443-2446 or by e-mail at bnreine@yahoo.com .   I hope to hear from you very soon.
Thank you,

University of California, California State University and Enron Reach Settlement Agreement 

ATTENTION: State, Business editors 

OAKLAND, Calif., July 11 (AScribe News) -- The University of California, California State University and Enron Energy Services announced today a settlement agreement that will extend their contract for two years and return the two university systems to direct access service from Enron.

As part of the agreement, UC and the CSU will drop their lawsuit against Enron and Enron will dismiss its appeal. The two university systems had brought suit in federal court seeking to retain their status as direct access Enron customers after Enron had resourced their power procurement to the Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas&Electric utility companies.

""We are delighted that our negotiations with Enron have ended with retention of the two university systems as direct access Enron customers,"" said Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance.

""The California State University is pleased that we have been able to resolve our differences with Enron and retain our direct access status,"" said Richard P. West, CSU executive vice chancellor and chief financial officer. ""This agreement means considerable savings for the universities and allows us to continue with our energy conservation efforts.""

""Enron has always been a strong advocate of the benefits of direct access, and we are pleased to be able to extend our contract for two years with UC/CSU,"" said Marty Sunde, vice chairman, Enron Energy Services.

""Separately, with the potential elimination of direct access for California customers, Enron is once again directly serving its commercial customers in California, including UC and CSU. As more and more customers in California see the importance of managing their price risk in power markets, commercial energy users have increased interest in our product offerings.""

The current four-year contract with Enron is scheduled to end on March 31, 2002. The two-year extension, approved in principle, would continue the two university systems as direct access Enron customers until March 31, 2004.

Enron and the universities will negotiate price and other terms of the extension between now and Dec. 1, 2001. Both parties have the right to terminate the extension if an agreement is not reached by Dec. 1.

The agreement covers all UC campuses and the UC Office of the President, with the exception of UCLA and UC Riverside, which have agreements with their local municipalities. All CSU campuses, except Los Angeles, Northridge, Sacramento and Stanislaus, are part of the Enron contract, as is the CSU Office of the Chancellor.

Together, UC and CSU rank as the largest single user of electricity in California. UC's systemwide peak load is 332 megawatts, and CSU's is 117 megawatts. One megawatt powers approximately 1,000 homes.

"Organizational changes","
We are pleased to announce the following organizational changes:

Enron Global Assets and Services

In order to increase senior management focus on our international businesses, we are creating a new business unit, Enron Global Assets and Services (EGAS).  EGAS will be led by Kevin Hannon, Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Hughes, Chief Operating Officer.  Kevin will report to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.  With the exception of the Wessex Water Company (which will remain in the Enron Transportation Services organization) and Enron India (discussed below), EGAS will include all of the assets and activities of the former Enron Global Assets group and the Azurix organization.  EGAS will include Enron's assets and merchant activities in South America.  In order to ensure continuity in the management of our South American merchant business, John Lavorato will remain responsible for those merchant activities.  John will report to Kevin Hannon with respect to the South American merchant business, and will continue to report to the Enron Wholesale Services Office of the Chairman for all other activities in his role as Chief Executive Officer of Enron Americas.

Enron India

Enron's significant interests in India are commanding increased attention from Enron's senior management.  We are pleased to announce that Rebecca McDonald will focus exclusively on Enron's business in India, as Chief Executive Officer of Enron India, reporting to the Enron Corp. Office of the Chairman.

Enron Broadband Services

With Kevin's departure from Enron Broadband Services (EBS), we are also making a number of changes in the EBS organization.  Jim Fallon will now be President and Chief Operating Officer of EBS.  Paul Racicot, Marcello Romano and Fred Cohagan will maintain their EBS risk management activities within their respective regions.  Dave Cox will continue as Chief Commercial Officer of EBS and will also join Ken Rice and Jim Fallon in the EBS Office of the Chairman.  Finally, Rick Fehl will continue as Vice President of Network Engineering and Chief Network Officer but will now report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.


Enron Principal Investments

In order to better develop and manage equity investment opportunities related to Enron's core businesses, we are combining the existing investment groups in ENA, EBS, Enron Investment Partners and the Enron Special Asset Group into a single unit, Enron Principal Investments.  Enron Principal Investments will work with all Enron business units to identify, execute, and manage equity investments that leverage Enron's unique and proprietary knowledge.  These investments may be in the form of venture capital, leveraged buy-outs, traditional private equity and distressed debt positions.  This new business unit will be headed by Kevin Garland, Managing Director, and will report to an investment committee consisting of Dave Delainey, Ken Rice, and Greg Whalley. 

Enron Corporate Development

In order to improve coordination of Enron's corporate development activities, we are consolidating these activities under Andy Fastow, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Jeff Donahue, Managing Director of Corporate Development for EBS will now head Corporate Development across Enron.  Corporate Development leaders in the business units will have a dual reporting relationship to their business units and to Jeff.

One of Enron's most compelling challenges is the sale of certain assets or businesses that are no longer core operations.  Mark Metts, Executive Vice President of Enron Corp., will head up a new Special Projects group to specifically focus on the completion of some of these more challenging transactions.  

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their new responsibilities.

Texas energy exec says, 'I told you'
POWER CRISIS 
?  Enron's Skilling gets pied before his speech blaming lawmakers, but says he understands Californians' anger 
By Rick Jurgens
TIMES STAFF WRITER



SAN FRANCISCO -- A Texas energy executive who said his warnings were ignored by regulators who restructured California's electricity industry came to the Bay Area on Thursday to say, in effect, ""I told you so."" 
Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., said that California wouldn't be in its current mess if regulators had followed his advice in 1994 and 1995. 
Regulators erred by forcing wholesale electricity transactions into the spot market so that deals could more easily be monitored, Skilling said in a speech to about 100 people at the Commonwealth Club of California. ""They created a flawed marketplace in the name of regulatory expediency."" 
Enron is a broker that buys and sells contracts to deliver power. Such bilateral transactions shouldn't have been banned, Skilling said. 
Skilling said that's what he said six years ago. 
""I probably made a pest of myself (in the restructuring hearings called by regulators) because I told them they were doing it wrong,"" he said. ""They finally told me to keep quiet."" 
On Thursday night, it was Skilling's turn to be pestered. A woman threw a chocolate pie into his face before the event began. Police said Francine Cavanaugh of Oakland was arrested on suspicion of battery and released. 
Skilling tried to ignore protesters but said he understood why Californians, facing blackouts and rising power costs, were angry. He even had kind words for Gov. Gray Davis, who, he said, ""was dealt a very difficult hand."" 
Skilling became Enron's chief executive in February, replacing company founder Kenneth Lay, an early proponent of electricity deregulation who is close to President Bush. 
Enron, a global energy giant with roots in the natural gas industry, owns some power plants, but its influence in the electricity industry reflects the rapid growth of its energy trading operation. 
Enron's only California generators are small wind facilities. However, the company has developed power plants. Enron initiated two 750-megawatt projects that were sold to Calpine Corp., including a Pittsburg plant due to go online next month. Enron has announced plans to seek regulators' approval for a 750-megawatt power plant in Roseville in Placer County. 
During the first three months of 2001, Enron posted a huge jump in revenue, to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion a year ago, but a much smaller gain in net income, to $425 million from $338 million. Skilling himself cashed an $850,000 paycheck and got a $5.6 million bonus last year. 
But the energy crisis has taken its toll on Enron's stock price and on Skilling, who owned or held options to buy 1.9 million shares of Enron common stock at the time of the company's February proxy filing. At Thursday's closing price of $44.05 a share, the stock was down more than 50 percent from its 52-week high of $90.75 in August. 
That proved that Enron wasn't the villain in California, Skilling said. ""This thing in California has been bad for everybody,"" he said. ""If we had anything to do with this, we're the stupidest people in the world.""

"Moved, New, and Improved!","

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.

"I would like to help you succeed with this challenge.","
Jeff
 
The attached  ""Rough & Tumble"" is an electronic clipping service targeted at California  politicos and policy wonks.  It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago.  Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay.  It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the  way.  
 
However, it  is the long-term challenge that draws my attention.  From my research  to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity  for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than it's abilities with public policy information.  
 
Ken Lay,  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge.  Like  Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the ""man on the street"" to understand  precisely what Enron does.  However, because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small  businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine  in it's worst nightmares.
 
From my  perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy.  Going  forward, these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enron.
 
I would like  to help you succeed with this challenge.  I look forward to our  discussions.

Updated Friday, May 25, 2001 8:54 Pacific Time        

Companies pushed up price of power -- After months of investigation,  state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have  deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices. Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5/25/01 
Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5/25/01 
Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. ""Tell me something I don't already know,"" adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. ""None of this is news to us,""  Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5/25/01 
Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5/25/01 
Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01
Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. ""The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man,"" said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. ""I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead."" Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there ""are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of"" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5/25/01 
With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5/25/01 
Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. ""The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control,"" Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. ""It would be fantastic,""  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. ""The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy."" Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. ""California is  catching up and jumping forward,"" said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein  said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize  the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of ""Forever  Young."" Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.  Kelly Zito in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 More..

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

Ashley

I suggest that a meeting with you be scheduled to discuss an alternative
severance proposal as your package does not reflect the life-threatening
illness that I contracted while working for Enron in Nicaragua nor does it
appear to take into consideration many other issues such as the difficulty
of obtaining a comparable position at my age.  Please call me today to set
up a meeting with you at a location other than the office.

"Organizational Announcement","
From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

"private equity brief","Jeff,

it's been a while since our meeting at the Portfolio Grand Slam Event in
may... but i wanted to brief you on an effort we brought to you guys viz
making a market in private equity.

originally began the conversation with Lou Pai, but since his departure
we've been engaged with ford cooper and health scheisser in the xcelerator
group.  ford's had numerous conversations with the relevant internal enron
folks.  we've helped confidentially engage some external players/experts in
the venture/private equity space.

initial progress looks promising.

all the best,
clay

"FW: Crown Energy","Oscar Wyatt and Tom Bachtell have agreed with our recommendation to hold off doing anything pending the results of the MCN/MCNIC arbitration scheduled July 23 - August 10.

They also were unaware that our convertible preferred was non-voting which effectively ruled out doing anything at the June shareholder meeting along the lines they were considering since the record date has passed.

Subject:	Crown Energy

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

"trip to Spain","Jeff:

it was great to see Rebecca and you last night. I was sorry to hear about
your water damage, but thankfully it stayed out of the house. I am
attaching some stuff about the trip to Spain, that you might find useful.
You will find quite a bit of it in your Spain guide. Furthermore, I am
going to start thinking about a diving trip to the Caribbean in November.
You need to take about five days to make it worth while ( you can't dive on
the last day, on account of nitrogen levels in your blood stream). It will
be up to you to get certified in the meantime. The way I would do it (and
actually did) is to go to the Presidente Intercontinental in Cozumel and go
to their dive shop, Scuba Doo, for a three-day course.

I am scheduled to hear from the firm about my partnership election over the
next couple of days. I'll let you know what happens, one way or another. By
the way, I put your name on a list of references, so they might have
called. If they did, many thanks for taking the time and forgive me for not
telling you in advance.

All the best,

Pedro

and have been considering several alternatives.  Could you spare a twenty

"Amber and StorageApps Acquired","In a absolutely dead tech market, two of the EBS portfolio companies announced they were being acquired today.  StorageApps is being acquired by Hewlett Packard for $350 million, and Amber Networks is being acquired by Nokia for $421 million.  If I am not mistaken, these are the 2 largest technology acquisitions of 2001 (where only a handful of acquisitions have been made in total all year).

Net gains to Enron on both of these investments (which were both made in 2000) will be small, but the acquisitions are a verification of EBS Ventures ability to pick the best telecom investments in the market (no other single investor is in both of these deals).  Steven Sheldon and Patrick Hickey deserve tremendous credit for originating and managing these investments.

Thanks,

Kevin Garland

"Crown Energy","I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

"United Way 2000 Contribution Reminder","During our United Way 2000 Campaign that was held last fall, you were kind enough to pledge a contribution to the United Way. Our records indicate that your preference was to pay by check.  If you have already paid your contribution, thank you!  If you have not, we wanted to provide you with the information that you need in order to send in your contribution.

All checks should be made out to the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast.  They can be sent interoffice mail in a confidential envelope to the attention of Zulie Flores, EB 1612.  If for some reason, you do not know the amount that you pledged, you can call Zulie at 
3-3908 and she will be able to assist you.

We had such a successful campaign last year and it was due in large part to your generosity.  Thank you for your support of this very important program - you did make a difference!

"Possible Partnering Opportunity with Enron","Dear Mr. Skilling,

Good day to you!  I believe our companies may have a fit for a possible working relationship.  My name is Gayle Johnson and I am with Working Solutions (www.workingsol.com).  We are a virtual service management company and specialize in contact center management, including:  voice, e-mail, chat, fax, and VOIP, using home-based agents.  Our virtual community of educated, experienced agents is highly scalable, providing solutions for peak demand, high spike call volumes and short notice applications.

We currently have over 11,000 agents, speaking 35 languages, who have been tested and their experience level/skill sets have been logged.  We have a different model that eliminates the benefit load, infrastructure costs, and bricks/mortar issues of a traditional contact center by using our network of agents.  We also utilize your existing technology infrastructure to keep all reporting and management functions consistent within your organization.

If you'd like to consider outsourcing customer care, tech support agents, etc., I know we have a quality, cost-effective solution for you.

At your request, I can send you a two page overview of our company.

I look forward to exploring this possibility with you.

Sincerely,
Gayle Johnson

"New Scanner","Dear Mark; With the help of my instructor I got a copy of your Turkish
article.  Can you mail me a translation as I am a little rusty with my
Turkish.  Also I am assuming that is a piece of chalk in your hand as I
assume you don't want me to give you a lecture on the dangers of smoking
cigarettes.
     The telephone number of the Comfort Suites next to Payton's is
(630)896-2800.
      I also got your E-mail with the Flight number--- thank you.  Tell
Sukran we are looking forward to meeting her next month.  We will not be at
the airport as we couldn't get close to you until you get through customs and
you will want to pick you car up then. If for some reason you would like us
there just say the word and if you do get held up at the airport give us a
call.


    Please keep us up to date on any new developments.  We are interested on
what is going on at the Istanbul law office particularly how they may effect
your position.
     Mother and I send Lots of Love and Kisses to You and Sukran.       DAD

"San Diego Invite","Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Jeff,
I seldom hear of anyone as fearless  as you.
I'm a VC.  Small $10M fund I first started 3 yrs ago.  Delivered a 15x return. That incls total money placed, so the return could  increase as our portfolio companies mature. I'm currently preparing to raise a  second fund of $60M.  Why do I write?  I'm looking at technologies in  your territory.  Could certainly use your help....likely to be beneficial  to you too.  
If you are up this way, do feel free to  call.
Best,
Petra

"FW: SMU energy roundtable","Mr. Skilling,
 
I am forwarding the following request for Enron to participate in an SMU gas conference.
 
Mr. Forrest, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Downey are very respected men in Independent Oil and Gas circles and Major Oil Company arenas with special ties to Shell Oil Company / Royal Dutch Shell.
 
I thought it best that a response be considered by the Office of The President.

Subject: SMU energy roundtable


Horace,

Hope all is well with you in the Enron transition. I had a short visit with
Mike Rosen at AAPG in Denver.

I am a Trustee with a group in Dallas called ""Institute for the Study of
Earth and Man @ SMU"" or  ISEM (other trustees include Leighton Stewart and
Marlan Downey). We have an annual energy roundtable - this years event is a
2-3 day gathering in Taos, New Mexico, September 21-22 (arrive Thursday
evening, leave on Sunday). Title of conference is ""Opportunities and
Practicalities in the North American Energy Sector - With emphasis on Gas"".

Marlan and I are part of the planning team for the roundtable - we would
like to have an Enron person attend (we limit attendance to 25) to make
short informal presentation about U.S. gas and power, including California
problems, and participate in the discussion.

Can you suggest someone - better yet, forward this email with tentative
agenda (attachment) to an Enron exec who may be interested in attending our
Roundtable. 

Mike

"Announcing Outlook Web Access for Houston Outlook Users","Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.

If you have any questions, please call:

Resolution Center at x31411 or
	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

"AT&T Talking Points for Jeff Skilling","Jeff:

Although the contract with Adventis has been terminated by D.Cox via telephone, Partha Ghosh continues to try to facilitate the AT&T - Enron relationship.  

I continue to believe that there is no reason that you can not have a direct relationship with Dave Dorman to pursue opportunities at a high level.  I have always encouraged a direct call from you to D.Dorman to find out if we can wean ourselves from Adventis.

I understand that you have a call scheduled today with D.Dorman I would like to take the opportunity to get a gut check on the previous deal if you think it is appropriate.



Talking Points:


Previous Deals Proposed

We previously proposed a transaction to establish a JV which would pursue the wholesale intermediation market for long haul bandwidth (see attached draft).

You seemed interested in our proposal but we have had difficulty in getting a follow up meeting to confirm your interest and get your thoughts on the proposal.

In the meantime, through Adventis, we proposed a different structure where AT&T would buy Enron's longhaul network and in exchange Enron would take back a take or pay (see attached draft).  In our view, it's really the same deal but instead of AT&T receiving value through an equity interest in a JV, AT&T would receive value through the take of pay.  The deal really accomplishes the same thing for us.


The Strategy Behind the Deals Proposed

EBS is really an acquisition for Enron that came with the purchase of Portland General Electric.  The communications company of PGE was going down the road of all of the other fiber over builders in the marketplace in that it intended to build out its own network.

We have repositioning that company over the last 12 - 18 months so that it fits better with the Enron business model of trading and intermediation.  Part of this process likely includes reducing of most of out long haul positions to better facilitate intermediating the long haul market as opposed to  build, own and operate in it. The deals proposed to AT&T would assist accomplish this repositioning of EBS.

Future Communications

Previously we have spent much of our time communicating to you through Adventis.  This has been a challenging process for us.  Is it possible to establish a direct high level relationship with AT&T especially at the President (D.Dorman) to CEO (J.Skilling) level.

"Visions and Values,","Mr. Lay,

My name is Jynell Scott Holliday.  I was hired to work contract at Enron (ECT) in April, 1997.  I was  contracted to work in the IT department as a Helpdesk Coordinator.  I worked very hard to prove myself and exceeded the time limit given to me to which I had to complete my project. With that I was very innovative.   I created forms to make the environment move in an efficient manner.  In January, 1999, I was hired by Enron (EES) to work at their helpdesk as a technician.  I then proved myself to be worthy and capable of completing any task provided to me.  The requirements composed of an (Service Level Agreement) SLA of first call resolution.  I did not have a problem with the requirements as noted in my evaluation.

In April 2000, the decision to transition to IBM was presented to me.  I was very pleased with working  at Enron and I was very disappointed about the transition.  I did not want to go work for IBM.  Not because IBM was a bad company but because I thought Enron was a great company.   The visions and values concept that Enron diplayed really made me feel safe and comfortable as long as I was doing my job, to which I was.  I was, also, told by a VP during the beginning of the transition  that ""If anyone did not won't to go to work for  IBM they  did not have to."" I took the statement literal.  I attempted with all my power to stay with Enron.  After trying vehemently to stay,  I was told that I did not have a choice and I had to go with IBM or  unemployment.  I still continued to find out what I could  do to get a job back at Enron.  I applied for multiple jobs and I rarely heard from anyone.  

Well, as you know, the IBM contract is gone.  I tried again to be replaced back at Enron as an employee.  I did everything I could to be rehired by Enron.    I was interviewed, however, It was unprofessionally handled.   After all this I have seen  the values  be misplaced.   I have had experience with Enron and I would like to know why it  I was not rehired.  I have never been told that I did not do a good job. The reason I am writing this letter to you  is to find out why I was not chosen to continue what I started and wha it would have taken to keep get a job at the company I had so much respect for.  Since, I was still at  Enron working on the  IBM @ Enron project, I have been a loyal, respectful and an innovative employee and  I would like to know why I  was not given the opportunity to get a job here. This really concerns me.   I know that you are not obligated to reveal this information however nothing has been communicated to me and I feel that this is something that anyone would need an answer to since my work ethics are explicable and I my records reflect that I  would have done a great job for Enron.

Sincerely,
Jynell Scott Holliday

Subject:	Best Houston Bike Shop

Dear Fellow Enron Cycling Club Members,

The Houston Press is conducting its annual ""Best of Houston"" survey.  One of the categories typically analyzed is the best area bike shop.  I would like everyone to consider submitting a vote for West U Schwinn.  Recall that the owner of West U Schwinn, Jeff Neilsen, attended and spoke at several of our pre-MS 150 cycling club meetings.  Jeff also provided free bike inspections during our MS 150 kick-off party in front of the building.  Finally, his shop offers larger discounts to Enron Cycling Club members than any other bike shop in town, both on services and supplies.

To vote, simply go to <http://houstonpress.com/bestof/2001/boh2001/poll>.  For some reason, this year ""best bike shop"" is a write-in category, so please vote on any other category you are interested in and then add the bike shop category and West U Schwinn's name at the end of the ballot (in the Best Category We Forgot box).

Thanks for reciprocating the support Jeff and his shop provided to Team Enron.

Regards,
Bill Bowes

"Leaving Enron","Jeff,

Having been here at EES for not quite two years, I've come to the realization that Enron doesn't seem to be the right place for me.  As a result, I will be leaving EES effective the end of the month.   I have enjoyed the Enron experience, but as Andy counseled me when I joined, ""Enron isn't right for everyone"" and I think that applies to me at this point of my career.

I've decided to return to my banking roots, and am mounting a job search in the Houston banking community.  With a little luck, I will find an opportunity to cover the Enron account where I can leverage off my time here. 

Finally, I want to thank you personally for the opportunity that I had here.  I wish you all the best as you and your team tackle the challenges facing Enron.  

See you soon.

Evans

"","Mr Skilling,

I would like the opportunity to talk to you at some point to discuss your vision and goals for the Broadband
Operating System (BOS), and strategic development in general in Enron/EBS. 


Since EBS is currently focused almost exclusively on short-term tactical delivery  (which it should be), I'm not 
sure how strategic efforts like the BOS fits into those goals.   Balancing these tactical vs. strategic goals is 
becoming _very_ difficult.  Indeed, because of the current customer-specific tactical deliverables, there is 
very little strategic development going on in general in EBS.  Yet I know that BOS is still a very important  
deliverable.  

I want to make sure we're doing everything we need to do to support your goals and vision for EBS.

It would _really_ help me if I could hear a little bit more about your short/med/long term goals for the BOS, 
and perhaps some of your thoughts about EBS' technology and products in general.  Then we could discuss 
ways to properly balance the tactical and strategic efforts to achieve those goals.


---


On a different topic, I understand that you are currently thinking about potential projects for the Xcelerator. 
And I understand that you are focusing on technical products and capabilities that do not overlap the current 
& past initiatives at other business units.  I think that there are many great opportunities in that approach.

I have seen a number of very interesting product concepts from various people in Enron that 
would fit that model perfectly.  And I'm sure there are many many more.   As a sample, I've attached 
a short document  listing just a few of the technology-focused ideas that I have heard about.

I also included the idea of commercializing BOS as a stand-alone product on that list.  Perhaps this is
one way that BOS could continue developing within Enron without interfering with the current tactical focus.
Obviously, EBS would still be the primary customer for BOS no matter how it is developed.

....just a thought....


Thank you for your time.

"EEO Europe:  Energy Trading in the New Economy","
Dear  Jeff:
 
Eyeforenergy  is organizing the upcoming EEO Europe:  Energy Trading in the New Economy  conference for February 21-22, 2002 in Amsterdam.  I'd like to invite you to do a keynote presentation at the event.  We think  Enron's pioneering role in Energy trading would make an ideal case study for the  event and be of great interest to our  delegates.
 
This is the third  event of the series, and the first in Europe.  Past events have pulled in  over 250 delegates and featured speakers from such companies as Shell, BP, Duke,  Aquila, the ICE, NYMEX, Calpine, Altra, Ameren, AES, New Energy, Conoco, the  FTC, Southern, TXU, and Williams among others.  As you can see our events  regularly attract the major players in the energy industry.  (you can take  a look at the line up for our US conference at www.eyeforenergy.com/usa2001 )
 
This year's  European event is going to focus on the convergence of online trading and the  deregulation of the energy market in Europe.  Presentations will be  strategic in nature addressing specific issues and how they are affecting energy  companies' trading strategies.  I've attached a copy of the draft agenda to  give you an idea of the topics we're looking to cover.  Any thoughts on the agenda, the topics, issues  we're missing, or key people you think would be important to have speak at the  conference would be most helpful.
 
To give you a bit of  background, Eyeforenergy is an on- and off-line community for the energy  industry focusing on new strategic and technological advances in the energy  industry.  To serve the community we run conferences, provide daily news, a  bi-monthly newsletter, in-depth reports, free white papers, streamed  presentations and interviews.  You can find out more information or to see  what we do, simply go to www.eyeforenergy.com    
 
Ihope you'll be able  to join us in Amsterdam and let me know if  you have any questions. I'd also  appreciate any comments you might have on our plans--we're always trying to fine  une the program to make sure  t firmly addresses the  needs of the market we're  targeting.  If there's a good time to call when you're back in the  office, please let me know.  Thanks again for your  time.
 
Best,
Allison

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

"Goldman conf. call","Over the past 2 days, David Fleischer has leveraged his ""Recommended List -  Buy"" with a significant marketing push, including a broad sales force call late Tuesday, overnight blast voicemail to clients, and a conference call for investors yesterday late morning.  

David's conference call comments were extremely positive.  Highlights of his call include:
Enron is the ""Tiger Woods of the energy industry"" - Enron remains the premium energy company
Fundamentals are excellent; ""Misperceptions"" exist and will dissipate over time. 
David believes earnings should grow 25% over the next 5 to 10 years .  Increased estimate to $1.85/share for 2001 and $2.25 for 2002.     
Telcom is the one exception, where business is developing much more slowly than previously set forth
Enron issues/noise
California - Limited risk for Enron; Enron is part of the solution. 
India - Extraordinary contractual protection. Unlikely to lose $ from Dabhol, more likely to gain. 
PG sale - Enron will sell; not a negative in the shortrun
Asset sales slow - Weak Euro is a problem; Enron is motivated - CFO newly assigned; not an overhang; pending positive
Insider sales - Much has been pursuant to l/t sales programs to manage limited windows; Jeff has terminated his program
Wholesale - An investment bank?  Enron is much, much more than trading - risk management, structured solutions;  20%+ grower over the long-term; Very effectively extending the model to other commodities
Retail - Extraordinary capabilities;  >$15/share
Telcom - Absence of good counterparties has slowed business development.  Free call option that will be a good business.  

Investor questions following David's comments tended to be from troubled/outspoken investors.   David was straightforward and effective in his responses.  David has received many 1:1 followups that indicate to him a broad range of long-term value investors appear very interested in ENE.  He is having fun!

David's call can be accessed at 1 800 615 3210, passcode 5338365.

	Kevin Hannon 06/11/01 01:22 PM 	   To: Steven J Kean/NA/Enron  cc: Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron  bcc:   Subject: Memo	


In order to provide increased focus and greater efficiency to our international activities we have formed a new business unit, Enron Emerging Market
Services (EEMS).  This new unit will be headed by Kevin Hannon acting as CEO, and Jim Hughes as COO and will report to the Enron Office of the Chairman.  The activities of this unit will consist of all those previous pursued by the former Enron Global Assets group, with the exception of those relating to Dahbol Power Corp (DPC) in India.  Rebecca McDonald will continue to manage Enron's ownership interest in DPC and will now also report directly to the Enron Office of the Chairman.  In addition, EEMS will also manage all activites formerly residing in Azurix with the exception of Wessex Water Company which will continue to report to Stan Horton, CEO Enron Transportation Services.  Lastly, while EEMS will now manage all wholesale activities in the Southern Cone, inclusive of Brazil, significant merchant activity has, and continues to occur in this region.  For this reason John Lavorato, CEO Enron Americas(does name change to North America?) will continue to oversee all energy risk management activities in Brazil during this period of transition.  We congratulate Kevin, Jim, and Rebecca on their new assignments.

"Hello - From India -[Please Read]","Respected Sirs:

This is Xafira Mendonsa, one of the nominees to your round table held on November 14, 2000. 

Just felt like writing these few lines telling you that - It was great being with you in Houston. Thanks so much for giving us the chance to work for your Company in India. It is really very depressing to see things going bad, but I love and treasure Enron very much and along with Enron you will always be remembered by each one of us. I have worked for this Company for 7 long years and it has been a home for me and for my family as my husband and son also work in the same project. How I wish this project would go on and on and I could retire in the same company.  

Unfortunately things are not rosy here anymore. However, I am opted to accept new challenges and jobs across the Enron Corp. world-wide - if given an opportunity. Here in Mumbai, I have been recently promoted from an Executibe Secretary to an Administration Officer. I request you to keep me in mind and give me a chance to serve the Company anywere outside India.

Once again, I thank Enron for treating its employees so well and making us all feel important and wanted. I am proud to be associated with Enron and it is for that reason that I want to work for you till I retire.

Do consider my humble request and will be anxiously waiting for a reply. Greetings and many thanks from India.

Best regards with Blessings from the Almightly,
Xafira

"There are never enough of good people ...","Dear Jeffrey:

I came across your name in the business press. As an industry leader you are
knowledgeable about the latest trends and where the companies are heading. You
constantly meet top managers and some may be hungry for management talent
and/or require rapid change action.

What value can I bring?

I have nine years of combined experience in management, change consulting,
international marketing and business development.  Most recently, I took part
in transforming Fortune 500 companies into more active e-business players.B
 efore, in four years I have developed international markets from 0 to over 40
country coverage, 140 companies and units (mostly in Europe, but also in the
Middle East and in Asia).

I am looking for right opportunities and growth challenges.

If the organization wants to speed up their international expansion and avoid
some costly mistakes, I can bring in a successful record of developing business
and resources in country-to-country approach, balancing
think-global-and-act-local theme.

And/or

If the organization can benefit from broad range of change experience: I led
project teams of art designers and copywriters achieving national promotion
goals, led researches towards addressing relevant issues in their projects, led
consultants in delivering management change programs for major corporations,
led the creating of new customer and supplier networks globally. These were
project teams representing diverse experience, background, and management
levels.

And/or, finally

If you would like to share your insider's perspective on where the industry is
heading in exchange I can provide my insights into developing business in
Europe.

I am flexible on location and only a phone call away.


Sincerely yours

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to
speak
to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his

he must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

"TeliOn Broadband / joint venture proposition","Mr. Ken Rice
Chairman & CEO
Enron Broadband Services
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002 USA

Dear Mr. Rice:

Further to the call today, I have been referred to you by the office of Mr. Skilling.  For added background, I have had the pleasure of working with some of your US and Asian-based executives on transactions, notably Mike Gaffud in the Philippines regarding the sale of an equity interest in Subic Power, and meeting some of your board members including Mr. Ronnie Chan of Hong Kong, while working abroad in Asia. This follows a banking relationship with you all from a Bank of America stint.

I am in touch on a newly-formed entity, TeliOn Broadband, of which I am a partner.  It is an early mover, capital efficient fixed wireless integrated service provider (WISP) owning last mile applications in the focused markets we have researched and chosen.  Many of which are already in markets that Enron has presence. Attached please find the executive summary for your review.

We are in the process of our Series A launch and beta tests.  After meeting internally and given national scalability, would like to invite Enron Corporation and its affiliate, Enron Broadband Investments, to review as a potential partner for this round.  From what we understand, there seems to be some complementation to your current wireless communication interests and broadband initiatives. Supplementally, there may be a relationship to explore regarding co-location on certain tower sites. At an appropriate future point, there may be a couple of third party co-investment structures, in addition to Cisco Systems interests, for possible discussion.

Look forward to our being in touch.  We would be pleased to meet for a proper presentation to your firm.  Additional materials can be made available as needed in the form of our powerpoint overview and consolidated pro-forma from our financial model.

Finally, we would appreciate a receipt confirmation of this delivery.  Thanks for your kind attention.  Should you have questions in the interim, please feel free to contact me via below.

With Kind Regards,
ROC

"The message is spreading","Davis' criticism of Texas misdirected, report finds 
Lynda Gledhill, Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writers 
Tuesday, July 10, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/10/MN48875.DTL  
Sacramento -- Texas-based electricity generators have received the brunt of criticism from Gov. Gray Davis for gouging California during the power crisis, but financial information released yesterday shows the lion's share of the money went elsewhere. 
Companies with headquarters in Texas garnered less than 10 percent of California's multibillion-dollar energy purchases, while public and private energy companies from Canada to Georgia to California got the rest. 
The $424 million that went to Texas companies may still be more than the state should have been charged, and administration officials are attempting to get refunds from a host of companies, both in and out of Texas. 
Earlier this year, Davis lambasted the Bush administration for not acting against power firms in his home state. ""What's going on here, pure and simple, is unconscionable price-gouging by the big energy producers -- most of them, incidentally, located in Texas,"" he said in May. 
Yesterday, a spokesman for the governor broadened the verbal assault, saying the Texas firms are representative of the many other out-of-state generators who have also gouged California. 
""Anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face because they are robbing us blind,"" said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman. 
The latest financial information is contained in a report by the state Department of Water Resources detailing $7.2 billion in power purchases from Jan. 17 through the end of May. 
About $5.2 billion of that was spent on the spot market where power buys are made a day, hour or even a few minutes before the electricity is actually used. 
Because the spot purchases are made with little notice, they are the most expensive kind of power on the market. The state was forced to step in and buy the power when the credit ratings of California's major utilities dropped as the energy crisis worsened. The crisis was caused by a series of events that forced the utilities to pay more for electricity than they could recover from customers. 
The numbers released yesterday show that Texas companies weren't alone in receiving a share of the energy crisis pie. Some $1.2 billion went to Mirant, an Atlanta-based company. Mirant has refused to turn over documents subpoenaed by the state Legislature as part of its investigation into alleged market manipulation. Mirant could face contempt proceedings. 
Municipal generators have also fared well during the energy crisis. Powerex, 
a wholly owned power marketing subsidiary of Vancouver-based BC Hydro, received $1 billion from the state for spot market electricity. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which Davis said charged higher average spot market prices than some generators, received $331 million.

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

There's plenty of advice for managers floating around out there...some of it very good and some of it downright disastrous.  The trick, of course, is knowing which is which.

That's exactly what Harvard professor Chris Argyris proposes to show you in his new book, Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not.  For more details, read the book review section in the current issue of strategy+business.

In the same issue, you'll find a generous handful of other great books discussed. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action is a good example...so is Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs, by AnnaLee Saxenian.  And you won't want to miss the s+b review of The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life or Absolut: Biography of a Bottle.

Reviews of important business books are just part of the reason strategy+business is eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we're on the subject of complimentary issues, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...especially if you make arrangements now.

To make sure you continue receiving your complimentary strategy+business subscription, just click on the following link:

http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20010611151654&N=4609564.0&R=369.0

On behalf of me, and probably several people on this list, I do not
appreciate you distributing my email address in this manner.  If you have a
group of people that do want to hear from you, you should send them emails
as a bc, so no one else can see the addressees.

Having said that, please remove me from your distribution list. I don't know
how I got here in the first place.

"(no subject)","Hello Sukran and Mark!
     We sure enjoyed you E-mail on the wedding and Italy.  We are sure you
had a great time.
      Not much new here.  The Sox have made a great recovery but I am afraid
it might be a little late.  They have too many on the injury lists (4)
including Frank Thomas out for most of the rest of the season. They did take
the series from the Cubs but the Cubs have been playing over their heads and
are not as good as their record indicates.
     I have been busy getting a new microwave oven as the old one gave up
after 16 years service.  I bought a new one and have a man lined up to
install it over the weekend.  I am going back to New Kensington for my 60th
anniversary of my graduation on June 28 and 29.
      After several weeks of the coolest Spring I can remember the heat has
arrived.  Yesterday and the day  before near 100 and more expected.

"Transatlantic meetings","To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

"The Morning Market Call - Wednesday June 6th, 2001."," <<MF June 6th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Wednesday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Yesterday, we received revised numbers on first quarter productivity, which
came in at -1.2% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis. On a
year-over-year basis, productivity remains at a relatively healthy 2.5%
rate, although this is half the pace at which it was running less than one
year ago. A slowdown in productivity is not unusual during an economic
slowdown. Corporations face fixed costs, while business is declining.
Unfortunately, that is why there are layoffs. With lower corporate costs,
productivity should improve as the economy picks up steam. Tomorrow, the
market will be receiving the weekly initial jobless claims, which are
expected to remain near last week's level. Lehman Brothers' economists look
for first-time unemployment insurance filings to total 415,000 for the week
ended Saturday, June 2.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.65%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.25%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.83%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.44 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.85 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Procter & Gamble(PG) 2 - Buy A. Gillin Lefever, .212.526.5801
Morphing Into An Attack Aircraft Carrier
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $63.6 EPS 2000 N/A $2.95 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $79 - 53 EPS 2001 $3.10E $3.10E $3.11E 20.5
Mkt Cap: $90.8B EPS 2002 $3.25E $3.25E $3.27E 19.6
FY: 6/30 Price Target $69 $69
Rank 3 2
*We are upgrading PG to a Buy (2) rating based upon what we perceive as a
good trading opportunity in front of their June 15 outlook
meeting. We expect the meeting to highlight (1) more aggressive actions to
reduce PG's asset base than previously telegraphed; (2)
expect FY 02's recurring earnings growth to be confirmed at the
consensus-implied 6-8% rates and (3) expect previously stated long-term
growth targets to remain in place.
*Cost cutting /right-sizing remains the theme for the balance of the
calendar year / majority of FY 02. A very focused effort will
improve PG's competitiveness, but there is a reasonable probability PG will
exceed the previously telegraphed $400-$800 M in
incremental restructuring charges in order to further accelerate the
restructuring process.
*PG is slowly shifting its attention to sales growth but 4-6% long-term
growth is at least one fiscal year out. Maximum upside is
$72.00 absent any earnings-enhancing news.

National Service Indus(NSI) 3 - Market Perform D. Zwyer, .212.526.2008
Lowering Rating As Stock Approaches Price Target
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $25.73 EPS 2000 N/A $2.45 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $27 - 18 EPS 2001 $2.00E $2.00E $2.07E 12.9
Mkt Cap: $1.1B EPS 2002 $2.30E $2.30E $2.30E 11.2
FY: 8/31 Price Target $27 $27
Rank 1 3
*We are lowering our rating on National Service Industries' stock to 3
(Market Perform) from 1 (Strong Buy) based on valuation. The
stock has increased 37% since we initiated coverage on September 27, 2000,
outperforming a 10% drop in the S&P 500, and is near
our $27 price target. At about $26, NSI's stock trades at 13 times est.
fiscal (August) 2001 EPS of $2.00, and 11 times est. 2002 EPS
of $2.30. We do not see significant upside in the stock price from current
levels, and believe the shares will move with the market in
the near-term rather than outperform.
*We continue to expect difficult earnings comparisons for the second half of
2001, with a flattish 3Q (May) and a lower 4Q compared
with the prior year level. For the full year 2001, we expect lower earnings
in all segments: lighting, chemicals, linen rental, and
envelope. The risk to earnings going forward is a worse than expected drop
in non-residential construction impacting the company's
lighting business. Also, a drop in consumer spending would impact the linen
rental business.

Power 	D. Ford, .212.526.0836
No, The Sky is NOT Falling
*A change in investor sentiment towards the wholesale market has resulted in
a sell-off in the energy merchant stocks. We believe this
sell-off has been overdone and would recommend buying shares of Aquila,
Dynegy and Mirant.
*In our opinion, the apparent change in sentiment has been the result of
three factors: 1) a sector shift into tech stocks; 2) increased
perceived political risks on both the federal and state levels; and 3)
concerns about the potential for contracting commodity prices and
margins.
*While we do not see any catalysts that will stem this flow in the
near-term, we believe that preannouncement and upside earnings
surprises are just around the corner.
*Our favorite picks are energy merchants: Aquila, Dynegy and Mirant.


Global Crossing(GX) 2 - Buy D. Fletcher, .212.526.3375
Near-term Opportunity In Weighing Positives vs. Negatives
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $12.94 EPS 2000 N/A -$4.04 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $38 - 9 EPS 2001 -$3.25E -$3.25E -$3.17E N/A
Mkt Cap: $11.4B EPS 2002 -$3.19E -$3.19E -$3.15E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $28 $28
Rank 2 2
*With the stock approaching all time lows, we believe positives outweigh
negatives here, and stock offers good near term upside.
*While long term challenges remain, such as dependence on IRUs for
growth/funding, GX is off 24% in last two weeks, is making
good progress in Commercial and is a clear leader in the bandwidth sector.
We believe there is good near term upside. In terms of
DCF valuation, we get to $15-$20/share, even haircutting our (below
guidance) #'s by 20%.
*GX has signed >$600M in Commercial contracts year-to-date, and Comm Svcs
grew 7% seq, in Q1, and should grow 9%+ in Q2.
*The subsea market is rationalizing, and the 4 major subsea players could
become 2 over next 12 mos.
*Long-term challenges include IRU sales, and 01 guidance may prove
aggressive, though we believe that is in the stock, and we
believe the company can hit our 01 Cash Rev number of $6.71B, +30% Y-Y.

McDonald's Corp(MCD) 1 - Strong Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255
McREIT? New tax ruling could spark spec of REIT spin-off
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $29.41 EPS 2000 N/A $1.46 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $36 - 25 EPS 2001 $1.46E $1.46E $1.49E 20.1

FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*A favorable IRS tax ruling on REITs can spark speculation that MCD can
unlock value by spinning-off its multi-billion dollar real
estate portfolio. With a new CFO to be appointed, this can further fuel
speculation. Reit 1-Strong Buy
*The IRS has reversed a tax ruling on treatment of REITs; this will present
oppty's for co's with lots of real estate, like MCD, to spin-off
real estate b/c it could now be done on a tax-free basis
*In the US, MCD has about $8bil of property & equipment & earned $1.4b of
rental income in 00
*The risk is the elimination of a steady income stream. But, the value of a
REIT is the tax benefit & higher Returns to MCD; lower
MCD earnings (no rental income) would be more than offset by ownership of
the REIT & its tax-free benefits
Back-of-envelope analysis yields $270mil in value ($0.20/share) due to
shifting the rental income of owned sites under franchised
stores to non-taxable status; other benefits are likely.

Electronic Data Sys(EDS) 2 - Buy K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Addressing the Balance Sheet and Other Concerns
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $61.90 EPS 2000 N/A $2.29 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $67 - 38 EPS 2001 $2.63E $2.63E $2.64E 23.5
Mkt Cap: $29.6B EPS 2002 $2.98E $2.98E $3.00E 20.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*EDS shares have underperformed the major indices and CSC shares since
reporting strong 1Q01 results. We attribute this to some
concerns around the recent acquisitions, the need to access the public
markets to finance these deals and the increase in DSO's and the
drop in cash flow reported in 1Q01.
*Late last week we had a private call with the controller of EDS to address
the balance sheet issues. We believe that the key issue is
the volume of large deals ramping in 1H01. Receivable terms on large
outsourcing deals are often extended in the early stages of
contracts. On selected large deals, we also suspect that EDS (and perhaps
others) may be offering up-front price discounts, adding to
the cash flow requirement although average margins over the life of a
contract appear stable. We do not expect DSO's to decrease
materially until perhaps 4Q01.
*At 23 times forward estimated EPS for a 15% EPS growth rate story with high
visibility, we remain comfortable with EDS and our 2-
Buy rating.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Integrated Oil P. Cheng, .212.526.1884
Weekly U.S. Crude Oil & Refined Products Inventory Summary
*Absent any new major refinery or pipeline accidents, we expect gasoline
futures to drop to below $0.80 per gallon within the next
several weeks. In addition, gasoline inventories should continue to build on
average by about 0.5-1.0 million barrels per week over
the next two months due to strong domestic output and weak demand. We
continue to recommend an underweight position in the
independent refiners group.

Paper & Forest Products P. Ruschmeier, .212.526.9898
IRS Revenue Ruling Supports Bullish Timber Thesis
*As we indicated yesterday (6/5/01), IRS revenue ruling 2001-29 has positive
implications for the pending merger between PCL and
TGP and positive implications for a structural shift in timber ownership
from C-Corps to REITs over time. We are reiterating our
favorable ratings on companies with the greatest timberland exposure
including WY, LPX, TIN, BCC, IP, BOW, & TGP.
*Yesterday (6/5/01) we learned that the IRS reversed a 1973 revenue ruling
that prevents REITs from engaging in the active conduct
of a trade or business.
*We believe the ruling is an important first step in paving the way for
timber-rich companies to transition ownership of timber cash
flow from a C-corp. structure to a tax-advantaged REIT structure.
*We believe the ruling supports a favorable outcome to the PCL/TGP merger.

Internet Healthcare R. Rouse, .212.526.7347
MORE CRO UPSIDE - THE BIOTECHS ARE COMING !!!
*The CROs are poised to take advantage of two significant trends that we
pose are underway: 1. the much anticipated ""biotech bulge""
may be upon us sooner than expected (a long-term catalyst); and 2. this is
in addition to our previous call for efficiency gains and
margin upside given a return to normalized late-stage trial volume (a
near-term catalyst).
*Proprietary pipeline analysis and industry anecdotes lead us to the
proposition that the beginning of a wave of novel drugs is entering
clinical development. This creates bottlenecks for drug sponsors and
opportunities for service vendors. Diversified CROs (CVD,
PPDI, & QTRN) and niche providers (AAII & ARRY) could reap benefits as early
as this year while those more clinically focused
(KNDL & PRXL) could see upside by the end of next year.

Insurance/Life E. Berg, .212.526.2805
Estate Tax Reform: With New Focus Any Damage Will Be Minor
*An effort by us to quantify the impact on life insurers of the change in
the Federal estate-tax law passed last week by Congress is
leading us to affirm our 1-Strong Buy ratings on Manulife, Nationwide, and
John Hancock.
*The bottom line to our analysis: While these three life insurers and others
could lose as much as one-third of their existing estate-tax-oriented
policies and growth in new sales of estate-tax-oriented life insurance could
also slow by a third its still not a big deal. The
entire loss, between existing and new policies combined, would translate
only into about a 5 % to 10 % loss of revenues and earnings
companywide because estate planning is only a portion of their business.

*ABS is just beginning the arduous process of a turnaround, with a new CEO
that is willing and able to lead. He is evaluating every
aspect of the business, and is prepared to right size the company through
divestitures of profitable assets that have weak long-term
prospects.
*ABS reported 1Q01 EPS of $0.46, $0.01 ahead of our estimates and consensus.
Sales were in line with our estimates, but the
operating margin deteriorated by only 39 bp versus the 60 bp we had
forecast.
*We have lowered our 2Q01 estimate from $0.47 to $0.45, and our FY02
estimates from $1.96 to $1.93.
*With our new lower estimate, ABS' stock is trading at a 2001 P/E 14.4x, a
mere 1.5 multiple point discount to KR, which we rate a 1-
Strong Buy ($24.78). We think this gap is too narrow given the differences
in earnings outlook and asset quality, so we are
maintaining our 3-Market Perform rating

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation

Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

"Philippe Bibi","
We are disappointed to announce that Philippe Bibi, president and CEO of Enron Net Works, has resigned from Enron. Philippe will be joining Putnam Investments in Boston, Mass. as Chief Technology Officer.

Philippe joined Enron in 1995, as Chief Information Officer for Enron Capital & Trading, and has been a key member of the team that built Enron's IT organization, including our numerous successful e-commerce initiatives.  Philippe has been a great asset to Enron and our IT efforts.

For six years, his creativity, intelligence, and focus have benefited the company in many ways.  He will be missed.

Philippe has agreed to make himself available to assist in the transition of his responsibilities.  In the interim, all of the employees who report to Philippe will continue reporting to the Office of the Chairman for Enron Net Works. 

Please join us in thanking Philippe for his  many years of service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

I realize that Enron has already donated a substantial amount of money but I wondered if employees would be given time off during the work day to help those less fortunate.

"Xcelerator","Jeff --

Just a brief note -- I know that you are busy on a lot of different fronts.

I am wondering about your plans for Xcelerator.  David Berberian and I have interacted recently with the Xcelerator folks.  We brought them an idea that was conceived and developed in our group.  We call it the Collatorized Bandwidth Obligation (CBO) product, a structured financial product that should yield more than $100 million for Enron in its first application to Global Crossing.  The Xcelerator has decided to take on this opportunity and will be moving Mathis Conner and Peter Feltman, the two people from our group who developed the concept, into the Xcelerator team this week.

The Xcelerator group seems to have some good talent for evaluating ideas, but I got the sense that they are looking for folks with more implementation experience who can help them drive ideas into execution.  In fact, a couple of them wanted to know if David and I are available and interested in coming over to the Xcelerator.

Based on what I know about Xcelerator, David and I seem to have a good background and skill set for what the group is doing.  Clearly, we have generated and handed off a number of business opportunites within Enron that are currently being pursued by folks in EBS and ENW.  So, on the surface, the fit appears very good.

My question for you is whether it makes sense from your perspective for David and me to look into this opportunity.  I don't have any knowledge of what you might have planned for Xcelerator, so I don't want to pursue anything that might be distracting to the team.  Your feedback would be most appreciated. 

Best regards.

This is a really fun activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to visit with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you please.

Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us for a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executives in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this type of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuable, and appreciated.

If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension x54070.

Thank you,
Billy

"Monaco Grand Prix","
If you guys watched the Monaco Grand Prix this past Sunday...  perhaps you saw the fellow from the Ferrari team who went on the podium to  receive the winner's trophy from Prince Ranier?
 
That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri, who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world,  and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART ""IndyCar"" series...
 
I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment.
 
Please feel welcome to keep in touch... and to join us  for a race this summer if you wish.
 
Best to you

*Cut rating on Ivex Packaging to 3-Neutral from 2-Buy based on a 227% price
increase in the past year and a valuation that appears
quite full.
*While we acknowledge that the earnings are still somewhat depressed and
price increases plus raw material cost declines will help
the next 2 quarters, these positives appear priced in.
*Stock currently at 7.9x '01 EV / EBITDA vs pack univ at 7.4x & 20-year
sector average of 7.5x.
*We continue to like the company a lot and believe that Ivex has done an
excellent job of creating longer term shareholder value and
will continue to deliver.
*End market demand appears slightly positive but is slow, although
restructuring and aggressive cost cuts should allow further
improvement in EPS.
*We are maintaining our $18 target (7.5x '01 EV / EBITDA), and our EPS
estimates of $1.20 and $1.35 in 2001 and 02 respectively.

*With Caterpillar shares in the $50 range, they appear to be boldly
forecasting a solid snap-back in 2002 equipment demand--which is
far from certain.
*Deere shares in the low $40's are in roughly the same position although it
is easier to make a case for pent up demand in the farm
equipment sector following 3 lean years.
*It appears to be a good time to revisit out thesis and reexamine some of
the conclusions to see if they still stand up 6 months later and
if they are relevant for the next 12-18 mos.
*We remain comfortable with our neutral ratings on both Cat and Deere, buy

Rank 3 3
*Yesterday, Sun gave guidance that revs in the US were slightly below plan
with Europe and Japan the main culprits. They are now
forecasting revs to be below $3.7B with lower GMs and a small operating
loss. This is even worse than we previewed Monday. We
have lowered CQ3 revs from $3.9B to $3.5B, EPS from $0.02 to ($0.02), FY2002
revs from $18.0B to $15.9B and EPS from $0.32
to $0.17.
*Sun believes that this is not a company specific issue and that all
computer hardware vendors are having difficulties. IT demand is
significantly lower than 6 weeks ago and deterioration in the global economy
has affected sales cycles and the ability to close deals in
the pipeline.
*The macro issues in the US seem to be spreading to Europe and Asia for most
tech companies and we still have 50% of the quarter
left to do. This has been our thesis since early this year and we expect it
to get worse before it gets better. We remain cautious on the
computer hardware group.

Rank 3 3
*As we previewed on Tuesday, Altr reaffirmed Q3 guidance of revs down 15-20%
q/q and GMs of 63-64% and said nothing else.
Though we strongly believe they are tracking to the lower end of guidance we
did not expect a change in guidance given the back-end
loaded nature of Q3 and the hope that things improve.
*There were no details but given their poor August, there would not have
been much good to say. There is continued weakness in
their telecom end market as underscored by WorldCom group yesterday cutting
its cap ex for 2002 to $5.5 from $7.0B in 2001. In
the data processing end market, Sun confirmed that demand continues to
worsen and we are lowering revs by $2.1B for FY02 to
$15.9B.
*Xlnx will give their update on Sept. 10th and we expect no change in their
guidance (revs down 20-25% q/q) though things are
tracking to the higher end of their range which they should mention. Both
stocks remain expensive.
Oil & Gas T. Driscoll, .212.526.3557
Exploration & Production: Falling gas prices could hurt E&P's
*We continue to remain cautious about the outlook for natural prices (as
well as E&P share prices) because of growing natural gas
supply combined with weak natural gas demand. We believe that the average
E&P stock fairly discounts a long-term natural gas
price forecast of about $3/MMBtu - but with the September gas contract
falling as much as $0.165 to $2.25/MMBtu yesterday we
believe that near-term stock price performance is likely to be negative.
Investors are prepared for short-term natural gas price
weakness - however if the price gas-price weakness is sustained we believe
that E&P shares will be under increased pressure.

Rank 2 2
*We are reiterating our 2-Buy rating and $70 price target. VeriSign remains
our top large cap idea and we would be aggressive buyers
at current levels.
*Recent pullback below $40 (40x FY02 EPS) provides great entry point to
establish positions.
*VeriSign remains one of a few companies able to provide investors with
revenue and EPS visibility due to its unique services model
and deferred revenue model. A major catalyst going forward for earnings
growth is our expectation of expanding operating margins
from 14.6% to over 30% by 2003.
*We believe the introduction of new top-level domains, "".biz"" and "".info"" in
Q4 provide catalysts to maintaining and increasing the
deferred revenue growth, an important metric with investors.
*We attribute yesterday's selloff to speculation re: the revenue
contribution of recently acquired Exault. After discussing the
acquisition with management we view the contribution as immaterial to our
model.

Paper & Forest Products P. Ruschmeier, .212.526.9898
MEA/W Merger Bullish For Consolidation Trend
*We recommend aggressive purchase of MEA (Strong Buy) and W (Buy) as the
announced combination between the companies
should create an estimated $1.95 BB ($9.83 per pro-forma share) of
shareholder value. The deal also supports our Strong Buy on SPP
and our Buy rating on BOW. Technical selling related to hedges on long
positions of MEA and W is possible on numerous large-cap
companies such as IP, WY, and GP but we view technical weakness as a buying
opportunity for fundamental investors.
*The MEA/W combo should create $1.95 BB of value (6.0X synergies of $325 MM)
or $9.83 per pro-forma share.
*Non-strategic asset sales are likely and we estimate rationalization of at
least 125K tons (1.2% U.S. supply) of coated paper capacity.
*We estimate only a 20% probability the deal is broken up.

Gaming & Lodging J. Minor, .617.342.4120
Lodging Industry RevPAR Falls Further in July, -6.0%
*Yesterday, Smith Travel Research released July lodging industry data
showing RevPAR declined further in July, down -6.0%, worse
than the -4.1% decline of June. The ""upper upscale"" segment where most
public companies are concentrated was down -10.9%
vs. -7.2% in June. While most lodging companies expected 3Q01 RevPAR results
to be slightly below 2Q01 levels, this is not an
auspicious start to 3Q01. With numbers like this, it's hard for us to say
you have to own the lodging stocks. But, we still expect our
downward earnings revisions will be less painful than the S&P's overall,
which should allow continued outperformance for the
lodging stocks. With the least downside risk, Marriott remains our favorite.
REITs with strong, safe yields like HMT and FCH are
also still attractive.

*Yesterday after the close, it was announced that IGT shares will be added
to the S&P 500 Index and removed from the S&P 400
Index. Our derivatives team expects a muted positive reaction in the shares.
Also, IGT announced that the FTC has requested
additional information on its proposed acquisition of SLOT. While such
information requests are common, it may signal that the
transaction will not just be ""rubber stamped"". We continue to see IGT's
earnings growth decelerating as current growth drivers abate
(California, new unit shipments) and we question other growth sources (no
acceleration in the replacement cycle). So, we reiterate
our 3-Market Perform and would use high volumes and price strength related
to the S&P 500 addition as an opportunity to pare
holdings.
*S&P announced that IGT will be removed from the S&P 400 and added to the
S&P 500. Our derivatives team expects a net buy of
3.941 mil shares, or about 4.3 days of volume. Our team notes that while an
S&P 500 addition is usually a positive, when combined
with a move out of the S&P 400, the reaction is generally muted.

*This note briefly highlights some of the datapoints from our meetings with

discussion stemmed around the company's strategy, regulatory
issues in the market, AFC's manufacturing process, the competitive
landscape, and new technologies.
*We would point out, however, the that time spent was also reassuring as the
tone conveyed by management was both confident and
optimistic, and we saw products labeled for shipment to a number of
carriers, both international and domestic, including Sprint, a
number of Independents, as well as both Verizon and SBC.
*We continue to rate AFCI shares 1 Strong Buy and reiterate our $30 price

"Crisis in Enron Japan","Dear top management,

I know how dangerous if I use my real name so please forgive me to
use this free email.
I studied Enron for a long time before there is a branch in Tokyo.
How glad when I received the offer from Enron Japan! I believe my life must
have been changed to a new chapter.

But now... I'm so disppointed with enron Japan's poor management.
We local staff think Joe and other ""experts"" are too young to manage
this company. Forgive my impolite, EJ is really like a kindergarden!

In order not to waste your time,I conclude some points here:

1. Joe's poor management not only makes everything confused but also
makes local staff fears. He is so cold and imprudent that Japanese is
difficult to communicate with him. I know he is from Harvard,but that
doesn't
mean he is human,he is sensitive.

2. It's very obvious that Joe conflicted with Jonathan and now we don't
think he works well with Jeremy. We want to know why you top management
always make such kind of combination. Joe only trusts the people he worked
together in Norway and Australia. He has strong discrimination with Jonathan
and Jeremy's people,also has strong discimination with local staff.

3. Enron Metal is in the same office with us but like a completely different
company. No any communication between Enron Japan and Enron metal.The same
situation can be seen with E-power.Japanese mass media are suprised why
Enron
set up two companies in Japan. E-power is enough!!! Look at GE, why they
succeed
the business in Asia. They make joint venture company first. Until they are
convinced they can succeed, they open branch. Learn from GE!

4. The experts from overseas countries are really cheeky,they are not modest
to hear local staff's opinions but just push their methods to us. We can't
see any
democracy in this company!! If you want to succed your business,you should
also
hear some opposite ideas.You shouldn't alianate the people who say different
things! We don't need young associate! Let them go home!!

5. We don't need young experts because Japanese clients won't do business
if the counterparty is too young. All of the young experts should go home.
They are wasting enron's money!! To send young experts here doesn't match
Japanese culture.


All of these are true. I love Enron and want to see Enron Japan become a
comfortable and profitable place to work.

Thanks&regards
Sato

"The Morning Market Call - Monday July 16th, 2001."," <<MF July 16th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Very late edition.

According to Jeff Applegate, Lehman Brothers' strategist, the prevailing
bear story on the market is that the market is now lower than it was six
months ago, after the initial Federal Reserve interest rate cut. The
implication is that something must be wrong. Well, one thing that we do know
is that earnings have been declining for the last six months. However,
according to Jeff, that  does not imply that the Fed is powerless. It only
means that memories are short.  In 1981, the same situation prevailed. The
market was down 6%, six months after the initial interest rate cuts from the
Fed. and  again in 1990, the market was down 14% after the same period.
However, Jeff does point out that on average, the S&P 500 was invariably up
18% after the initial Fed. easing. Given that Jeff's target by year end is
only 1450 on the S&P 500, the jury is still out. If the S&P reached that
level, it would only be 8% above the January 3rd level when the Fed. started
their easing process....and that would be at the low end of the historical
range.


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year is trading at 5.17%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.71%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $26.06 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.06 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

"Great editorial","Here's an editorial that gets to the heart of the matter.  



Tuesday, July 10, 2001        Ghost of Bob Citron roaming halls of capitol  Gray Davis is following footsteps of former O.C. treasurer into fiscal chaos     JOHN M.W. MOORLACH  Mr. Moorlach is the Orange County treasurer-tax collector.   A recent L.A. Times poll found that Californians still remain unconvinced that our state suffers from a shortage of energy. Perhaps the state's subsidizing of the actual costs for electricity these past five months has caused us to believe that everything is fine. It is not.  The state has been spending an average of $57 million, a medium-sized city's annual budget, per day for electricity. Now California is headed toward the same financial catastrophe that was imposed on its shareholder-owned utilities, finding one of them in Chapter 11 bankruptcy and another on the precipice. At this pace, it will not be long before the state will be staring a Chapter 9 bankruptcy filing in the face.  That's why I'm gnawed by this ""d?j? vu"" sensation. The similarities and parallels between California of 2001 and Orange County of 1994 are frightening. Here's a refresher. In 1994 the county, through former Treasurer Robert Citron, was borrowing at variable rates and investing at fixed rates. The ""experts"" and the ""politicos"" were comfortable with the investment scheme.  No wonder the electorate was convinced that there were no investing improprieties. Even while their former treasurer was very secretive about how he was investing and what his ""exit strategy"" would be. Guess what? The unexpected happened. Short-term borrowing rates doubled. The cost of borrowing suddenly exceeded the revenues being generated.  It caused the investment pool to implode and Orange County taxpayers realized a $1.64 billion loss. In spite of pleas to avoid or minimize this train wreck the county's leadership, he ignored it. The rest is history. In a half-pregnant deregulation scheme, the state capped the retail price that the utilities can charge. It also eliminated the availability to acquire electricity through the use of long-term contracts.  Guess what? The unexpected happened. The wholesale price for electricity spiked dramatically above the inflexible retail price cap. It depleted the available funds for the utilities, and then some, and they are imploding. In spite of pleas from the utilities imploring Gov. Gray Davis to avoid or minimize this train wreck, he ignored them. The rest is also history.  It gets worse. Davis doesn't allow for the immediate raising of retail rates and decides to have the state secretly purchase electricity. Guess what? The expected happened. He depleted our budget surplus! Our reserves! Nearly $9 billion - and counting! He's a Citron, only quintupled!  And in the light of day, the secret purchases were not attractively priced and only compound this financial nightmare. Gov. Davis has done what no Libertarian or Republican could ever dream of doing in such a short time. He has returned the budget surplus created by taxpayers to the residents of California by subsidizing their electricity bills.  Bravo! It may not be the most equitable way of refunding taxes, but has anyone ever thought up a more efficient method? But, that's not all. He wants it back! Davis now wants to borrow some $13 billion to replace the spent reserves and purchase even more electricity at rates in excess of the retail prices! When does this train wreck in slow motion stop?  And how do we pay off these bonds? Davis did not want to raise rates last summer or this past winter. But now he will to pay off this historically largest municipal bond offering with a significant utility rate increase. The ratepayers will be reminded for 10 years after Davis is gone about his expensive brilliance. And this elected official wants to purchase the power grids and bureaucratically manage the utilities? I say ""no.""  If we don't show some leadership in Sacramento soon, potential bond buyers will also say ""no,"" unless they receive an attractive interest rate. Just ask Edison International about attractive interest rates. It just subscribed $800 million in bonds paying 14 percent. Tragically, Gov. Davis walked into his position with an existing budget surplus and now has no tangible legacy to show for it. No reserves. No improved highways. No new schools. No infrastructure improvements. Only interest payments.  Wasn't that Citron's legacy? If amortized over 10 years at 6 percent, the citizens of California will pay an additional $4.4 billion in interest costs. Over 15 years it's $6.7 billion. And therein lies the true legacy of Davis, squandering the entire budget surplus that he inherited on interest resulting from his indecisiveness and lack of leadership!  It is so tragic that the perpetrator of this colossal mess is still in denial and continues to play the ""blame game."" Orange County played the ""blame game,"" too. But it had obvious perpetrators and succeeded in a court of law in securing a significant amount in retribution payments. I'm not so sure California will have a similar result.

"The National Grid","Hi Jeff.  I hope you are enjoying the challenge of running Enron in the
midst of all the excitement and change in the energy industry.

I want to bring to your attention an issue that affects me quite directly in
my new role as CEO of TransElect, an independent electric transmission
company.  I think it also affects Enron in a very significant way.  The
National Grid has applied to the FERC for a declaratory order that would
permit the Grid to operate the Alliance RTO (this is a Midwest RTO that
includes AEP, Exelon, DTE, CMS, First Energy and Dominion).

I believe quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the
Grid is a significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in
the Northeast (New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small
step from this decision to one that would allow Southern to operate
GridSouth, or one that would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in
exchange for FP&L operating the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National
policy, transmission operators should be independent of either the wholesale
or retail electric markets.  As a business issue, many transmission owners
are reluctant to divest of transmission because they retain hope that their
transmission can be used to protect above market native generation.  How
would you like to try shipping power into the Northeast with the Grid, a
major retail supplier and a significant generator, controlling access to the
market?

I think it is important that the FERC give the Grid a ""no"" on the request
for permission.  It is even more important that the issue be decided by the
""new FERC"".  There is a disturbing indication that the outgoing chairman
might okay this request on his way out the door.  I urge you to intervene as
a way to both slow down the freight train and as a way to get the right
answer out of FERC.  If you or your General Counsel would like more
information, give me a call at 503 636-7134, or call my General Counsel, Al
Statman, at 202 393-1200.

Thanks for considering the issue, and best wishes for continued success.

Fred Buckman

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       ""I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' "" Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment ""counterproductive rhetoric"" that ""does not  merit a response.""       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as ""outrageous,"" especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       ""You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. ""We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office.""       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to ""ratchet up"" the commentary to ""put [energy  companies] on notice"" that ""we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute.""       ""What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted,"" Lockyer said. ""Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity.""       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       ""Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity,"" Lockyer said. ""But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury.""        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, ""Let Lockyer be Lockyer.""  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this story.

"Fast Company Interview Today","Jeff -- 

You are scheduled to do a 30-minute telephone interview today at 2:30 p.m. with Fast Company magazine for an article about teaching.  The underlying premise for the article is that to be an effective leader, you must be an effective teacher within your organization.  The reporter, Chuck Salter, was referred to you by David Garvin at Harvard and by a Portland Oregonian reporter.  Given that you transformed how Enron does business by teaching the organization a new business model, this is an ideal opportunity for you and to highlight our non-traditional culture.  For the article, Chuck is also interviewing top executives at Pepsi, Yellow Warp, National Geographic and the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The interview questions are likely to include the following:

Tell me about the teaching you do at Enron, either formally or informally. What do you teach? Whom do you teach? 
Why is it important to you?
What are the principles that guide your teaching?
What do leaders need to know, think about, and do to be better teachers?
How do you measure or evaluate teaching within a corporation? 
Tell me about someone who has benefited from your teaching. 
Tell me about your favorite teachers and what you learned about teaching from them. 

I will come to your office at 2:30 to place the call.

Thank you.
Karen

"Teesside Update","
Dear Enron Employees:

I'm sorry to report that a third Enron employee has died in the hospital as a result of injuries from yesterday's explosion and fire at Teesside Power Station.  To lose another employee is a devastating blow to all of us.  A fourth employee remains in the hospital and is in stable condition.  Please keep these employees and their families in your thoughts and prayers.  We will release their names as soon as all family members and relatives have been notified.

I'm in the U.K. now and will be visiting with the employees and families who've been affected by this tragic accident.  I will also visit the site and will meet with authorities in order to determine the cause of the explosion.  I will keep you posted on any new developments.

"JEDI II","
The CalPERS board voted on Monday, June 18th to appoint a delegation, to be headed by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, to meet with chief executive officers of various energy companies (including Enron) to discuss with them CalPERS' concerns.  This action is a direct result of the continuing power crisis in California and the threat of a backlash which could lead to re-regulation of the energy industry in California, which could in turn hurt the long-term value of CalPERS' energy holdings.  CalPERS owns 2.6 million shares of Enron - less that 1/10th of 1% of the total value of CalPERS' assets and 6.2% of their total energy holdings. 

As a result of these actions, Enron and CalPERS halted their negotiations of the amendments to the JEDI II Partnership Agreement which would have expanded the investment opportunities available to JEDI II and thus funds available to various Enron business units (i.e. EBS).  Instead the partners agreed to a one year extension of the commitment period for Capital Contributions (limited to $100 million) under current Partnership Agreement terms and concurrently called a Suspension Event effective June 29, 2001.

What does this mean?  A Suspension Event prohibits any new investments being made by the JEDI II Partnership until the Suspension Event period is lifted.  We are uncertain at this point when that might be.  

I have attached below some press releases related to the issue.

If you have any questions or concerns please give me a call.

"Welome Back to Turkey","     Hello Sukran and Mark;
     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Thanks for taking time to call  yesterday.  Good luck with the Lockyer situation.  I truly do believe  that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer will prove more effective for  Enron than delayed or intermediated action.    As we discussed,  if I can be of any help with reconnaissance or as sounding  board, just let me know.
 
I have attached an article from  this morning's LA Times.  It provides an California view on how the  shakeup in the Senate might impact the state's energy  situation.  Certainly, by the time that President Bush visits  the California in a few days, the state's two Democratic US  Senators will be a good bit more empowered.

Jeffords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now.        The Vermont senator's widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California, particularly on  energy and environmental policy, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday.        The change, which Jeffords is expected  to announce today, could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity  crisis, these insiders said.       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week. In fact, the administration's  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords' decision.       At  the very least, Senate observers said, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity.       That doesn't  necessarily mean that the administration's critics will be able to have  everything their way. Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps,  for example, the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOP-dominated  House--and a likely veto if it made it to the president's desk.        Still, a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy.       ""It kicks up the dust,""  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity.        Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):  ""If President Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate, it will have  profound implications not just for California, but for the environment and  our nation's energy policy.""        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the  policies they care about.       All of a  sudden, they said, it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park, or that  the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress.       On the other hand, it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the region's oldest trees, consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling.        ""It's stunning how broad the  repercussions are, particularly on the environment,"" said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""We're trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards.""        For instance, Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants.  And if events play out as expected, he'll become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue.        Another issue under his purview would be  the two-decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation's spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.        ""Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey,""  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills. But with Democratic senators in charge, that would become less of a  threat, they said.       ""Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny,"" Francis said.        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees,  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes.        As part of a new Democratic majority,  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state.       ""That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board,"" predicted  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.        ""I think it means more attention to our  state, for sure,"" Boxer said. ""Right now, the president doesn't seem to  give a darn. They're all looking at California as a Democratic state.  They're not interested.""       Feinstein, who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis, may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration. She has been regarded as a  bridge-builder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past.        ""This has not been a warm and friendly  administration,"" she complained Wednesday. ""They've got people who know  all the answers and don't want to listen.""        The White House disputed that. In fact,  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the president's first  visit to California next week.       Under a  Democratic majority, Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees: the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the technology, terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund, waste control and risk assessment, and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism.        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords' expected party defection would be felt immediately.        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been ""openly hostile to California's  plight,"" and handed to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who supports Davis' request  for electricity price controls, according to Maviglio.        Democrats have assailed Bush's energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in charge  of the Senate, the administration would be more likely to compromise,  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increased  energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Attached is a short memo and summary outlining changes to the Business School Loan Program for the Western Hemisphere. As many of you know, over the past couple of months we have taken a hard look at our approach to business school loans. The updated guidelines better serve Enron's business interests, eliminate credit exposure for the company, and potentially broaden the reach of the Loan Program.

"Harrah's Entertainment Visit","Hi Joannie,

We spoke a week or so ago about the following:

Harrah's Entertainment (a new EES customer) will be spending the day in our offices tomorrow.  If Jeff's schedule permits, we'd love to have him stop by conference room 5029 and say hello.  Alternatively, we will be in Suite 8 at Enron Field tomorrow night if by chance he'd like to attend the game.  I know the odds are low, but it doesn't hurt to ask!

We signed a very profitable long-term power deal with Harrah's two months ago and a brief hello from Jeff would go a long way in helping us book additional business.

I've attached our agenda for tomorrow.

Thanks!

Ken

"Enron's secret bid to save deregulation - PRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his","
Jeff
 
Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).  
 
I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).  
 
Consistent with myconcern about a ""coast-to-coast  firestorm""engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.
 
q        Senator Calls  for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS
Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.
 
q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI
The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.
 
These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.
 
My feeling is that just as  with the ""business"" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation 
PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers 
Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/26/MN209410.DTL   
Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.  
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.  
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.  
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;  
and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.  
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.  
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.  
""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron  executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""  
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.  
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.  
One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers."" Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.  
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.  
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.  
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.  
D.C. CONNECTIONS
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.  
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.  
Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.  
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.  
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,  
but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.  
His intent is to listen to all sides.""  
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

"The Morning Market Call - Monday August 27th, 2001."," <<MF August 27th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Today, we thought that we would repeat some of the comments made by Jeff
Applegate, Lehman Brothers' US Investment Strategist this morning. In
summary, Jeff
reiterates that ""a turning point in the earnings cycle is at hand"" and this,
along "" with attractive valuation and accommodative policy"" should help
propel the market to the 1450 year-end S&P 500 price target. In fact, late
on Thursday, the market received some unaccustomed news - that being that
bell-wether networking
firm, Cisco Systems, was seeing signs of its business conditions
stabilizing. The U.S. stock market showed us on Friday that a little
evidence of corporate business stability could go a long way towards leading
the market higher. As Jeff says: "" Indeed, the broader stock market reaction
confirmed that it is still discounting deep reservations around the
prospects for an earnings recovery in the quarters ahead"". Despite the rally
on Friday, Jeff still feels that the market closed 16 percent below Lehman's
fair value on forward P/E ratio model. Just when no-one expects the market
to rally, it most likely will.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.46%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.92%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.48%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $26.62 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.55 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*We believe PNC is close to, if not at, the end point for downward EPS
revisions in this cycle. We continue to rate PNC 2 - Buy.
*Management appears to continue to focus on eliminating high risk activities
at PNC and steps should be taken to reduce the volatility
of private equity in the second half of 2001. Business conditions appear
stronger in Blackrock and PFPC than PNC Advisors.
*The pace of share repurchase activity should accelerate in 2H01 for the
following reasons: PNC has a substantial amount of excess
capital, it is generating lots of free capital flow, it has 12mm shares
remaining to repurchase under its existing authorization, and
there does not appear to be any large acquisitions requiring capital in the
near term.
*We think the success of the Regional Community Bank and its large
contribution to PNC (53% in 2Q01) will eventually force mgmt
to reconsider how aggressively they want to grow the business.

AmeriSource Health(AAS) 1 - Strong Buy L. Marsh, .212.526.5315
SUCCESS! Several implications w/ AAS/BBC combo
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $61 EPS 2000 N/A $1.89 N/A N/A

FY: 9/30 Price Target $68 $68
Rank 1 1
*We received good news from the FTC late on Friday - a unanimous decision to
allow the proposed merg. of Amerisource/Bergen to
proceed
*We are providing several follow-up observations from this determination,
after our more detailed commentary of speculation and
next-steps on Friday morning.
*We highlight three implications of some note: 1) greater visibility into
our raised targets on AAS (implied into BBC) and perhaps
above; 2) an updraft into now #4 player DKWD, closer to our $54 target, and
3) greater visibility of medical-supply platforms of
expansion into the future.
*If we were to suggest the FTC blocking of industry mergers in 1998 led to
several instances of irrational behavior and challenges
moves of diversification, we would believe that 2001's consolidation keeps
broader-based distractions to a minimum. As such,
despite what has been attractive appreciation in shares so far in 2001 (up
22%), we look for solid near-term envir. to continue.

FirstEnergy Corp(FE) 1 - Strong Buy D. Ford, .212.526.0836
Merger Approval Uncertainty Subsiding
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $30.74 EPS 2000 N/A $2.69 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $33 - 23 EPS 2001 $2.90E $2.90E $2.84E 10.6
Mkt Cap: $0.0MM EPS 2002 $3.20E $3.65E $3.23E 8.4
FY: 12/31 Price Target $37 $40
Rank 1 1
*With a New Jersey merger settlement in hand, approval uncertainty has
mostly cleared. We see upside to $40 for FE which when
combined with a 4.9% yield is 35% total return potential.
*On 8/24 FE, merger partner GPU, and other key parties reached a merger
settlement. We look for NJ approval in September, SEC
approval in October, and deal closing by early November.
*FE will retain merger synergies though agreed to limitations on employee
reductions and will reduce a power cost deferral balance by
$300M.
*We are raising our 2002E $0.45/share to $3.65 to reflect the absence of
goodwill under new accounting rules. We look for the GPU
deal to be modestly accretive in the first year. FE estimates $1.6B of
synergies over 10 years.
*FE is a great value at only 8.4x our 2002E which is a 20%+ group discount.
Our $40 target is 11x our $3.65 2002E.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Mortgage Finance B. Harting, .212.526.3007
Stocks Trade Down in Mortgage Finance ""Perfect Storm""
*Our sector traded down sharply on Friday, as a convergence of several
events created what we consider an irrational sell-off. We do
not believe that now is the time to exit the group, and feel that last
week's weakness has presented investors with a buying
opportunity. We reiterate our 1-Strong Buy ratings on Washington Mutual,
Golden West, Golden State, Greenpoint, Sovereign,
Charter One, and Astoria.

			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The unemployment numbers this morning were overall mixed. Unemployment
stayed at a solid 4.5% and non-farm payrolls fell by an as expected 42,000
in July. However, payrolls posted gains in revisions to the last two months
of a net 54,000. The 3-month moving average is now at a minus 31,000.
Preliminary GDP estimates had previously suggested anemic second quarter
growth of only  0.7%. However, subsequent data on inventories and
construction indicate a possible  0.9 percentage point downward revision in
GDP, raising the chances for the first negative quarter since the 1990
recession. Lehman Brothers' economists continue to believe the Federal
Reserve will be aggressive in responding to any further economic weakness
and they expect  25 basis point rate cuts at each of the next two FOMC
meetings. In the coming weeks, we will be keeping close tabs on every
economic indicator of consumer spending for any deterioration.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.5%.

*WMI reports 2Q EPS on 8-8 before the opening. No material changes expected
with turnaround story intact, but likely fine-tuning on
economic story.
*Economic story highlighted in the meager volume growth expected, commodity
price weakness and down margin performance
versus pro forma.
*Expect turnaround outlook to remain in tact, with sequential core pricing
improvement and some slight evidence of improved cost
control.
*Waste stocks that have already reported exhibited some stock price weakness
on EPS miss and revision concerns, before rebounding.
WMI could provide sidelined investors with similar opportunity.

*Yesterday shares of Concord EFS were under pressure, closing down $2.18 or
3.8% - above the lows of the day.
*We believe that the reason was likely that positive comments in the
technology sector caused rotation out of the defensive Payments
Processing sector.
*We continue to believe that despite the strong performance of Concord EFS
thus far in 2001 (+24.7%) the shares have more upside
potential due to the company's high degree of leverage to debit card
processing - online debit processing in particular.
*Over the remainder of the year, we expect Concord EFS to announce the
addition of new bank partners to the Star network and new
retailers as well, driving EPS growth of 30+%.
*We believe that Concord's relatively predictable earnings growth deserve
continued investor attention and we would use yesterday's
weakness as a buying opportunity.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Oil & Gas T. Driscoll, .212.526.3557
Exploration & Production: Gas Supply is Rising -- Still Bearish
*Gas prod'n in Canada is sharply higher and US prod'n has turned upward. A
growing storage overhang and weak gas demand makes
us cautious on E&P shares. This supply overhang combined with weak demand
could lead to a prolonged period of weak nat. gas
prices and falling share prices.
*Q2 wellhead (i.e. not dry gas) prod'n for a group of 37 producers (that
account for 60% of the total) is up 1.7% from Q4 levels. If
second half prod'n rises at the same rate, year 2001 exit rates will be up
3-4%.
*Canadian prod'n was up an estimated 8% in June from a yr. ago. Recent
Ladyfern discovery has contributed a little over one-third of
this increase -- and Ladyfern volumes could double from here.
*Year end (i.e. Dec. 31) storage levels are likely to by 700 bcf above
prior-year levels.

Rank 1 1
*GILD shares have been under pressure in recent days from concerns about
regulatory risk to their lead HIV drug tenofovir (now
Viread). We believe that the risk to Viread at the FDA is now discounted in
the share price, and further expect excellent newsflow out
of Gilead over the next several quarters.
*Gilead's shares have suffered in sympathy with each company that has faced
a setback at the FDA over recent weeks. While we
remain cautious about approval timelines for any new drugs at the FDA, we
believe that the risk of a prolonged delay is lower for
Viread than for most other drugs.
*The company remains upbeat about the approval process in our recent
conversations.
*The remaining 1000 patients from the old Preveon expanded access program
have just switched to Viread, showing that the FDA
recognizes the risk/reward of Viread as superior to its older cousin.

*PDLI reported a net income of $3.1 million or $0.07 per diluted share
versus Street and Lehman estimates of $0.06 and $0.09 per
share, respectively.
*Operating revenues for the quarter were $12.7 million, compared with our
$14.0 million forecast. The shortfall can be accounted for
by uneven timing in payments from partners and licensees.
*Given that fees and milestone payments from humanization agreements are
difficult to predict, we are taking operating revenues this
year down from $48.0 million to $43.9 million. We are also removing Xolair
royalties from our model in 2002.
*The net impact of these changes on EPS is a decrease from $0.11 to $0.05 in
2001, and from $0.14 to $0.13 in 2002.

I was extremely sorry to hear of the tragic incident at your Teesside
facility.  I'm sure that your immediate concern is to ensure the well-being
of those employees and families directly impacted.

However, I'm equally certain that you will insist on a detailed Root Cause
Analysis of the incident to minimize the potential of a recurrence.   The
objective, expert assessment
of a qualified third party can serve to reinforce and add credibility to
such an analysis. These efforts are typically sanctioned by the Board of
Directors.

Our firm, Pilko & Associates, is an international management consulting firm
focused on high profile EHS assignments.  We rountinely consult for BP and
Shell in London- and are currently assisting BP in investigating whistle
blower claims on the North Slope. After a recent incident, the Board of
Directors of Phillips Petroleum retained us to lead a Blue Ribbon Panel to
investigate the situation at their Pasadena chemicals complex.

We have a 10+ year track record assisting Enron on high profile EHS
assignments.  We are well known by your M&A team; Terry Thorne and Mike
Terraso.

I will call your office on Tuesday to followup on this email.

Best regards-  George Pilko

THE WORLD TECHNOLOGY SUMMIT &
THE WORLD TECHNOLOGY AWARDS

GlaxoSmithKline.

What is the World Technology Network (WTN)?

WTN is a global association of some of the most important and innovative
people in the technology world, focused on making a wide range of
emerging technologies (info. tech., biotech/medical, new materials,
energy, communications, and space-related technologies, etc.) happen
sooner and better than they might have otherwise. WTN is made up of not
just of the technologists, but also the financiers, marketers,
journalists, policy makers, etc. -- all of those who have a role, at one
time or another, in making technological concepts come to fruition. We
are identifying the people who will likely play a key role in the
technological drama over the next years and decades and bringing them
together to create relationships that will accelerate the application of
these technologies. We are trying to increase the chances of the 'happy
accidents' which can occur when cutting-edge ideas, entrepreneurial
people, and institutions with vision collide to create innovation. We
like to say that our main goal is 'encouraging serendipity.'


Who is a WTN member?

WTN's membership is primarily composed of laureates of our World
Technology Award program, who are selected through a rigorous process
involving over 100 nominators and judges. It includes leading technology
and business innovators such as Steve Jobs of Apple, John Chambers of
Cisco, Masayoshi Son of Softbank, etc. These are the people driving the
future and they are the sort of people brought into the Network.  Other
Finalists or Winners for the 1999/2000 World Technology Awards, who
were, therefore, inducted as members, included: Jeff Hawkins/Donna
Dubinsky (co-creators, Palm Computer) for IT-Hardware; John Sulston
(Director, Sanger Centre) for Biotechnology; Dave Thompson (founder,
Orbital Sciences) for Space; Amory Lovins (co-founder, Rocky Mountain
Institute) for Environment; Geoffrey Ballard (founder, Ballard Power
Systems) for Energy, etc. A full list of the laureates can be found on
the WTN web site (http://www.wtn.net). The WTN membership is truly
extraordinary and the WTN membership is the core of who is invited to
the World Technology Summit.


What is the World Technology Summit?

The World Technology Summit is an historic two-day gathering (July 1/2,
2001) of several hundred of the world's key technology players  -
scientists, technologists, entrepreneurs, industrialists, financiers,
journalists, and policy-makers - to explore and catalyse the emerging
technologies that will have the greatest impact upon industry and
society in the 21st Century and to create the relationships which will
help those technologies and the companies behind them to succeed. The
Summit brings together Network Members, Fellows and other specially
invited delegates to think deeply about emerging technologies - how they
will likely impact tomorrow on today's industries and those industries
yet to be born. The Summit will cover six key technologies -
information, communications, materials, energy, biotechnology/medicine,
and space - as well as developments in the other related areas - of
finance, marketing, policy, etc. - which determine whether a good idea
ever becomes more than an idea.


Where Will the World Technology Summit Be Held?

The Summit will be hosted at one of the most prestigious scientific
institutions in the world -- Imperial College of Science, Technology,
and Medicine in London.  Located in the beautiful South Kensington area
of London, nestled amongst the National Museum of Science & Industry,
the Victoria & Albert Museum, the Natural History Museum, and the Royal
Albert Hall, Imperial College was recently ranked second, above Oxford
University, in the UK university league tables. Sir Richard Sykes, the
new head (""Rector"") of Imperial College, who also serves as Chairman of
the newly merged GlaxoSmithkline, will be actively participating in the
Summit, both as a speaker and in his role as ""host.""


What about the World Technology Awards?

The last evening of the Summit will be capped by a gala ceremony during
which we will present the second annual World Technology Awards,
recognising those involved in technology who are taking the actions and
making the decisions with the greatest likely long-term impact on
business and society.

Awards are given in 24 categories.  The World Technology Award for:

information technology/hardware        information technology/software
communications technology                biotechnology
space                                                health & medicine
energy                                                materials
policy                                                entrepreneurship
design                                                the arts
media & journalism                            finance
commerce                                        marketing communications

law                                                    transportation
environment                                     education
entertainment                                    social entrepreneurship

ethics                                                Innovator of the
Year

Each of the cutting-edge Award finalists and eminent nominators will be
invited to be key participants in the World Technology Summit, and
simultaneously will be given membership in The World Technology Network.



Are the World Technology Summit and the World Technology Awards truly
historic?

There has never been a gathering of so many of the leaders of so many
technological fields in one place at one time before in history. They
will be there not because they were paid to be there or because they
have to be there, but because they have been selected by their peers to
honor each other. They are gathering to meet the only group of people
with whom they do not have to be on the defensive - other people equally
or more innovative than each of them believe they are themselves. Only
that level of ""elite""-ness can create the intrigue that cuts through the
usual and defines the historic.


What about the World Technology Awards ceremony?

This year's (2001) World Technology Awards ceremony will be held in the
new  Wellcome Wing of the Science Museum, immediately adjacent to the
World Technology Summit site on the campus of Imperial College.  The new
wing is the largest museum facility in the world devoted to new
technologies and it's a wonderfully appropriate site to recognise
history in the making.  An interactive exhibit is also being developed
which will enable thousands of Museum visitors to vote and comment on
Finalists for the World Technology Awards during the week leading up to
the Awards on the evening of July 2nd.

The physical Awards themselves are also worth noting.  Richard Meier,
the world-famous architect, is designing them as contribution to these
initiatives.  Meier's most renowned projects include, among many others:
the Getty Center in Los Angeles; the High Museum in Atlanta; the
Frankfurt Museum for Decorative Arts in Germany; Canal+ Television
Headquarters in Paris; the City Hall and Central Library in the Hague;
the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona; and, the Church of the Year
2000 at the Vatican.


What's the Summit agenda?

The World Technology Summit will feature leading speakers from both
technology and industry, all the way from the laboratory to the
boardroom; Mostly drawn, of course from the WTN membership.  The Summit
will consist of both plenary meetings and breakout sessions.  Keynote
speakers will provide a visionary overview of the interacting roles of
technology and business.  Session speakers will provide insights into
their own particular specialty.  Panel speakers will intellectually
challenge each other in open session.  And, all will contribute to a
stimulating debate. The World Technology Summit is a gathering where ALL
participants are key players with a crucial role to play in the
unfolding drama of technology.

Sessions will focus on a range of goals -- providing a good grounding in
all  six of the major emerging tech. areas; on networking opportunities
for participants; and, on developing new ideas for new businesses, new
corporate initiatives, new partnerships, and even new industries.

A primary feature of the Summit will be a series of 23 concurrent
two-hour breakout workshops in each of the Award categories. These
Summits-within-the-Summit will be made up of the delegates themselves.
As each of them are amongst the key leaders globally in their own field,
simply gathering them in a room creates an important mini-summit...
catalytic in and of itself.

Another very exciting feature of the Summit will occur just before its
conclusion.  All of the delegates will be assigned to work in small
roundtable groups of ten.  Their charge:  to create an ideal emerging
technology based business for the 21st Century.  Each roundtable group
will include an assortment of top-level expertise and will be given a
topic/field in which to focus.  We expect more than a few new lines of
businesses, joint ventures, investment and acquisition strategies, and
even altered career paths to grow out of what with any ordinary group of
people would just be considered a simple ""exercise.""  All Summit
delegates and sponsors/partners will, of course, receive outlines of all
of the new ""businesses"" created.

We also working on organising a plenary session focused on social and/or
environmental ""global challenges"".  The potential for substantive social
partnership between the WTN membership and organizations active in
addressing global problems is enormous. We do not intend to waste the
opportunity.

Whether it's the plenary sessions, the Summits-within-the-Summit; the
new business creation process, or, of course, the ongoing interaction
within the Network throughout the year... what happens when you bring
together the people who are creating the future and who are changing the
world?

We'll  soon find out....

Masa:

I enjoyed our evening together on the boat in Yokohama harbor very
much.  As promised, I have been in contact with Jeff Skilling at Enron.
He is interested in meeting with you.

Here's what we know:

INSIDE ARGENTINA
Cavallo is at the edge, very reliably reportedly asking for more power from De La Rua or else.  Markets are already rife with resignation rumors
Domestic political opposition to deficit cut plan is general in Argentina - both in coalition and among opposition, particularly federal v. provincial leaders.  Implementing past cuts still incomplete and willingness to take further local, domestic pain for international markets is very weak.
Efforts afoot to try and swap out of short-term Letes (91-day) debt into 1 year, but current conditions (200%+ overnight rates) make it all but impossible

USTreasury, IMF
There is no sign of any willingness, either at the IMF or Treasury, to do anything for Argentina.  Recent events have only confirmed O'Neill's bias against bail-out - he believes it will only be a temporary save and that current problems will be constantly revisited going forward
USTreasury briefed Fed yesterday on strategy and the bottom line is that Brazil is seen as the best place to make a stand.  There are three arguments behind this: 
	- First, there is nothing that can reliably save Argy at this point and it is better to husband resources and credibility for use elsewhere if Argy blows-up; 
	- Second, there are reasons to support Brazil, both for itself and for international contagion concerns: defending Brazil is the best way to quarantine 	  Argy effects; Brazil has problems internally, but they are seen a more likely to be solved than in Argy aid that they have been exacerbated by Argy;  
	- Third, defending Brazil is seen as first line defense of Mexico, which is seen as necessary to defend for domestic US political and economic reasons, apart 	  from the additional international concerns.

"Economist Interviews","
Jeff Skilling
Mike McConnell
Greg Piper
John Arnold

Thank you for agreeing to interview with Vijay Vaitheeswaran of the Economist on Tuesday.  Mike is scheduled for 12:30, Jeff for 2 p.m., Greg for 3 p.m. and John for 4 p.m.

Vijay is working on a story about old economy companies embracing the Internet.  He'll be testing the idea put forward by Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT that companies profiting most from the Internet are ones with a culture of openness.  As background, he has secured an advance copy of a new Harvard Business School case on EnronOnline, which basically outlines the advent of EOL.  It's a story that you all know well, and so you should not be disadvantaged if you don't have a copy of the study. (I can give you one if you want it.)

Specifically, he'll be probing:
How did the company begin to think about using the Internet?  Have our views altered?
What role models did we use?
What changes have worked best and why?
How far has success been dependent on changing corporate culture? Has it gone far enough?
What has been the impact on staffing?  Do we have the right people to do what needs to be done?
Has the Internet made -- or will it make -- substantial cost savings?  What is the scale of investment needed?
Will the Internet change the way we work with suppliers/distributors (where applicable).

Other companies on the list to be interviewed include GE, 7-Eleven, Siemens, Merrill Lynch, Cemex and Valeo.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you in the afternoon.

summer long
on power

Cinergy CEO Jim Rogers told Restructuring Today in a three-part
interview that this summer prices will be low and electric supplies
plentiful.
     Is it the result of the June 1998 price spike that rose to $7,500?
Did the high price lure in generation that's now providing ECAR
consumers with economical prices at a time when the West Coast is being
punished for not doing the same?
     ""The short answer is yes,"" Rogers replied.
     ECAR is getting 4,000 mw more capacity this summer, he added.
     Rogers thinks the Ohio market will be slow to open and may not get
robust for five years.  He was critical of other IOUs that are dragging
their feet in RTO formation.

Hello Jeffrey,
I came across your company information as I was conducting research on the Dallas Business Journal website. The article mentioned that Enron was moving into an office complex in Frisco, TX and could potentially employ up to 100 employees. 
I have recently been laid off as a contract/corporate recruiter with Nortel Networks and am interested in pursuing opportunities with Enron as you grow into your new Frisco location. By bringing my recruiting skills and background in-house as a contract or corporate recruiter, Enron can save thousands of dollars in potential external headhunter fees.
Attached is my resume for your review and distribution. If you have any questions or require further information, don't hesitate to contact me directly at 214 755 2860 or jen_recruiter@yahoo.com .

"Park Place Entertainment (PPE)","Background:

We've been working with this company for a long time. As a matter of fact its been almost two years. It has undergone all of the org changes on our side and was handed to my group in the 4th quarter of 2000. There have also been numerous changes in their organization. The crazy markets in California finally got them to transact with us for a 5yr power and gas deal about 60 days ago. We did a fixed priced all in retail rate for them as they really wanted price and budget certainty. They spend about $50mm/ yr on gas and power. There has been a lot of concern by the street about the impact of power prices on the gaming industry. As a matter of fact, Bear Stearns issued a report specifically highlighting the streets concerns about rising power prices in the gaming industry and the adverse effect on EPS/

We are currently trying to close the second part of this deal which involves a demand-side management program. In essence we estimate that we would invest about $20-22mm in capital (thru off-balance sheet operating leases) to reduce their demand and provide them with about $27mm in nominal savings over the next 10 years. This translates into guaranteed savings to them $2.8mm/yr for the first 5 years and then $2.6mm/yr for the back 5 years. 

We are trying to close this portion of the deal by the end of the week. It creates great value for both companies. 

Between Park Place and Harrah's we are in a great position to sign-up the other big gaming players, such as MGM/Mirage and Mandalay Bay. As a matter of fact we sponsored an event in Vegas last week where we had all of the top people from these companies.


The Issue and the reason for your call:

Tom Gallagher, who is the CEO of Park Place and recently joined them from Hilton Hotels earlier this year, is not convinced the he should do the demand side management program, despite support from his CFO, Scott LaPorta and his head of Operations, Mark Dotson. A call from you addressing the issues outlined below, I think, would help put this one over top. In particular, I think the first point is his greater concern.

He lives in California and has seen all of the ""bad"" press about Enron and is concerned about what he is reading and whether or not he wants to get deeper with Enron. In essence, hearing from you about what is really going on in California and that we are on the side of Angels in essential. It is also nice for him to know that if things do go wrong, he can call someone like you.

He doesn't understand why his in-house team can't do the demand side program themselves. This as you know, is the classic issue of insource vs outsource. Since it has taken so long to get to this point, he is a bit concerned that it will take us another 18 months to get consumption reduction projects going. We have done all of the necessary due diligence, priced and valued the opportunity and are ready to pull the trigger across all of his 9 facilities. We are the ones responsible for identifying, designing and executing. We clearly have the expertise, scale and technical capability that he just doesn't have in-house or they would have done this already. Again, just hearing from you, at a high-level, should help convince him why he should look to us vs his in-house people. We are also going to have him reference Art Coppola, CEO of Macerich to re-affirm why they decided to turn over demand side management to Enron.

His number is 702-699-5100. The 1-on-1 call from you would really help. He is meeting with his management committee tomorrow to make the go/no-go call on this.

Thanks so much and let me know if you have any questions. I will be in Chicago tomorrow working on our deal with City Airports, but my assistant Sharon Dick, can reach me if you have any questions. She is at 3-6761.
Thanks,
Jeremy

"Speaker invitation to Economist Conference 24-25 October","Dear Mr Skilling

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

"YPO Member Survey","Hello Everyone!

I'm Andy Cunningham, a member of the 2001 Board of Directors and Chairman of Communications for the YPO International Executive Committee.

Several weeks ago I sent out an email announcing our plans to conduct an important research effort among the YPO membership.  We would now like to invite you to share your opinions with us by participating in an online survey.

As a reminder, we are conducting this research in an effort to better understand our current membership base and determine how best to attract this century's premier leaders to our organization.  During David Martin's term as Chairman of the International Board, YPO will be going through an evolution to continue to be relevant in the current, and tomorrow's, business world.  We believe this research is a first step towards meeting the vision of the Board.

Below please find links for the Multimedia version of the Harvard cases completed in final form last month.  The text of the multimedia case is the same as that previously forwarded.  I have reviewed these multimedia cases and they are very cool!

I will be forwarding Releases to each of you for signature.  Please return the releases as soon as possible as Meg Wozny at Harvard, with whom I've been working on these for the past few months, is leaving HBS at the end of June--I'd like for her to have the satisfaction of finalizing this project before she leaves.

Harvard reports that these cases are best sellers!  Also, we enjoyed an ""Enron day""at Harvard April 26th; it received such rave reviews that Harvard has requested a similar event for this summer.

Thanks to all of you for your participation and help!

"HERE'S THE VERY BEST","There's something about cycling that brings out the best.....and here's a couple of great examples of the very best.....Ansel Michaels and his valiant, successful attempt to do the distance, and Charles Delacey's desire to help make that journey less painful for Ansel.  I hope you find it in your hearts to salute the efforts of each of them by offering your support.  

Charles is a member of Team Enron and was the first rider in to LaGrange this year, arriving 11:15 am.  Please read the following, and if you have questions, his e-mail is Charles.Delacey@enron.com, telephone: 713-853-5757.  THANK YOU!

Subject:	Ansel Michaels/MS150

Ansel Michaels is a 15-year-old freshman at Lamar High School.  Ansel swims on the Lamar swim team and this year, for the first time, joined his swimming teammates on the 2001 MS 150.  Ansel is a paraplegic and rides a hand crank bike in which he is seated and pedals with his arms.  On the first day into LaGrange, Ansel suffered two blowouts and still managed to ride 93 miles before being asked to stop by support crews.  Sunday morning, he was back in the saddle and finished all 72 miles in time to catch the final bus back to Houston.  

Ansel pedaled a hand crank bike that was more suited to going around the block than to Austin.  The gears did not work properly and his bike made an extremely difficult task harder than it should have been.  Ansel has limited resources and has already talked about how excited he is about riding in general and the MS150 for next year.  I am asking for donations to help Ansel buy a new bike.  A decent hand crank bike costs aprox. $3,000.  Any donations in excess of the cost of the bike will be contributed to the MS Society.  An account has been established at West University Bank and checks should be payable to Ansel Michaels.  Donations can be sent to:

"Opportunity","Jeff,

I was disappointed to learn of Philippe's departure from Enron.  I have been continually impressed with his accomplishments and more importantly, at his extensive knowledge of Enron's business and priorities.

I would like to submit my name for consideration as a replacement for the position of CTO at Enron Networks.  I realize the importance of the role that I fulfill with Enron Broadband and understand how difficult it would be at this time for me to leave EBS; however I could not allow this opportunity to pass without expressing my interest.  I am sure that a suitable solution could be formulated if it was determined that I would be the right fit for the CTO role.

I appreciate your consideration, and will make myself available if you would like to discuss my qualifications.

Respectively,

Everett

"Follow-up on Davis, Lockyer meeting","Calif Fails To Find Illegal Acts By Generators -Sources
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

(This article was originally published Monday.) 

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons familiar with the probe said Monday.
The sources - including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators aren't likely to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold supply, and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative. 
""We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal,"" one PUC commissioner said. 
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night, spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing. 
""We have not called off the dogs,"" Maviglio said. ""We're still pressing the attorney general to pursue the investigation."" 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to take legal action against generators, but that claim was ""premature,"" another PUC commissioner said. 
The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and earlier this year, but after dozens of interviews with economists, traders and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal behavior. 
""We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace, that's documented,"" one of the commissioners said. ""The question is whether that's illegal, and I don't think it is."" 
The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices, the other commissioner said, because it passed a flawed deregulation bill. 
""The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers, in the best interest of their shareholders, to do exactly what they have done,"" the commissioner said. ""Unless they're talking with each other and there is evidence of absolute colluding, we're not going to get to first base."" 
The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Williams Cos. (WMB), Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and others, but that too is going to be difficult. 
""How do you sue someone for being unethical,"" the person in Lockyer's office said. 
A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldn't comment, but said the probe is ongoing. 
Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldn't comment on the investigation, but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC. The generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully. 
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California at Berkeley Energy Institute, said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise. 
""I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust behavior,"" Borenstein said. Prosecuting generators is ""a longshot,"" he said: ""They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys were in the same room."" 
Phil Verlager, an economist specializing in energy issues, said generators didn't even act unethically, because the setup of California's deregulation law allowed generators to get away with withholding power. 
Even if no smoking gun has been found, tough talk by PUC President Lynch scared the suppliers, the commissioner said. 
""They got the message that they ought to play the game."" 
Lynch didn't return calls for comment. 
Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a ""function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento."" 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable prices, even if it isn't illegal, Borenstein said.

Calif Gov:Evidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California investigations have turned up a ""growing body of evidence"" that may allow the state's attorney general to pursue criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power prices in the state, the office of California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday. 
The governor's office didn't detail that evidence, however, and persons familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence exists.
""The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of civil and criminal actions,"" Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a short written statement. ""There is a growing body of evidence that may give the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as civil actions."" 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by generators operating in the state's wholesale electricity market. Maviglio didn't disclose further details of the investigation. 
Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld, but hasn't been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal. 
""There is no evidence of criminal behavior,"" one said. ""It just doesn't exist."" 
S. David Freeman, senior energy adviser to Davis, acknowledged the distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington, D.C., about allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices. 
""It may not be criminal conduct, but it's a crime,"" he said. 
Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators, because there's likely no smoking gun. 
Any claim that the investigation hasn't turned up evidence of criminal activity is an ""overstatement,"" Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said. 
The investigation is ongoing, she said. 
Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent sharp decline in power prices in the West. An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to prosecuting the energy companies ""so they will continue to play the game."" 
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is fixed.

Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data

06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) against the state's attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed documents from being shared with third parties. 
Superior Court Judge George H. Wu said he would take the case under submission and issue a written ruling in less than 90 days.
Reliant, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) agreed May 22 to turn over confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the state's wholesale power market. 
Reliant agreed to turn over the information, which includes bid data, as long as Lockyer's office agreed not to share it with third parties. 
Lockyer said last month that he wouldn't share the information pending a court hearing on the issue.

I have a major problem with Ben Glisan being deleted, especially without a chance to comment.  I believe he is as critical to the organization as all of the ""tier two"" members (and has had a larger p/l contribution).  If you disagree, I need to know so I can appropriately set his expectations.  I look at this list and I cannot discern the standard for inclusion.

Thank you for your kind invitation to participate in the interesting program that you are sponsoring in October.  Unfortunately, I have a conflicting commitment and will be unable to attend.  May I pass the information on to one of the other Commissioners here, or have you also invited others from our commission?
Thank you.

"Interview","
In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

Thank you for considering this request.

"New Dialing Instructions","
To:          All Enron Houston Users
 
Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key
 
REVISED DIAL STRINGS FOR ENRON TIE LINE NETWORK
Users must dial 8 digits to call via Tie Lines

Hello Mr. Skilling:

I am going to be joining the Enron Associate Class of February 2002(from The
University of Chicago).

Sir, I have a question.  I was wondering what your thoughts might be regarding
the creation of an operation to trade interest rate products?  I am certain
that yield curve exposure is a significant source of risk that certain areas of
Enron must already be addressing.  However, to the best of my knowledge,  I
don't think Enron actually trades interest rate products?

If there is any interest in doing so, I would be very pleased to offer my time
to assist in researching the potential feasibility and profitability while
still a student, and before I report to Enron.

Yours respectfully,

Kamran Gill

"HBS Ballot Letter","Dear HBS Club Members:

My term as President of the HBS Club of Houston is rapidly nearing its
completion.  Thank you for helping make it a wonderful year and a great
experience for me.

The Directors and Officers have worked hard instituting new programs in an
effort to make membership in the club a valuable experience.  We began the
year with several goals:

?  Increase membership by offering a more varied program of interest to a
broader cross-section of alumni
?  To increase average event attendance by having renowned speakers talk on
provocative topics
?  To increase participation from a number of segments within our club
?  Young Alumni (less than 10 years since graduation)
?  Non-MBA alumni
?  To change the experience to allow more relationship building among alumni

Our hard work has paid off and we owe our members many thanks for their
support and confidence.  Membership this year approached 300 people, up
from 268 the prior year.  Attendance per event is up 14% over historical
averages.  We have added two new programs  the breakfast club and the
social hours.  Breakfast club membership stands at 42, exceeding our
expectations.  Social hour participation averages about 15 to 20 while
showing signs of acceptance and growth.

I would like to thank the officers for their assistance and support.  Each
of them has worked hard to make this a great year for our members.
?  Sean Daichman - Treasurer, Breakfast Club and Energy Finance Panel
?  Nisha Desai - Monthly Socials
?  Anuj Gupta - Dot.com Panel
?  Kim Kehoe - Monthly Socials, Bob Stobaugh event
?  Steve Latham - Venture Capital Panel
?  John Meckert - Applicant Reception
?  Stuart Page - Website
?  Elliott Smith - Directory

I would also like to thank our Board of Directors.  They have provided
valuable direction for improving the club's value to its members.  In
particular, I would like to thank our outgoing directors - Chuck Bratka,
David Daniel, Cathryn Rodd and Susan Rheney.  I would also like to
recognize Osmar Abib and Kevin Bartol for helping to organize and ensure
the success of the breakfast club.

Finally, I would like to thank Dottie Kerr for helping with all of the
administrative support.  Organizing events is a critical function with many
details to make things run smoothly.  Dottie and her daughters eased the
burden on the club's officers substantially.

We have worked with the nominating committee of the Board to identify a
slate of officers and directors for next year.  We believe that those
people on the ballot will continue to build the club into one of the
premier alumni clubs in the country.

To simplify the voting process, if you choose to vote by e-mail, you may
vote for the entire slate of officers and directors by typing the word AYE
followed by your name on the Subject line before replying to Dottie.
Otherwise, please complete the ballot and fax to 281-424-4770 or email
dottie@kerr-solutions.com by June 8, 2001.

Thank you again for your support and for allowing me to serve you during
the past year.

Kindest regards,

George Laflin

"Datacentric Broadband","	

		
Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric Broadband (DCB). 

1.	The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2.	DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is critical to success.

3.	We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4.	We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested in the investment.

5.	DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6.	About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7.	We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commitment.

8. 	At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal structure by the end of May.

	 We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

	I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

"Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request","I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record & loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

Subject:	Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

"Enron Candidate","Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

"Late Modification of Southwest Power LLC Divestiture DASH","Late last night, BKH requested ENA to guaranty the indemnification obligations of TLS Investors, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ECT and the Member Manager of Southwest Power LLC.  The guaranty will be capped at the adjusted purchase price, presently expected to be in the range of $205 million to $220 million, and will remain in place for 18 months from the Closing Date.

RAC's view is that exposure under such a guaranty would not be materially different from exposure under a direct indemnity provided by ENA if ENA were the actual legal entity selling Southwest Power LLC.  RAC supports the issuance of such guaranty to facilitate completion of the divestiture.

Chairman & CEO
Enron Broadband Services
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX 77002 USA

Dear Mr. Rice:

Further to the call today, I have been referred to you by the office of Mr. Skilling.  For added background, I have had the pleasure of working with some of your US and Asian-based executives on transactions, notably Mike Gaffud in the Philippines regarding the sale of an equity interest in Subic Power, and meeting some of your board members including Mr. Ronnie Chan of Hong Kong, while working abroad in Asia. This follows a banking relationship with you all from a Bank of America stint.

I am in touch on a newly-formed entity, TeliOn Broadband, of which I am a partner.  It is an early mover, capital efficient fixed wireless integrated service provider (WISP) owning last mile applications in the focused markets we have researched and chosen.  Many of which are already in markets that Enron has presence. Attached please find the executive summary for your review.

We are in the process of our Series A launch and beta tests.  After meeting internally and given national scalability, would like to invite Enron Corporation and its affiliate, Enron Broadband Investments, to review as a potential partner for this round. From what we understand, there seems to be some complementation to your current wireless communication interests and broadband initiatives. Supplementally, there may be a relationship to explore regarding co-location on certain tower sites. At an appropriate future point, there may be a couple of third party co-investment structures, in addition to Cisco Systems interests, for possible discussion.

Look forward to our being in touch.  We would be pleased to meet for a proper presentation to your firm.  Additional materials can be made available as needed in the form of our powerpoint overview and consolidated pro-forma from our financial model.

Finally, we would appreciate a receipt confirmation of this delivery.  Thanks for your kind attention.  Should you have questions in the interim, please feel free to contact me via below.

With Kind Regards,

I just spoke to Jeff who had just finished his phone call with Dorman (ATT).  Jeff said that Dorman was very interested in our proposal and even had some ideas on expanding the scope of our ideas.  He said that Dorman would like to get together on Weds.  June 6 in Washington DC to continue the discussions.  I'm not quite sure what this means except that it appears that Dorman does have a genuine interest in exploring a big deal with EBS.  So I would recommend that we get together early next week with Jeff and maybe with the Adventis guys and prepare for the 6/6 meeting.

"Xcelerator Investment Board","Gentlemen

I've had an opportunity to visit with many people across Enron over the last couple of weeks and have begun to shape the Xcelerator into an initiative that can create exciting businesses for Enron.  As many of us have discussed, a crucial part of the initiative's success will be the visibility and involvement of Enron's senior leadership in overseeing our efforts and major investment decisions.  After discussing the composition of that oversight board with Jeff Skilling and Greg Whalley, I would greatly appreciate your participation on that board.  Our objective is to reflect the breadth of the company while keeping the group small enough for effective, expedited decision making.

I anticipate that the board's role will be to give directional guidance to the Xcelerator's overall process and focus, and to approve investments as some of the seed ideas reach later stages of development.  During this kick-off meeting, I hope to agree on this role for the board, as well as the Xcelerator's overall approach for selecting, staffing and building businesses.

We will work with your assistants to schedule a time for the group to meet, hopefully before the end of August.  If you have any questions or concerns you wish to discuss in advance of that meeting, I would be happy to schedule some time on your calendar.

Thank you in advance for your assistance.  I look forward to working with you.

Sincerely,

"The Morning Market Call - Monday June 18th, 2001."," <<MF June 18th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

On Friday, it was reported that Industrial Production fell by 0.8%  in May,
after falling a downward-revised 0.6% in April. Additionally, Capacity
Utilization fell to 77.4%, its lowest point since August 1983. This data
increases the odds of a 50 basis point interest rate cut from the Federal
Reserve at the June 26/27  meeting.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.68%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.22%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.67%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.82 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.08 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

year. And yet, the stock is trading at 14 times our 02
EPS.
*Fannie Maes monthly number showed strong purchase commitment volume, an
excellent net interest margin and very strong credit.
We are raising our 01 and 02 EPS estimate by $0.05 each.
*OFHEOs annual report was released on June 15, which concluded that FNM
exceeded safety and soundness standards in every
category examined. These categories included credit risk, market risk,
operational risk and corporate governance.

*Following recent sector weakness across the wireless equip. group, we
thought it timely to provide an update on trends at wireless
innovator QUALCOMM. We maintain our 1 Strong Buy.
*While market conditions remain subdued, we believe that demand remains
in-line w/QCOM's modest earnings guidance, revised post
2Q01. We believe revs & EPS in 3Q of $627M & $0.21 remain achievable. 3Q
chipsets likely to be approx. 14M in period, w/range

Rank 2 2
*We are maintaining our Buy rating but reducing our 2002 revenue forecast
and price target.
*EXDS management recognizes the challenges ahead and is making progress on
multiple fronts.
*We believe the 2Q conference call will be critical to reigniting equity
interest in the company.
*Churn peaked in March and has trended down sequentially, however, the macro
environment remains challenging. Therefore, we are
reducing our 2002 revenue forecast from $2.5B to $2.0B and our price target
from $15 to $9.
*EXDS has $1.1 billion in cash and $450 million in remaining bank lines
available. We continue to believe the company will receive
a waiver on its bank line covenants.
*We believe the previously announced cost reductions and lower capex will
allow the company to reach cash flow positive. However,
the company must begin demonstrating progress in 2Q01.

Carnival Corp(CCL) 3 - Market Perform F. Kantor, .212.526.5562
Expecting Downward Revisions for Remainder of the Year
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $26.40 EPS 2000 N/A $1.64 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $35 - 18 EPS 2001 $1.62E $1.62E $1.66E 16.3
Mkt Cap: $15.5B EPS 2002 $1.85E $1.85E $1.93E 14.3
FY: 11/30 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*The current economic overhang coupled with an aggressive capacity build-out
for at least the next 3 years leads us to maintain our
cautious outlook on the industry as a whole.
*CCL reports 2Q01 EPS on Thurs 6/21. Our EPS est of $0.30 vs $0.32 (in line
with the street) assumes a net yield increase of 3%.
Given anecdotes of pricing weakness in the Caribbean, Alaska and Europe, we
believe that our net yield outlook is too high and thus
our cruise revenue est of $1.08bn (vs $845.3MM) is at risk. CCL could meet
our EPS est, though, given lwr op exp per PPCD,
SG&A or interest expense.
*While CCL's 10.5% retreat from its recent high of $30 seems to imply that a
2Q disappointment is factored into the stock, we
maintain that further downward net yield revisions could cause the shares to
trade closer to their July 2000 levels implying a stock
price of $22.

CVS Corp(CVS) 1 - Strong Buy M. Adler, .212.526.7146
Strong Overreaction = Buying Opportunity
OLD NEW STREET P/E

FY: 12/31 Price Target $66 $66
Rank 1 1
*Friday, a sell-side competitor downgraded and lowered estimates on CVS
based on a survey his team conducted. This survey was
conducted to attempt to further explain the recent deceleration in pharmacy
comps that began in March and concluded that shortage
of pharmacy staff and the EPIC pharmacy system were to blame.
*CVS countered these conclusions and stated the weaker flu and allergy
seasons, the lack of blockbuster drugs introduced, and the loss
of a managed care contract all contributed to decelerating pharmacy sales
*While we acknowledge that CVS is experiencing a labor shortage in a number
of its markets, we do not believe this is a new
phenomenon. This is an industry-wide issue that all drug stores are and will
continue to experience into the future.

"Meeting question.","During a recent visit to the EBS Information Security
team, it was realized that during the EBS
""redeployment""  about 75% of their teams resources
were cut, and now with the recent attacks/breakin's on
Enron resources (Routers, servers, clients) are there
any plans to bring that team back up to full
staffing??  It's my understanding that this team had
identified various risks and vulnerabilities in the
past, however without the proper manpower how is EBS
going to ensure security is not overlooked and these
breakin's do not continue?

"Chatting","Jeff,

You and I have spoken a few times in various situations (at the MS, in the elevator, etc...) and I was wondering if you might be interested in sitting down over a Guinness or two sometime and chatting about electricity.  I work in Govt. Affairs, and focus on physical scheduling of energy and transmission at NERC and FERC (remember?  I sent you the picture of Gent in the Enron jersey).  I was thinking it might be interesting to sit down and chat sometime about the issues we're facing in a more ""off the cuff"" casual sort of atmosphere.  Any availability?

"SBSC Issues 40 Page Guide to National Energy Policy History & Options","July 25, 2001


SBSC RELEASES 40 PAGE GUIDE TO
U.S. ENERGY POLICY HISTORY & POLICY OPTIONS

Washington, D.C.-The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) has just
issued a 40 page guide to a successful U.S. energy policy.  The new SBSC
report provides a wealth of energy facts; a history of U.S. energy policy; a
sober assessment of global warming and related proposed policies; a look at
what has gone wrong in states like California; and an assessment of the Bush
administration's energy proposals.

 ""Our energy crisis today is not about a looming depletion of energy
resources, threatened destruction of the environment, wasteful consumers,
greedy energy companies, or even OPEC.  Instead, we are experiencing a
crisis of misguided government rules, regulations, and taxes that have
endangered consumers, businesses of every size and type, U.S.
competitiveness, and the economy,"" said SBSC chief economist Raymond J.
Keating, author of the SBSC report entitled ""Energy Freedom: Lifting
Government Burdens on U.S. Energy Producers & Consumers.""

""Nothing is more crucial to the future of the economy and survival of small
businesses than a successful energy policy,"" said SBSC president Darrell
McKigney.  ""Our goal in this report is to show that providing relief from
regulatory restrictions and red tape, expanding energy exploration and
development, and reducing international trade barriers are the real keys to
successful energy plan.""

The complete 40 page ""Energy Freedom: Lifting Government Burdens on U.S.
Energy Producers & Consumers"" is the latest report in SBSC's ""21st Century
Small Business Policy Series,"" and can be downloaded from the group's
website at www.sbsc.org,  or you can request a printed copy by calling
Priscilla Tacujan at (202) 785-0238.

Author Ray Keating is available for interviews, as is SBSC President Darrell
McKigney.

SBSC is a leading national nonprofit, nonpartisan small business advocacy
group headquartered in Washington, D.C.  For more information, call SBSC at

"An employee from OPO Dabhol.","How I wish all the bosses treat their employees as the man in this story did!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First-Day Employee

My father had a small business, employing approximately fifteen people at any given time.  We pasteurized and homogenized milk from farmers each morning, and put it into bottles for home use and for restaurants.  We also put the milk into small containers for the school kids everyday.  We also made a wonderful little thing called homemade ice cream.  We sold all of these milk products, and many more, in the front of a dairy building, which had been fashioned into a small store with a large soda fountain.  During the summer months, there were rows and rows of eager tourists lined up at the ice cream counter, waiting for their daily indulgence of my father's most exquisite recipes of some twenty-seven flavors of homemade wonder.

Being such an extremely busy little store meant that the employees had to work fast and furious for hours at a time, with little rest.  The swarm of tourists never stopped and our ""rush hour"" lasted many hours on hot days.

I had worked for my father since I was young, as did all seven kids in our family.  So I had seen many new employees come and go due to the fast and frenetic pace. One day, in 1967, we had a new employee, Debbie, who wanted to work in the store for the summer.  She had never done this type of work before, but planned to give it her all.

On her first day, Debbie made just about every mistake in the book.  She added the sales wrong on the cash register, she charged the wrong prices for items, she gave the wrong bag of food to the wrong customer, and she dropped and broke a half-gallon of milk.  The torture of watching her struggle was too much for me.  I went into my father's office and said, ""Please go out there and put her out of her misery.""  I expected him to walk right into the store and fire her on the spot.  Since my father's office was situated within view of the sales counter, he had no doubt seen what I was talking about. He sat, thoughtful, for a moment.  Then he got up from his desk and walked over to Debbie, who was standing behind the counter.

""Debbie,"" he said, as he put his hand gently on her shoulder.  ""I have been watching you all day, and I saw how you treated Mrs. Forbush.""

Debbie's face began to flush and tears began to well in her eyes as she struggled to remember Mrs. Forbush from the many women she had given the wrong change to or spilled milk on.

My father continued, ""I've never seen Mrs. Forbush be so polite to any one of my employees before.  You really knew how to handle her.  I am sure that she is going to want you to wait on her every time she comes in.  Keep up the good work.""

In return for being a wise and compassionate employer, my father got a loyal, and hardworking employee for sixteen years...and a friend for life.

"eThink About It: 07/30/01","


Karen Denne, vice president of Public Relations, received some interesting questions about Enron's dealings with the media in her eSpeak session on July 24.  Here's one of them:

I am new to Enron, and the ""pie in the face"" incident occurred just after I began working here. I have had several friends ask me about that. My questions are: 1) How did we ""spin"" this issue (i.e., the problems with Cal. AND the fact that we got pie thrown on one of our main players) 2) Was he mad about it, or did he laugh it off? 3) Is this a pie incident kind of a good thing, because it gets people talking about the issues and Enron or do we look silly?

Want to know how she responded?  Check out her full eSpeak transcript at http://ethink.enron.com/eSpeak/exec/default.asp.

"Hakluyt & Co Ltd","Dear Mr Skilling,

Your office has asked me to outline Hakluyt's services. Rather than fall back on the usual corporate information that we have sent to your people previously, I would say simply this; Hakluyt is what you make of it - it places an unparalleled  private intelligence  network at the personal disposal of senior commercial figures.

The range of deployments we have completed for core clients is wide. In all cases we guarantee complete confidentiality. And, although we work for divisional directors on tactical issues, we have found our most rewarding work in personal dealings with CEOs who wish - for whatever reason - to have a confidential agency at their own disposal. It was this, which prompted Phil Carroll to write to you about us in April as he has found our work of considerable value to him personally.  We look at people and the issues, which often drive them to make the decisions or act as they do.  All our work is unattributable.

Our ability to generate intelligence is as strong in the developed economies as in the emerging markets, and we have operated in every major industrial, trade and service sector. We have operated in 82 countries to date some involving Brussels/European Union related issues. The recent GE/Honeywell incident is a good example of where we could have provided timely, accurate insights into the agenda and thinking in Brussels.


 We also have an association with Kissinger/McLarty Associates for although our work is very different the services we both provide can be complementary.  Our US client base is increasing well but at the same time we wish to remain small and discreet.

I would be delighted to call on to tell you more about our operations and to discuss how we could be of value to you.  If this is of interest perhaps I could get my office to contact yours to look for a convenient time.

Yours sincerely

"SAB101/Contract Mgmt. Best Practices","
Jeff, 
Contract management has become a big issue in most Fortune 1000 companies because of the risk to market capitalization that obligations in corporate contracts pose. I think that Enron executives would be very interested in the articles hot linked below. I would be glad to spend time with your organization to investigate the impact of enabling contract management best practices at Enron.
diCarta provides the first web-based contract and revenue management solution that enables businesses to negotiate, track, manage, and renew contracts via the Internet.  We have had tremendous success in helping companies like Kraft, BEA Systems, Intuit, Agile, Ernst&Young, Deloitte Consulting and many others gain visibility into their contracting and revenue management processes while  mitigating financial and legal risks.
Below is the diCarta solution overview then links to recent articles including our partnerships with Arthur Andersen and Deloitte.
diCarta's Focus:  diCarta Contracts automates your entire contract lifecycle including negotiations, execution, revenue management, maintenance, and renewals on both the sell-side and buy-side.  Your complete contract information will now be in one central location, on-line, for down-stream revenue, obligation, and renewals management.  This is enabled by a direct link of the unstructured data in the contract to structured data, which allows you to take automatic actions based on the actual contract Ts&Cs.  To maximize communication and efficiency, diCarta Contracts was specifically designed to be a collaborative application using role-based security.  E-signatures are supported as well.
Negotiation:  You can negotiate contract Ts&Cs on-line with an internal approval workflow to manage risk.  Not only will you shorten your quote-to-cash cycle, but reduce your legal and financial risk by having on-line visibility into what Ts&Cs you are approving before the contract is executed.  
Revenue Management:  On the sell-side, you will have a framework for revenue recognition per the FASB and SEC guidelines that is driven directly from the contract Ts&Cs.  Now you can manage your revenue recognition risk, significantly reduce labor, and avoid possible non-compliance.  This is extremely important as companies struggle with adherence to SAB 101.  On the buy-side, you can proactively track expenditures.
  
Renewals:  Since all contract Ts&Cs are captured, your renewal process can be completely automated.  Accurate renewal notices linked to the contract can be sent to your customers, vendors, and/or you on a timely basis.

"Endorsing the Rappaport/Mauboussin book","Jeff,

I hope all is well with you.

Sorry I missed you in NY a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to catch up with
you. Looks and sounds like you are still doing terrific things, and I use
you and Enron a great deal in conveying my message to investors and
managers.

Al Rappaport and I have completed our book, Expectations Investing, which
will be published by Harvard Business School Press in September. (See
attached preface). I'm really excited about the product, and I think you'll
find it interesting as well.

Al and I have asked the publisher to send you a more recent version for your
review. You'll probably get it in the next week or so.

Specifically, we'd be honored if you would endorse our book. The endorsers
we are targeting are a blue chip group, and we feel your perspective would
add a great deal.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give me a shout if you have any
questions.

"June 1 Deep Dive/Houston","Jeff:

The whole team and I very much enjoyed our meeting with you last Friday.  We were looking forward to having the opportunity to tell you all about the progress of our business.  We felt that the give and take and the dialogue during the course of the meeting was excellent, and we hope that in the future we will be able to have useful dialogues like this at appropriately periodic intervals.

To memorialize the follow-up steps from this, we thought it would be useful to write this down so we may remain responsive to your questions regarding our progress.

	1.	We want to confirm the reasonableness of our net churn numbers; we plan to develop a fact base of churn experience over the course of the next few months and analyze these compared to the original business case model.  We would be prepared to review this churn with you in about three months.

	2.	To analyze the rationale of our hedging of long term contracts against the ""disaster"" of falling prices; this is to be done against the assumption that our customers will leave us on the basis of strict economic rationality. We believe that providing this type of analysis would be very useful for us as we enter the year 2002 where power and gas prices will be substantially different next year than they are now.  We would be prepared to review the results of this analysis with you in the fall.

	3.	Decompose our net cash burn to indicate the ""levers"" to reduce that cash burn against unforeseen problems/disasters.  We would plan to do this as part of our normal budgeting process for 2002. We would plan to review this with our Board in our fall meeting. We believe that it is the right course of activity to review this with the Board and then follow up with you if there are any questions going forward.  We also believe that there could be an opportunity to review the cash burn significantly given the fact that a large part of our cash burn is spent on systems development for entry into specific markets.

Jeff, as I said in the beginning, we very enjoyed meeting with you and we hope that we were able to prove to you that we have made substantial progress.  I would like to feel that I will have the opportunity to get in touch with you at key juncture intervals during the development of our company.

Thanks again for your time.

Good Morning.  Pardon the lengthy email, but there's
lots to report.

We had a great meeting this morning, with tremendous
enthusiasm for where we're going.  Please find below a
recap as well as some action items going forward.

We had three companies present:  Metrixx, Molecular
Electronics Corporation, and Telecare International.
Those of you who are interested in attending follow up
meetings were encouraged to sign a sign in sheet with
your email address.  If you are interested in
attending the follow up meetings or receiving details
on the results of those follow ups and did not sign
up, please send an email to Kathy Nethercutt at
knethercutt@houstontech.org, .  Once we have a list of
names, we will forward information specific to each
company to those angels who have indicated interest.
The scheduled meeting times are as follows:

Metrixx:  Monday, 8/20 8:00-10:00 AM
MEC:  Wednesday, 8/22 2:00-4:30
Telecare:  Tuesday, 8/21 7:30-10:00

In the case of Molecular Electronics, please ignore
the $250k minimum.  There are Angels already working
to put together an LLC to pool capital for purposes of
meeting this minimum.

The next HAN Steering Committee meeting is scheduled
for Monday morning, at the Houstonian, from 7:00-9:00
AM in the regular location.  Kerry Brooks will follow
up with a reminder email.  Also, we are working on
putting together a schedule of Steering Committee
meetings so that we can all mark our calendars in
advance.

The next HAN meeting will be on September 19.  The
location of that meeting is yet to be determined, but
will be announced via a follow up email.  In the next
meeting, The Steering Committee will deliver the
following:

**An explanation on the specific structure of HAN as
an organization
**An overview of the deal-flow process and how
companies get presented/moved through to investment
**Details of how HAN will overcome Member liability

Please also note, that HTC will be having an event at
the Houstonian on September 20, for Angels who are
interested in becoming more involved in biotechnology
investment opportunities. Because of our medical
center and the growing, national interest in biotech,
Houston-based Angels are uniquely positioned to take
advantage of these opportunities.  More details will
follow, directly from HTC.

Lastly, I have attached an Angel application in Word
format.  Please feel free to complete/submit the
application electronically to Kathy at HTC.  HTC can
accept payment for the $1,000 membership fee via
credit card, over the telephone.  Remember that those
Angels who apply prior to the end of the next meeting
will have their dues paid through 2002.  Also, please
pass the application on to those ACCREDITED investors
who may be interested in joining or any that you have
already recommended whose contact information may not
be in the HAN database.

Again, I'm looking forward to helping build a great
Network.  Let's keep the momentum going!

An Urgent Message from Dr. Ed Young

Dear church family,
No tragedy has overwhelmed this great city with such depth and breadth
as the flooding we've seen this past week.  Without a doubt, this is a
critical time.  Businesses will recover. The Medical Center will recover.
 The Theater District will recover.?but it's the poorest of the poor?.these
are the people that will find it difficult to recover.  They will suffer
the most.

Sadly we've discovered our city is not prepared for such a crisis.  The
tragedies abound.
These victims are desperately seeking help from agencies of relief like
FEMA, The Red Cross, etc.
Never has there been a time in our city that a need has been so great.

Bottom line: We need you to make a difference.  It's time for vast volunteerism.
 It's time to step up and serve.  Who will stand up and help these thousands
of people in their time of need?
Who will make a difference?

As our church members have gone out into the city in recent days they've
discovered overwhelming circumstances.  We must find a way to stretch our
arms around these needs and make a difference.   How can we make a difference?
 We can't.  But God's people, with God's help can!

Our task is clear:
1. We need to clean up homes
2. We need to discern their needs and provide necessary supplies
3. We need to provide the basic assistance to get them back on their feet
including flooring, refrigerators, fans, bedding?basic necessities.

How will we accomplish this?

First of all, it will require sacrifice from all of us working together.
 Starting immediately, we're asking people (high school & older) to come
join a work team.  If you can help, meet at the church anytime after 8:00
a.m. Wednesday through Saturday.  Bring water, work gloves, a sack lunch,
and dress ready to work.  Each team of ten or so will have a team captain
to lead you.

For more details, call 713.365-8600.

Secondly, our Mayor has asked our church to coordinate corporate and private
initiatives in the city to adopt families in need, create a link to individual
home owners (non-insured) or residents of an entire city block.  Already
Conoco, Enron, and Gallery Furniture have joined the effort.  We're praying
for more to step up to the plate.

Finally, we have a great need for supplies. Please visit  http://www.second.org
for a list of needed supplies and for locations to drop off clothing.

This is the moment we can touch this city for Christ.  Let me thank you
in advance for the contributions you will make.  I know I can count on
our Second family to make a difference and give these precious people a
second chance.


It's time to Make a Difference!
Ed Young

For You have been a refuge for the poor, a refuge  for the needy in his
distress, a shelter  from the storm and a shade from the heat?Isaiah 25:

"FW: 308 Information Request","The attached word document is the revised Clean Water Act Section 308 information request that is addressed to Mr. Skilling. The original document, which was received on or about July 9, incorrectly refers to Enron Corp. as Williams Companies, Inc. in the body of the information request. During my conversation with the EPA staff lawyers, they apologized for the error and stated that Enron obviously was not the only recipient of the Section 308 request. During the conversation, a staff lawyer also indicated that EPA would be receptive to granting an extension to the 30-day response time provided in the information request. This and other issues will be addressed with the agency once team members responsible for preparing the response have been identified by management.

Mr. Nutt,

Per my voice mail and your request, enclosed please find an electronic copy

conversation with my colleague, Cheryl Rose, that it will only cause
greater confusion if we resend the Information Request to all recipients of
the July 2, 2001 version.  Thus, a hardcopy of the document only is being

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Again, we appreciate your cooperation.

"Re: PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Subject:	Gray Davis' latest

CA, under Gray Davis leadership, has been buying power at roughly $135 per megawatt hour.  Because CA has no real experience in the business of buying and selling power, they've bought far too much and been forced to dump their power glut back on the market for as little as $1-15.

Gov. Davis reaction, ""Who cares.  That's just minutiae.""

RosettaMed, Inc.

RosettaMed is an inovative software company whose business is creating and
marketing products that electronically link patients, physicians and
clinical databases to improve healthcare communications, efficiency,
outcomes, quality and satisfaction.  There is little doubt that nearly all
medical records will become electronic this decade.  Recent reports from the
Institute of Medicine and bills in the US Senate and State legislatures
foretell the coming revolution in clinical documentation.  The previous
decade showed that transitioning to EMRs is painful for physicians and their
organizations.  RosettaMed products will alleviate the pain by enabling
faster, more accurate and complete documentation that supports both higher
quality care and higher reimbursement for the physician.

The Windjammer system is a method for processing and packaging fresh meat at

"Quicksilver Resources","Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

"","Hi Jeff, hope the weekend was great.

With all the management and business changes in the organization the last few months, it might not be a bad idea to get everyone (say OOC at business units and higher, or like the old EI/ENA MD meeting in Cabo) to an offsite to do business reviews, and do some strategy work.  I certainly wouldn't mind getting away and talking to everyone for a couple of days.

"Enron and  TVA  Jointly Demonstrate a New NOx Reduction Technology","Mr. Lay-

I recently attended TVA's June Board meeting where the TVA Board tentatively approved a transaction with EGM to demonstrate an innovative, new NOx reduction technology (NOxTech) to which EGM holds the exclusive, world-wide license.  While there, I met Mr. Glen McCullough, one of the TVA Directors.  He asked me to send his best wishes to you.

Although the technology has been tested on a small-scale,  this would be the first full-scale installation.  Our demonstration with TVA should be completed in early 2002 and if successful,  we plan to market it as an alternative to Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) to reduce NOx from coal-fired generation. 

TVA seems excited about the prospect of teaming with Enron to demonstrate this new NOx reduction technology.

"Looking forward to working with you","
Jeff &  Greg
 
Thank you  for your offer to work with you to build the Xcelerator.  We made  my acceptance official today, and am looking forward to building successful  businesses with the team at Enron.  I will be happy to begin in Houston  this Monday the 9th if you think it is important that we get started  immediately, otherwise I'll take a few days to get things settled before  starting work the following week on Monday the 16th.  Please let me know if  you have a strong preference.
 
In addition, if  there are any materials that I could review before arriving to better  understand what ground has been covered by the Xcelerator and other growth  initiatives, or to better understand Enron in general, then I would appreciate  the chance to review them if you can direct me to the  source.
 
Thanks again for  this wonderful opportunity.  I'm looking forward to making it a  success.

"Enron Expatriates in India","John Brindle, David Cromley and others in the Corporate Business Controls group (formerly part of EBS) have been working over the last several weeks to make sure that we can get our people out of Dabhol if there are threats to their safety.  While no plan is perfectly reliable (particularly during monsoon season) we believe that we are as ready as we can be.

Subject:	Enron Expatriates in India

Steve,

I wanted to give you the latest figures on Enron expatriates in India.  There are currently 19 Enron expatriate employees based in India, accompanied by six dependants.  In addition, Enron has responsibility for 15 expatriate contractors working for DPC and Lingtec, primarily at Dabhol.  The total of 40 expatriates for whom Enron is directly responsible is broken down by location as follows:  21 in Mumbai, 16 at Dabhol, and three in Baroda.  By company, they are broken down as follows:  Enron India -  eight plus three dependants; EOGIL - nine plus one dependant; EBS - one plus two dependants; DPC - seven; and Lingtec - nine.  These figures are likely to continue to trend downward; Jane Wilson's departure on Friday, for example, will reduce the Enron India expatriate presence to seven plus three dependants.

We are confident that the evacuation plan now in place provides the best possible prospect of successfully evacuating all of these expatriates in the event of danger.  As a contingency, the plan also includes the evacuation of all 137 expatriates working at the Dabhol site, although a large-scale evacuation from Dabhol is more problematic, especially now that the monsoon season has started.  A coordinated plan was needed since the limited number of available helicopters meant that the evacuation plans drawn up by individual contractors such as Bechtel were all drawing upon the same resources.

As you know, Enron's security situation in India remains stable.  We are in the final stages of implementing security upgrades for our employees and offices there.

Dave

"New Risk Management Policy","
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries (the ""Company"") are exposed to market, credit, operational and liquidity/funding risks in the normal course of its business activities.  The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the ""Policy"") on August 14, 2001.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposure to risks shall be evaluated, managed and controlled, and pursuant to which capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy focuses on four major types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks shall be managed on a portfolio basis for standard transactions via various market risk limit structures and credit approval processes, and for non-standard transactions via the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval Process.   This Policy provides an overview of various risk measurement tools and limits to be applied to these risks, and the roles and responsibilities for the key participants of the risk management framework.  

Management and employees are responsible for complying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in this Policy, available at http://home.enron.com/resources.  Following an initial transiton period, various individuals within the key functions participating in the Company's risk management framework will be required to sign a Compliance Certificate, an example of which is attached to the Policy as Appendix H.

If you have any questions, please contact Cassandra Schultz, cassandra.schultz@enron.com, 713-853-0429 who will put you in touch with the appropriate Risk Assessment & Control representative.

"Image of Enron in India","
Respected Sir,   
I'd worked with Enron India for 18 months and I'd admired the company for quite some time. Finally I got the opportunity to work with Enron in India and being an Indian I thought it would be privilege for me to serve my home country working in such a respectable company. I really enjoyed my stay but I found Enron India opposite to my belief. I would like to share with you few experience to help you take some steps to safeguard the image of the organization and prevent its further damage.
 
?        There has been no standard policy for anything like travel, compensation, accounts and few old anchors of Enron India who were having very close proximity with CEO (Sanjay) had been enjoying the kingdom with their own methods. 
?        New Delhi office has been the best example of high level of unprofessionally and corruption especially in office Administration where concerned executive used to take undue advantage of the strong relationship with CEO and lack of procedures and guidelines. I'd seen Admin Manger misusing office cars, mobile phones in abundance.
?        Being a liaison office and less proximity from Mumbai office, a Sr. VP had created a well protected fort where nobody could raise any resistance even if one clearly just to realize that these people have so strong roots.
?        Admin person used to take all kinds of favors to give them orders despite better competitors. This includes AC contractor, CAR dealers, carpenters and other office suppliers.
?        An admin Manager (Jaya Kumar) has got assets worth three times whole life compensation is worth considering to prove the fact the all is not well with Enron India with so many such people around. 
?        Although lots of improvement has been done during the past 4-5 months by HR and present CEO (WADE) but still these people could survive and instrumental in leaking confidential information to ex-CEO/Media and making good money.
 
I believe Enron is a very reputed and professional organization and my sentiments are still the same but considering the sensitivity of situation under current circumstances, somebody should keep a watch on Sr. VP and Admin Manager duo who had been together for almost 8 years (They were together even before joining Enron India) and audit all the transaction done by them for the last couple of years.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

A well wisher and admirer for Enron

Today's LA Times editorial  revived the Lockyer quote.  It is remarkable (and troubling for Enron)  that Lockyer's political peers / rivals have not taken  him to task for his outrageous remark; nor have the major  newspapers.  In Today's editorial, the usually conservative LA Times  refers to Lockyer as having ""boosted the rhetoric a notch.""  (I'd hate  to witness two or three notches.)
 
This lack of  criticism could foreshadow a contagious attitude that powerful Enron is in  fact the one to blame (facts be damned).  Given Enron's high profile policy  and fundraising ties to the Bush administration and Governor Gray  Davis' war with President Bush and Texas energy companies, there could be  more turbulence ahead.  Fasten your seatbelts and be on the  ready.

In his State of the State address last  January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the big private electric power generators  of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if  necessary. Then he really got angry, calling them ""the biggest snakes in  the world."" This past week, Atty. Gen.

Meanwhile, President Bush and  Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for causing its own  problems with a ""harebrained"" deregulation scheme and mocked the state's  power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. Now it's time  for our leaders to act like adults.        Davis and Bush always will have their  political differences, but the economies of both the state and the nation  are endangered by California's energy situation. These leaders need to  work together as cooperatively as possible, starting next week when Bush  makes his first visit to California as president.        Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to  meet with him during his California visit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer  said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues.  Good start. Let's hope the conversation is civil and that the civility  spreads.       No matter how much California  has been abused by the power companies, and it absolutely has, the state  still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric  power generation this year and next. Usually, the biggest targets of  official and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this  time because, in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry  by the power generators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over  the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more  credit to Edison and PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the  threatening rhetoric needs to subside.        State lawmakers are right to be upset  with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable  temporary wholesale price controls. And Davis is justifiably upset with  Bush and with Cheney, who said the only solution was to build more power  plants--ignoring the fact that the state is building 10 plants now, with  five more on the way, and that the only way to control wholesale power  rates is for Washington to cap them.       If  the state hadn't bought the power, the generators would have let the  lights go out. Davis needs to deliver that message, quietly and  persuasively, while Bush is in California. And Bush needs to listen  respectfully, like an adult.   [IMAGE]Search the archives  of the Los  Angeles Times for similar stories.

"Accomplishments-June 2001","Guys
 
I am currently on vacation and unable to deliver this in person.  However, as PRC approaches I thought it would be useful to forward to you a few of my accomplishments thus far in 2001 besides being able to take vacation:
 
1.  EIM has overachieved its income targets for the first half of the year and is on track to overachieve the entire year.
 
2..  We have built a recurring commodity based wholesale business in forest products and steel that has many years to run with significant growth opportunities.
 
3.  Learning from other start up business units, we are building EIM at a reasoned pace and ensuring that costs appropriately reflect profit opportunites.
 
4.  EIM enters its second year of existence and its second year of profitability.
 
5.  We have made a significant impact on the two industries and remain the topic of conversation in most industry circles.
 
6.  EIM has successfully built a coordinated team effort and has successfully redeployed many key Enron personnel into value creation positions.
 
7.  Having made an impact in N America, the European team is under construction and is expected to be profitable by the end of the year, its first year of existence.
 
8.  I am the executive lead on the Vanderbilt recruiting effort and since my involvement, Vanderbilt is the most successful school we recruit from (cost per student and percentage of acceptances).
 
9.  I remain extremely involved in the mentor program and meet with my mentee of 3 years regularly.  In spite of my advice, he still seems to be progressing within the company!
 
10.  I believe I communicate the necessary information to senior management without burdening you with trivial details to utilize your time effectively.
 
Aloha!

"RE: Flood Relief","
Please allow me to take a moment to express our my gratitude to Enron for assisting us (my wife, 2 daughters and me) in our desperate time of need.  Although many in Houston were affected by Tropical Storm Allison to a degree worse than we, still we were in dire need of help.  Enron, the outstanding company that it is, came through for us.

My family and I have been displaced from our home, and the sum total of our worldly possessions now fit inside 1 half of a 2-car garage.  Enron has helped us begin to put our lives back together, and I can think of no more eloquent or appropriate way to express our gratitude than to simply say, ""Thank you.""

The immense pride I feel being a part of the most innovative company in the world has increased 10 fold.

My most sincere thanks,

Keith Clark

"Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast and Solicitation","
As we prepare for the kick-off of Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign, Building Houston's Future, we are asking our top-level executives to set the standard of giving during the Leadership Giving Campaign that will run from July 23 through August 3.

The decision to focus this year's campaign on Building Houston's Future came directly from our employees, who rallied to help Houston recover from the flood damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison. Enron employees have expressed a strong desire to continue assisting those in need until our city fully recovers, so our adopted agencies were selected with flood relief in mind. Each business unit is also adopting United Way Scholars students, who will participate in the Days of Caring. United Way Scholars builds Houston's future business leaders by targeting talented students who may be overlooked by other scholarship programs.

Last year, your generosity took Enron to new heights. We raised $2.8 million, which was 21 percent higher than our original goal. In order for Enron to achieve even greater success this year, we invite you to join us in becoming a member of the prestigious Alexis de Tocqueville Society by making a pledge of $10,000 or more to United Way.  

You are invited to join us at an Alexis de Tocqueville Breakfast on Tuesday, July 31 from 7:30 a.m. - 9 a.m. to learn more about the Society and hear about Enron's 2001 United Way Campaign plans.

The Breakfast will be held at the Center for the Retarded at 3550 West Dallas. Center for the Retarded is one of Enron's four adopted agencies for the 2001 campaign. Transportation from the Enron Building to The Center will be provided; however, if you prefer to drive yourself, we will send out directions a few days prior to the breakfast. Please RSVP to Zulie Flores at ext. 3-3908 or zulie.flores@enron.com by Thursday July 26.

Leadership giving solicitation officially begins on Monday, July 23, so look for an e-mail on Monday morning with more information about the overall campaign and how to make your pledge on-line. If you have any questions about the Alexis de Toqueville Society, or about this year's campaign, please contact Kathy Mayfield, Enron's United Way Campaign Coordinator, at 713-853-3264 or Kathy.Mayfield@enron.com. 

At 49 Society members last year, Enron had the highest number of members in the city, and ranked nationally in the top 25 companies for total membership. We want to thank you for your generosity as this truly indicates how giving each of you are. 

Your support is needed more than ever and is the key to surpassing our campaign goals for 2001. We look forward to seeing you at breakfast on the 31st.

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online -- 7/23/2001","
KUDLOW'S TAKE
By Lawrence Kudlow

TEMPERING THE TERMINATOR
There's more to making money, Alan.


July 23, 2001 8:35 a.m.



Alan Greenspan went through his Terminator III act last week, pledging to
the Congress and the nation that he and the Federal Reserve will do all that
it takes to finance economic recovery. Of course, the heavyweight central
banker has already reneged on his earlier forecast that recovery would come
in the second half. It's now July, which begins the second half, and there
is no recovery.

And, in a rare moment of candor, he told the House Financial Services
Committee that the U.S. economy is ""not out of the woods yet."" So the great
monetary leader left the door wide open for additional easing moves.

During his testimony Greenspan was especially proud of Fed efforts to
reignite money-supply growth as a pro-recovery measure. This is a good
thing, because it was the Fed's massive deflation of money last year that
completely leveled the stock markets and put us in the fix we are in today.

The trouble with all this macho money-creation is that you can lead a horse
to water but you can't make him drink. While the Fed is beginning to pump
more high-powered cash into the economy, a public that is still reeling from
the after-effects of stock-market shock refuses to put any of that money to
productive use in the economy. Investors recoiling from a vicious 70% NASDAQ
drop, and an even worse total wipe out of the dot-coms, are not yet willing
to take any economic risks. As a result, things like venture-capital funds
and initial public offerings - the capital-investment seed corn that funds
the most innovative and risky new enterprises necessary to move the country
to the next level of technology-driven prosperity - aren't being financed.
Nobody, it seems, wants to commit the first new dollar. This is what John
Maynard Keynes meant when he talked about sagging animal spirits in the
1930s.

So where's all the Fed's new cash going? Money-market funds, where savers
get a risk-free, guaranteed return.

Year to date, retail and institutional money funds are rising at an
eye-popping 38% annual rate, or just about $50 billion a month. This is more
than twice last year's pace. Trouble is, this sort of investment is
basically for little old ladies in tennis shoes. It's not the aggressive,
high-tech, entrepreneurial risk taking that will fund the next great idea,
the one that could transform the economy and increase productivity. Until
this moss-covered, risk-averse psychology changes, the Fed can drop interest
rates to zero and dump cash into the economy by the wheelbarrow. But the
economy will not improve.

So how might government policy makers turn this story around? If they
provided new tax-cut incentives for investment, they might just unlock
risk-taking spirits and get the Fed's money working productively in the
economy. The odd part about Bush's tax-cut plan is that the expected flood
of rebates this year is designed to stimulate consumer spending; the
investment incentive-effects from lower tax rates don't kick in for another
4-5 years. But consumer spending isn't the problem. In fact, that's the only
area keeping us out of recession. It's the collapse of business-investment
spending that has been the principal economic illness - especially
technology-related investments which have completely dried up.

Policy makers should be focused on the supply side of the economy, not the
demand side. ""Clever use of further tax cuts - this time to encourage
capital spending - may help prevent those widespread job cuts that would
ultimately guarantee a recession,"" writes Brian Nottage of The Dismal
Scientist. Nottage recommends accelerated depreciation allowances that would
permit a quick write-off for companies investing in new equipment.

This is exactly what former Reagan Treasury advisor Steve Entin supports.
Mr. Entin is backing the High Productivity Investment Act, a bi-partisan
bill crafted by Reps. Phillip English (R., Pa.), and Richard Neal (D.,
Mass.). This measure would let businesses claim the full cost of their
investment in high-tech equipment as a business expense in the year it was
purchased, and would also shorten the time period for all other equipment
purchases. According to Entin, faster write-offs would ""lower the cost of
utilizing equipment and increase capital formation, resulting in higher
labor productivity, real wages, and employment.""

Another tax-cut measure that would surely reawaken investment spirits would
be a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. ""An increase in the
after-tax return of investing in securities also implies a decrease in the
expected profits investors require from currently hurting companies,"" writes
the dismal scientist, Mr. Nottage.

The self-financing capital-gains tax cut in the mid-1990s provided a booster
rocket to stock markets and economic growth.

Investment tax cuts would encourage savers to take new risks and would put
Fed money creation to real work. Whenever after-tax rewards are sweetened,
more investment is sure to follow. With energy costs coming down, along with
lower inflation and interest rates, the sickly economy will surely mend over
time. But the question is how quickly and at what pace will this economic
mending occur.

A new round of investment tax cuts will give Terminator III Greenspan some
real clout.

"Africa","Jeff:
My name is Tom Mashington and I'm a Construction Project Manager for EES in their Philadelphia office. A few weeks ago, I received in the mail a Enron newsletter which contained a feature of you and your interests. While reading the article, I noticed that you're into ""Anything Africa."" Two years ago, I was working in Ghana, West Africa on a cogen plant with Stone & Webster. Most US. citizens have no idea what the conditions are like in these 3rd world countries. 
I was curious as to how many trips you've made to the sub-Saharan section of the continent and to which countries you have visited.
Earlier, I was discussing my African experience with Marty Sunde. I sent him a few ebony wood carvings purchased from the local villagers. These pieces were hand carved by artisans in the area.  If you have a moment, you should stop by his office on the 8th floor where he has them on display.
I have also attached the files containing a few digital photo's from the area where I lived and worked. These are primarily photos from the local villages near the plant.
While you're viewing the photos, you should be able to recognize me. I'm the only American looking individual in the tribe.
Enjoy

Tom Mashington

"NEXT TRILLION","lou,

per our last conversation, i have a deal we wanted to get in front of you...

namely, would Enron be interested in helping set up a global market for
private equity... much like you've done in electricity, gas, broadband?
it's close to a $1T market and growing rapidly.  we think it would change
everything.

i'd like to set up a time to come down to houston and compare notes.

let me know what you can do.

all the best,
