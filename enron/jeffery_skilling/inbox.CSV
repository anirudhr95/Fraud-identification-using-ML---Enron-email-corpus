Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the ""right skills"".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

"Re: Michael Milken","Jeff,

     As I mentioned at our last meeting, we have invited Michael Milken to
speak at the Key Executive breakfast that the chapter is having in November.
I've attached a copy of the invitation letter.  Upon checking in with
Michael's assistant, I said that you offered to phone Michael personally to
get him to attend and I also mentioned Ken's name.

     I just received a call from Jeffrey Moore who handles the scheduling of
all of Michael's speeches.  He said Michael gets 20 requests a week and
usually accepts one of them at most.  Many requests are from YPO chapters.
The reason he was calling me was to say under normal circumstances Michael
wouldn't consider coming to Houston, even for a YPO event, but what gave him
pause was you.

     After I gave him all of the reasons why Michael should come, he said it
would still not be enough to justify the trip.  However, he said, if Jeff
Skilling were to introduce Michael to the group, that would greatly increase
the probability that Michael would accept.  I told him that you would be
happy to introduce him and reiterated your offer to call.  He said that was
not necessary and that he would talk with Michael this weekend and get back
to me next week.

     There is nothing further that needs to be done at this point, but I
just wanted to keep you up to date in case you received a phone call from
Jeffrey or Michael.  Thanks for the help and I'll keep you updated on our
progress.

Mark

"[smu-betas] Review of Dent's book on Amazon.com","
Customer  Reviews
Avg. Customer Review: 5.0 out of 5 starsWrite an online review   and share your thoughts with other customers. 
5 out of 5 stars A great book about a great team., August 27,  2001 
Reviewer: A reader from Dallas, TX USA  
Jim  Dent's Junction Boys was one of the greatest sports books I ever read, so I  couldn't wait for his next one. It's a different kind of story, but this book is  wonderful too. Dent knows how to make his characters come alive, from the great  coach, Bud Wilkinson, to all those great players, and there were quite a few  during the Streak. No, Wilkinson isn't portrayed as a saint here, because he  wasn't--he was a human being, and that's how Dent shows him, warts and all. I'd  rather read the truth, and if John Herman Bell says ""this book is as true as  true can be"" (that's what he told the Daily Oklahoman), that's good enough for  me. The best part of the book is getting to know all those great players, and  reading about all those great games they played--and there were some great  games. Also, getting behind the scenes is really cool, to see how the players  and the coaches prepared (or didn't). There are a lot of funny stories, too. All  in all, a great follow-up to the great Junction Boys.

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online Financial -- September 7, 2001","KUDLOW'S TAKE
by Lawrence Kudlow



HEY GEORGE, ANYTHING NEW?
No news is bad news as far as Wall Street is concerned.



President Bush came outside the White House at 3 p.m. Friday afternoon to
talk about the devastating job report published in the morning. The report
had recession written all over it -- including the highest unemployment rate
in four years. Bush stood in front of the podium, flanked by House Speaker
Denny Hastert and Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, and showed some
Clinton-era ""I feel your pain"" in a discussion of the nation's deteriorating
economy. The trouble was, the president had nothing new to say.

Though both Lott and Hastert are proposing a capital-gains tax cut to lift
business investment out of its doldrums, the president never once mentioned
cap-gains. Instead, he repeated his mantra that the new budget under
discussion must be disciplined, the so-called Social Security surpluses must
not be invaded, and his energy plan should be passed.

Because he announced no new stimulus, stock markets sagged as the
presidential news conference went on. No news is bad news as far as Wall
Street is concerned.

The economic story is turning out far worse than anyone expected at the Fed
or the administration. Stock markets are looking for some supply-side relief
to lower the tax cost of production and investment, and improve incentive
rewards for capital risk taking. But nothing is forthcoming in the way of
new presidential policies.

One key reason for the lack of new tax initiatives is that top presidential
advisors do not agree with Lott and Hastert. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill
is travelling through the country telling folks that he doesn't believe
cap-gains relief will promote economic growth. Earlier in the year, he
argued that corporations don't adjust their planning on the basis of tax
policy. Last week, he asserted that the nation cannot afford a cap-gains
cut, despite decades of historical evidence that revenues rise when the
cap-gains tax rate falls.

Top Bush economic advisor Larry Lindsey has not ruled out a cap-gains cut,
but Lindsey continues to tout the consumer tax rebate as a demand-side
measure to stimulate growth.

The Bushies are not entirely to blame for the policy stalemate in
Washington. Leading Democrats such as Senate budget committee chairman Kent
Conrad, lately joined by Sen. Hillary Clinton, have been ranting and raving
about protecting Social Security surpluses. This time-tested Democratic
Social Security scare tactic, normally reserved for the waning days of an
election, has been hauled out in the middle of the worst stock market in
nearly 20 years.

Daschle, Conrad, Clinton & Co. are arguing that declining budget surpluses
are causing the economic slump. Factually, however, the true causality is
exactly the reverse. You don't have to be a supply sider to understand that
it's the slumping economy with fewer people working that is bringing down
the surplus.

But there's a way around this rhetoric. The Bush administration has to get
to work by reaching out to Democratic tax cutters like Zell Miller and John
Breaux to create a bipartisan coalition that will go behind the back of the
Democratic leadership in order to rescue the economy.

Without a supply-side plan to promote capital formation and more generous
equipment expensing allowances, stock markets will continue to rely on the
next round of Fed easing for any relief. Incredibly, not a peep was heard
from the central bank after Friday's disappointing unemployment report. The
Fed needs to drop its policy target rate by 50 basis points immediately, and
then come back with another 50 at their next meeting in October.

Unfortunately, Washington continues to fiddle while the stock market and
economy burn.

I feel the less compunction in intruding to your kind
heartedness; I have been noted about your reputable
existence and I consequently reposed in you the most
esteemed confidence, it is with trust and
uncompromising faith that I humbly herein to disclose
this personal confidential issue to you.
I am a management consultants based  in the Republic
of the Gambia representing businessmen in the western
coast of Africa with extensive clientele.
Note,the current  president of the Gambia, (President
Yaya .A.Jammeh) is a close friend of mine.
Due to the on-going presidential election in the
country and focus on the strong pressure given to him
by his opposition, he requested that I should  assist
in sourcing for a reliable individual/company anywhere
in the world in order to transact the sum of
($19.6Million USDollars) which is in his possession.
He has of course decided to make good use of the fund
because he don't know if he will win the election or
not.Please kindly help us out of this impasse, and I
sincerely hope you will not deny us this wish.
Note,there is practically no risk involved in this
issue, healthy arrangment have been made before I
contacted you.
I f you need  any question,do not hesitate to ask. I
will be very grateful to hear from you as urgently as
you can.

"Re: PEER GROUP MAPPING","Steve Kean and I believe quite strongly, within a four peer group structure,  that we need to allocate somewhere between 30 and 50 percent of Gov't./ public  Affairs out of commercial support into specialized technical- there is a clear divide between individuals in the Gov't/public  Affairs groups  who are managing significant risk for the company and having a significant and  direct impact on commercial activities/ net income( these individuals should be moved to specialized technical)....and others who are performing a less strategic function( who should remain in the commercial support category). With that said, it is probably not necessary to undertake this effort for  mid-year PRC purposes since we are probably moving to a three peer stucture where that split could be achieved (for year-end purposes where the compensation impact would be felt). If we stay with the four group stucture, I intend to push hard for the remapping of Gov't Affairs by year-end.
    On a completely seperate issue, I continue to be  very concerned about the impact of the ""preferred"" distribution  relative to the bottom category for "" commercial support"" groups(I'm not implying this is'nt an issue for commercial groups- I just don't have the same ability to assess the impact there)....the concern, simply stated,  is that  it may be entirely  counterproductive to force individuals who are not performance problems  into a category that has significant implications for their careers here at Enron, particularly after going thru the past year where many of the non-performers in my group and others  were moved out of the company- the replacement costs for moving good performers out of the company for the sake of a ""preferred"" distribution are quite high...and that is even before you begin  to assess the incalcuable damage to morale that will invariably occour.
       Thanks.

Subject:	PEER GROUP MAPPING

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

Following is a clarification note that I forwarded to Whalley this AM.


Thanks - Dan

To:	Dan Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES

Subject:	UC/CSU Procedural Next Steps

As you know, UC/CSU sued us for breach of contract in March.  At the same time they moved for a preliminary injunction to restore them to direct access during the pendency of the case.  The district court granted their motion and issued the preliminary injunction.  We appealed the granting of a preliminary injunction in these circumstances, and, in addition, asked the Court of Appeals to stay the effect of the district court's order until our appeal could be heard.

The Court of Appeals granted our request for a stay.  Because of the similarity beween the legal tests for granting a stay and for granting of preliminary injunction, to grant the stay the Court of Appeals necessarily had to find, at least preliminarily, that the district court likely erred in granting the preliminary injunction.  This is why we think we will win our appeal, especially if it is heard by the same panel.  (Whether or not it is heard by the same panel depends on the clerk of the Court of Appeals and the schedules of the judges.)

We filed our brief in support of our appeal on May 14.  UC/CSU's and the AG's answering briefs must be filed by June 11.  Our reply brief is due 14 days after their briefs are filed.  The appeal is then referred to a 3-judge panel.  Oral argument is usually allowed.

If we win the appeal, UC/CSU campuses in PG&E and SCE territory remain on utililty service until a final decision is made in the case.   If we lose the appeal, we have to take them back until a final decision in made in the case.  The appeal relates only to the preliminary injunction.  The breach of contract action remains to be tried at the district court level.  

The contract expires March 31, 2002.  In the ordinary course a final decision in the case would not be made by then.  The judge, however, could expedite the proceedings so that a decision could be made earlier.  UC/CSU could also move for summary judgment, arguing that that facts are not in dispute and that the judge should rule without a trial.  In either event, it would seem unlikely that a final decision even on a expedited basis could be handed down before late fall/winter.

Please call me with any questions.  Thanks.

"Organizational Announcement","
It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","alDentiii, JaDrow:

I applaud your additions and input!  He's right, Woody.
And he doesn't need me to say that, either, but I wish I had thought of what he added first!

The B.F. (Black Fraternity, what are the Greek letters?) holds most of the cards in this scenario.  Therefore, whoever the intermediary is is excruciatingly important vis-a-vis credibility with local Auburn parties as well as the National fraternities.

Bottom line:  Can everybody (including the polka-dotted people) step outside of their stereotypical roles for a minute and make a statement to their unborn sons and daughters that racism of all colors ends with our generation?  (Shocking coming from a Republican)  Or is this just another news story, another missed opportunity?  After all, we went to SMU for the same reason they are at Auburn now.  Most of us are or will be amused to look back at some of the unexpected sources of the lessons learned.

Can you tell that my profession is very close to this question more often than all of its members wish to admit?

Jeff and Andy,

Thank you for your time yesterday.  The meeting went well and I believe we now have a lot of momentum to move forward on all fronts.

I met with Felicia Garland today to recap the meeting and want to summarize for you both:

	Broadband: Felicia met with Kim Godfrey, EBS, this morning as well and they are moving forward to get a meeting set up to get David Cox and John Echols
		in front of Bob Golden and others who make operational decisions within Pru.  

	RAC meeting:  Felicia and I went through the list of who Enron would bring to the table and she is going to confer with Matt Chanin regarding who Pru would bring and 		determine the best location and time for the meeting.  

		We expect that both of these meetings will not happen until July.

	Voluntary Platform (or Working Solutions):  A meeting is scheduled for this Thursday with Pru and Jennifer Medcalf (Enron Global Strategic Sourcing), Sarah Davis 		and Cynthia Barrow (both with Enron HR).  Andy, if you feel it is appropriate, a call to Cynthia Barrow might be helpful.

	New Power Company:  Felicia is very excited about including a ""portal"" for NPW in their voluntary platform and would also like to possibly extend that to their 			corporate relocation platform.  Andy, let me know the best way to proceed after you call Gene Lockhart. 

	Corporate Relocation:  We didn't talk much about this yesterday but Felicia is going to pursue Pru offering their services to Enron.  She will contact Jennifer Medcalf 		to get an introduction to the appropriate person.

Again, thank you for being available yesterday.

Shirley

     Friday, October 19, 2001 Issue 39   EDITORIAL  Weathering Risk   This week's Briefing is concerned with risk, chiefly that presented by weather in the face of newly deregulated (re-regulated?) energy markets.  Our main feature explains how susceptible the industry has become to increasingly volatile weather, and how the plethora of risks which become presented (include those directly related to earnings) can be alleviated by trading a portfolio of weather derivatives.  We also outline some of the companies who are already emerging as major players in what is already becoming an essential tool for managing financial risk.   On a broader note, our second feature outlines approaches to managing risk in general, and how energy companies can identify and consolidate new opportunities, and reap real financial benefit from minimal risk.   Also, this week saw Eyeforenergy's conference in Singapore, which has been a resounding success.  In a future issue of the Briefing, we will bring you details of events as they unfolded at this three-day meeting of some of the most influential and forward-thinking companies and organizations in the Asian energy market.  For now, you can apply for unlimited access to the speakers' presentations at this conference - more details are available here .   -- Bruno Russell, Acting Editor      FOCUS   Weather is Risky Business for Energy Providers   The pathway to economic oblivion is paved with the bleached bones of those that failed to manage risk. It has been said that economic history is the history of people learning to manage risk. As deregulation takes root, power providers are spreading their reach to the far corners of the globe, in an effort to minimize their risk in any given market.  You don't need a quick trip to Las Vegas to realize that the laws of probability are alive and well in the energy sector. Even the most basic of economic indicators; things that once seemed unpredictable, crop harvest, storms, war, famine, the flow of capital can all be forecast with some degree... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Managing Risk, ""That Old Black Magic""   Headlines coming out of the energy sector are hard to escape. One company reports record profits, another record losses, another goes belly up, yet even more merge, acquire, form alliances, expand, contract and jockey for position as deregulation and increasing competition in energy markets thrust them from a historically stable, low risk environment into a brave new world, full of ever changing risk and opportunities.  Add to the mix shareholders screaming for more profits, consumers demanding lower prices, regulators hell bent on proving deregulation is a myth; there is only re-regulation in a new world order. With this dislocation, the first issue for shareholders and managers of the affected companies to come...

Dear Jeff:
 
We met at the World Economic Forum several weeks ago,  discussing Enron's interest in emissions trading, both SO2 and eventually CO2, a  subject in which I am engaged with other energy firms. I didn't get a chance to  mention that I've followed Indian energy since my posting as economic counselor  at the Delhi embassy in the mid-90's; I knew Joe Sutton quite well, as well as  many of your other folks. 
 
The news today about all the political maneuvering in regard  to Dabhol reminded me that I had wanted to offer my sympathetic and reasonably  knowledgeable support as you and your team cope with the issues, including  conciliation and a possible renegotiation. You have no scarcity of people on  this thorny subject, but I do have both a decade's perspective and excellent  current access to decisionmakers out there.

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online Financial -- September 7, 2001","KUDLOW'S TAKE
by Lawrence Kudlow


MARKET YOUR CALENDAR
Washington needs to come to its senses.



Economic recovery is just around the corner, if you're to believe leading
officials at the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the White House. By
""recovery"" they mean a 3% growth rate next year, with high expectations that
clear rebound evidence will surface during this year's fourth quarter. But
judging by the continued stock-market plunge, the public is not buying what
the government is selling.

This has been one of the worst summer stock markets in recent history. The
much-heralded summer rally never materialized. In fact, despite repeat Fed
rate cuts and a federal consumer tax rebate, the technology-driven Nasdaq
has lost another 25% of its value in the past three months, with the broader
S&P 500 index dropping 15%.

Traditionally, stock markets are a leading indicator of the economy. When
markets began hemorrhaging last summer and fall, they correctly signalled
the onset of a business slump. This has happened many times in economic
history. Going back 20 years, during the early Reagan administration,
national economic gloom was punctured by a big stock-market rally in the
second half of 1982 which correctly heralded the long prosperity boom.

But it's not happening now. Actually, applying a normal six-to-nine-month
lead time, stock markets are beginning to signal that no recovery will occur
until the second half of next year.

Investor spirits and business confidence continues to sink. A daily drum
beat of bad earnings reports has overwhelmed the stock markets. Some of the
numbers are startling: semiconductor profits are off 85%; telecommunications
are down 72%; durable-goods are makers off 77% - all for the second quarter.
Leading surveys now predict an incredible 67% additional drop in technology
profits for the third quarter, and perhaps another 40% drop in the fourth.

The real message coming from the equity market is that the economy is
getting worse, not better. Undoubtedly, some of this pessimism springs from
a rather looney-tune debate in Washington, where leading Democrats are
ranting over dwindling budget surpluses, virtually foreclosing any hope of
additional and much-needed tax-cut stimulus. Al Gore's old lockbox for
Social Security trust funds has resurfaced. And the Bush administration,
which is favorably inclined toward business tax cuts, increasingly finds
itself boxed in by Social Security scare tactics.

But there are signs of sanity in Washington. Dan L. Crippen, the head of the
Congressional Budget Office, testified that ""the attention given to what's
in the Social Security trust fund come 2015, or even if the trust fund
exists at that point, is misplaced,"" adding that ""the payroll taxes will
have no changes due to the president's tax cut."" Then, in the most sensible
statement to come out of Congress on this debate, Crippen noted, ""What will
matter is the size of the economy.""

Bravo. Crippen for president, or Fed chairman, or something. The size of the
economy and its ability to grow is the absolute keypoint that is being
ignored in this dreary, Herbert Hoover-like budget debate.

While the Bush tax cuts passed by Congress are a move in the right direction
over the long term, in the short run they are having little or no effect.
Retailers around the country are reporting virtually no evidence that the
tax rebates are boosting sales. Even more to the point, the nation is faced
with a supply-side business downturn, not a consumer demand-side decline.
It's as though the government economic doctors, having made the wrong
diagnoses, are now prescribing the wrong remedy.

On the monetary side, the Fed is finally ending its scorched-earth deflation
by cutting interest rates and expanding the money supply, which will propel
aggregate demand, not supply. Yet, the collapse of business investment,
production, and profits is a supply-side, or investment-side, problem. The
right remedy would be across-the-board tax reform to boost work effort and
capital formation through lower tax-rate incentives on individuals and
businesses.

But the tax-rate reduction in the Bush plan doesn't kick in for five years.
And with Democrats ranting over the holy budget surplus, the chance of true
business tax relief - including measures such as capital gains and
accelerated depreciation allowances - are minimal.

The Fed, the White House, and the Treasury should heed the message of the
real-world stock market. It is clearly telling us that the economy could be
much worse, and that the role of government policy should be much more
stimulative on both money and taxes. A combination of supply-side tax cuts
and greater Fed stimulus will grow the economy, protect Social Security,
increase long-term budget surpluses, and preserve America's role as world
leader.

The sooner Washington comes to its senses the faster economic recovery will
begin.

"[smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Brothers,
    My youngest son Joe, a Beta pledge at Auburn, called me last night to
inform me their chapter's charter has been revoked, effectively ending 34
years of Beta's at Auburn.  At a recent costume party, several pledges (Joe
NOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all black
fraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat's
letters.  As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reaction
in Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement,
ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.  The incident coincided with
the Delta Sig chapter doing something even more stupid at a separate party
on a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their party
photographer of three D Sigs dressed as a black, a KKK clansman and a
Confederate soldier, all looking as if they were trying to hang or shoot the
black.  Brilliant huh???  That incident really got the student body in an
uproar and then the Beta deal came to light about the same time and bam,
goodbye Betas.
    I only tell the story here because there have been many news coverages
of both events across the country, making the Betas look like they were way
out of line when, in fact, it was pretty harmless and the black fraternity
really was only tremendously upset with the D Sigs.  Joe, his pledge
brothers, and the actives are in shock at the severity of the decision by
Oxford and I must admit, so am I.  If any of you out there have any ideas on
what to do about it, I certainly would welcome them.  Joe was really falling
in love with that chapter and it had a ton of campus leaders in it, much
like Gamma Omega did once upon a time.  My feeling is that the chapter
deserved some serious and accountable disciplinary punishments and the
chapter agreed what they did was stupid and in horrible taste, but to
abolish a 34 year old, 120 man chapter for the actions of a few????? I'm
really pissed.

Yours in -kai-,

"David Doctor/Genscape, Inc.","Jeff:

This is just a quick ""head's up"" to advise you that I am no longer retired
and am CEO of an energy information start-up, Genscape, Inc., based in
Louisvllle.  Two founders (32 year olds) left power trading positions to
pursue the development of technology able to measure the electric and
magnetic fields emanating from high-voltage lines connected to power plants.
They were successful and can now translate those measurements into highly
accurate estimates of transmission line load and direction and from that
make a highly accurate estimate of a power plant's generating status.  The
information is delivered to customers via Internet on a real-time basis.
Genscape will by year end have built a monitoring network capable of
monitoring 250+ plants or startegic transmission points in the Continental
U.S.  Genscape's initial customers are energy trading companies and
subsequent customers will be power generators, transmission and distribution
operators, insurers, fuel suppliers and transporters, regulators and
wholesale power consumers.

The reason for the ""head's up"" at this time is that I'll be meeting with
Scott Tholan of your staff on Tuesday, May 1, to review Genscape's product.

"Master Limited Partnerships","Dear Sir,
	As you know Lehman Brothers is one of the most prestigious
investment banks on Wall Street.  On a regular basis Lehman brings new
companies public in many industries.  One area that has received great
interest lately is Master Limited Partnerships.  These vehicles generally
have high yields (in the 10% range) with tax advantages.  In today's
environment of low interest rates that is extremely attractive.  If you
would like to learn more the next time we offer one by prospectus please
e-mail or call.
				All the best!!

[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   The finer things in life are sometimes green. Our modestly monochromatic  Fragrant  Eucalyptus Bouquet  (shown right) is a natural display of greenery  that shows true luxury has nothing to do with imposing grandeur.  Easy to arrange in our architectural glass vase, the bouquet can  be left to air-dry naturally for enjoyment indefinitely in the  home or workplace, and has a unique fresh scent.   With its handcrafted, grass-covered pot, our Grass  and Grain Sculpture  is an unusual dried arrangement in a natural  palette of beiges and pale gray-greens. Perfectly suited for any  type of gift giving, it is an interesting way to add natural beauty  to a setting and best of all, it requires no care.  As the weather changes, you can surely add warmth to a special  occasion with our decisively different Strawflower Plant . Also known as Everlasting Flower or Paper  Daisy, our cheerful Strawflower plant will bloom for months. The  papery petals actually make a rustling sound as the flowers open!  Two eclectic fall specials we are proud to showcase this October  are our Obake Anthuriums  and our majestic Protea   that create a much-admired tropical look.

"Insight on Effectiveness: Channels Rule","
 [IMAGE] 	
    Product  is no longer king. Channels rule. by Tim Riesterer, VP Market Development, Ventaso  In  today's highly charged B2B market, it's not so much what you sell  anymore - but how you sell it. Product is no longer king. The  channels by which complex products and services are marketed and  sold have become the new drivers of economic success, influencing:  Prospect  brand decisions Market  share growth Top-line  revenue gains Bottom-line  profitability  Pressure  for continued growth in each of these areas is forcing many companies  to aggressively pursue expanded channel partnerships, marketing alliances, e-commerce initiatives,  as well as mergers and acquisitions.On paper, these proliferating channels promise great possibilities.But, in practical application, they remain pools of untapped  potential.  Thats  why industry experts predict that increasing channel member effectiveness  will be the number one strategic objective for improving top-  and bottom-line corporate performance in the coming years.  That's  why Ventaso predicts that enabling channel partners to easily  access and deliver the right marketing messages and sales support  at the right time -- will be key to increasing their effectiveness  in helping grow your business.    To  learn more about how you can improve your sales channel effectiveness  visit http://www.ventaso.com/effectiveness .

"Re: [smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush","Dear Beta Bros,

     I fully intended to respond to Woody's e-mail and forward about
President Bush much more quickly than this.  I noticed that there was no
response out there when Woody posted this and I didn't want him to
feel so lonely, so here goes... (warning: this is not lighthearted fare!)
     I'm sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since
September 11th.  That day was a vivid reminder that I don't have a choice in
determining how or when I'm going to die (barring suicide of course), but I
do have a choice about how I'm going to live.  September 11th and the events
which continue to unfold have caused me to focus a whole lot more on what's
truly important in life- family, relationships, faith.
     Believing that those terrorists were willing to die for a lie, I've
been forced to ask myself- what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe
is the TRUTH?
     For many of you guys, I confess, I failed to personally share what I
believed was the truth, even back in college.  I was not willing to
sacrifice acceptance- a hard thing for a college kid to give up. Forgive me
for that.
     [Unbelievably, just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted
by a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you
may have known. He was a football player and on my freshman floor at SMU.  I
wish I had room to tell you Gary's whole story.  In short, we were friends,
I watched him begin trashing his life in the Spring semester but failed to
try to help much.  Gary became an alcoholic, just sobering up three years
ago.  But, too late to recover from damage that had been done.  He walked
into my life again two months ago when, through a series of ""coincidences,""
he ended up at our church.  His father just called to tell me that Gary died
last night.  I can't help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided
had I done more in the Spring of '72? So, it's now with grief and an even
greater sense of urgency that I write this today.]
     If recent events have moved you to a place of searching and seeking,
please read on and allow me a few moments of your time to share what I've
experienced as real truth about real life.
     I've found the evidence to be very compelling that this planet and all
it contains (including us), is the design of a very imaginative Creator.
That Creator is not an impersonal force, or removed and simply ""watching us
from a distance."" He is a personal being who knows His creation and
desperately desires to be known by them.  He so much desires to be known by
us that, in a manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to
face, He became a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
     Some think perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet.
However, I realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not
accept that.  Jesus claimed to be God; and he claimed to hold the key to
people's eternal destiny.  Jesus'claims left only three options.  He was
either a liar (the worst kind because he deceived people about their
eternity), a lunatic, or, he was who he said he was- he was Lord.
     Could God love me that much, to go that far?  To allow His own Son to
come and show us and teach us what God is like? To die on a cross to pay the
penalty of my sin and obtain my forgiveness? To rise from the dead to secure
the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God both now and
forever?
     Personally, I've found all of the above to be true.  God is a personal
God.  Jesus is Lord.  And, God does love me that much- to suffer the death
of His own Son in order to offer real life (now and forever) to me and
anyone else who is willing to do just one thing...  receive that gift; just
accept Him.
     A number of years ago I did accept Him.  And, in doing that, I've
experienced everything He said to be true.  Life has not been problem-free.
That's not what He promised, in fact, Jesus assured us that we will have
problems in this life.  But, He has always personally been there. He has
always given His strength, wisdom, guidance, peace, contentment, patience,
encouragement, hope, and love. [These Scriptures tell about it: John 3:16,
Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 13, and many more]
     As Woody's e-mail stated, it is encouraging to know where this
President is turning at such a time as this.  Thank God that's a personal
relationship that's offered to anyone who seeks it, not just the big boys.
Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these thoughts.
      If you'd like to talk more about this, I'd love to do so.  My phone
number is 918-743-8897 (office), 918-298-6144 (home) and my e-mail addresses
are pastorhess@hotmail.com,or, hess@shbc-tulsa.org.  I wish I could be at
more of the gatherings, but weekends are a tough time to get away in this
business!  May God bless you all.

-kai-

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

VOTENET ACQUIRES eCONTRIBUTOR
Firm Emerges as Online Fundraising Market Leader

WASHINGTON, D.C. (September 7, 2001) - In a move expected to dramatically alter the scope and significance of online fundraising, Votenet Solutions, Inc. (<http://www.votenet.com>) today announced the successful completion of its acquisition of eContributor (<http://www.eContributor.com>).  Also headquartered in Washington, DC, eContributor became the industry leader last year by providing Internet fundraising software to a wide range of clients that includes trade associations, PACs, non-profits including faith-based organizations, educational institutions, presidential campaigns, national and state political parties, as well as numerous congressional campaigns.  Over $10 million in online contributions have flowed to almost 500 customers using the market leading eContributor online fundraising software.  Votenet Solutions is a non-partisan, non-ideological technology solutions firm that provides a suite of products and services for political, public policy and non-profit o!
rganizations.

Speculation regarding the acquisition of eContributor by Votenet had been building for several months prior to today's formal announcement of the completion of the acquisition.  ""Votenet is pleased to welcome eContributor's almost 500 customers to its growing customer base that is now approaching 2,000 organizations.  eContributor built its reputation based on providing stellar customer service and Votenet promises to emulate and even improve on this high standard,"" stated Mitchell Reisberg, Votenet's Vice President of Sales.

Glen Hughlette, Votenet's CEO observed ""Billions of dollars are contributed to non-profit, charitable and political organizations annually.  Each year a larger percentage of these contributions are moved online.  I am pleased and thankful that Votenet had the financial wherewithal to successfully accomplish this asset acquisition and overnight secure the market leadership position in such a strategically important and fast growing market.  The eContributor software perfectly complements many of our other related solutions but especially our web site hosting and marketing package.""

Trey Richardson, eContributor.com's CEO stated, ""eContributor is much more than just the market leading online fundraising software solution.  It is the most efficient way for organizations to raise the funds they need to accomplish their goals and objectives.  And the organziations' mission statements can be as different and diverse as raising funds to conduct medical research, build a new clinic, influence the direction and outcome of legislation and regulations, or win an election for public office.  Funds can be raised for less than 10 cents on the dollar using eContributor online fundraising software.  A dramatic difference when compared to the 70 cents on the dollar cost of using phone solicitation, and 50 cents on the dollar cost of using direct mail.""

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

"Welcome to Turkey","Hi Sue and Mark!
     We followed your flight until it was 4 hours from Istanbul on the
computer.  It was about 11 PM when I finally stopped. I checked the flight
four times.   the first time you were 877miles ENE of Portland, Maine doing
460 knots at 29,00o feet.  You were a little late leaving Kennedy as takeoff
was 6:11PM NY time.  I wasn't up for Istanbul arrival but figured you should
be close to schedule on landing.  Hope the flight was a smooth one and I hope
you got some sleep.
      Say hello to Sukran for us and tell her we love her.
      Mother and I are saying prayers for all of you and Our thoughts will be
with you all weekend.
       LOTS of LOVE and KISSES   MOTHER and DAD
      PS to SUE:  Thank you for making the trip.

"New Forum","It was determined by a vote of the Forum Moderators at
our meeting May 8th to form a new Forum (Forum VIII).
This decision was based on the current Forum
membership (81); the number of new members wishing to
participate; and the number of prospective members
currently in process.

The new Forum affords a unique opportunity for
existing members.  In an effort to blend the
experience of new members with seasoned Forum members,
we are looking for the following:
     a)	A member who wishes to change Forums
     b)	Current Forum member having 3 years or less
     eligibility remaining in YPO who would like to
     help mentor an additional Forum.

We are considering that this may give a member the
opportunity to interact with other Houston YPOers or
perhaps re-invigorate an individual's Forum
experience.

If you have any interest, please contact me by May
22nd.  Please know that all questions, thoughts, or
expressions of interest will be held by me in strict
confidence.

By way of process, the new Forum will participate in
the draw with the other Forums who have indicated they
need members.  They will select first in the order.

We trust that this process will give the new Forum an
immediate opportunity to be successful.

Thank you for your cooperation.

IBM Global Insurance Executive Conference
Hotel Inter-Continental, Berlin, Germany
October 3-5, 2001

- This event is IBM Global Insurance Industry's premier customer event, and
provides
a forum for exploring new growth and e-business opportunities in the
changing
financial services world. It is a spouse event with a planned social and
partner program.

- You are requested to speak for 45 minutes including a short question and
answer period
on October 4 (or October 3 if it is more convenient). We'd like you to talk
about the
Enron growth story, discussing how Enron has changed the face of the energy
industry.
We think the executives will be interested to learn how innovation and
investment coupled
with an entrepreneurial strategy has worked to make Enron one of the most
highly respected
companies in the world. In addition, we'd like you to discuss Enron's role
in financial services
as you create and participate in e-markets for a variety of goods and
services. Since insurance
companies are increasingly playing in energy risk management, in weather
risk management
and other areas, these insurance and financial services executives ought to
have significant
interest in your addressing Enron's leadership in this area as well.

- Anticipated audience is 100-125 CEOs and senior business executives from
major insurance
and financial services companies around the globe, plus accompanying IBM
hosts.
There should be ample opportunity to network.

- If you would like, we will provide professionals to assist you with your
content and presentation.

- You and your spouse are guests of IBM.

- This event receives media coverage from many European dailies and
periodicals, including
Financial Times, Handelsblatt, Les Echos and usually especially strong
coverage from the Nordics,
so we can facilitate an Enron story, if you'd like.

- On a personal note, Berlin is an amazing city (4X the size of Paris) with
a wealth of history
spanning 800 years. Our partner program is designed with exclusive tours.
The gala dinner
Thursday evening will be spectacular.

- Attached is a brochure, and I can provide a hardcopy version, from our
conference last year
in Barcelona. We plan to do something similar this year. It was an insert
in the American Banker
and insurance trade magazines.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"FINISH IN STYLE","Help us with inaugurate our first-time finish tent in Austin (as big as regulations allow due to the space available).   It is there that you will get your finish prize which will add some real value to the pain and suffering of your two-day trek in addition to making you the envy of your neighborhood.   

Amy Moore, our Austin volunteer lead, will have been there since Saturday to make sure you get your fill of beer, soft drinks and junk food, which is just what most of us want at that point.

If you're hungrier than that, Hooter's is serving dinner to everyone with a wrist-band.

Reminder:  If you're riding the bus back to Houston, drop your bike first, and then celebrate.  Average time for bike transport to Houston after the drop is 5 hours, and it would be good to get the bike there before you.

THANKS FOR RIDING WITH ENRON !!

"Re: [smu-betas] -kai-","
ELVIS :
 
FINE !..........I always liked you  better when I thought you were from Summit, NJ. The reason for the question,  d---head, was since I didn't get a response from Mr. Haulenbeek I thought ,  perhaps, I wasn't reaching him, especially since there had been some talk about  some Betas no longer being on the list, etc, so there. And please say  HELLO to the very lovely Margaret.

C-PAUL and Artie :   Thanks for  responding in a very civil and cordial manner. It shows you are at least  educated and have developed manners!   By the way Chuck, what ever  happened to those people we played spades with : El Sheldon, Barry etc

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

"MIRACLE IN BELLVILLE","As most of you know, one of our beloved team members had a serious accident during the MS150 on Saturday, just before the Bellville lunch stop.  His name is Joseph Kaye, and he is a two-year veteran of Team Enron.  He was taken by helicopter to a trauma unit in the medical center where he remains in ICCU.  I want you to know that even though his prognosis was bleak at one time, he has come out of his coma, has demonstrated control of all his extremities, and we are anticipating a full recovery.  He has several fractures of his skull which will heal, and he has no spinal impairment.  This healing is a miracle unfolding.

I have just returned from a visit with Joseph's family.  I told them you have been e-mailing and calling, and they asked me to thank you for all the concern you have expressed and the prayers that have been sent his way.  The family asked that I receive any cards or letters you may wish to send, and I will make sure they are delivered as appropriate. 

Please send to: 
 Amelia Alder, Enron Corp, P.O. Box 1188, Suite 3AC-3120, Houston, TX 77251-1188.

We have been unable to determine the cause of the accident, and only know that it did not involve a collision with a motor vehicle or another bike.  

And you might know......those of you who share his passion of cycling......some of the first thoughts he was able to communicate by writing with his good hand were:  ""Where's my bike?""

Please keep Joseph in your thoughts and prayers, and I will keep you posted if there is any other news.

Best regards,

Amelia

Jeff,

We last spoke a month or so ago...just after you returned home from your
trip with your son, yet prior to your annoncement to leave Enron. You were
kind enough to return my call based on our YPO connection.

Since we last spoke, I have started a new company, APB Merchant Services,
within a very successful energy brokering company called APB Energy.

I would like to talk with you, or someone within Enron...perhaps Jeff
Donahue, about assistance in asset disposal. We represent a large base of
cash buyers and have successfully made markets in this Telecom space.

Either way, I would enjoy an opportunitty to catch up with you...please call
502.212.4908.

"Outlook Communication","Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our email environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that we have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues. 
?	During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exchange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug, which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the better part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which appears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchange servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?	Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experienced database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Outlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchange servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected server.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use -- we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems with the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the business week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to move users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impacted users could not access their e-mail.
?	During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and dangerous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against viruses that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktops.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day.  The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but we believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron computing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this time, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as the performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the last few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

"Inknowvator Inc. & Revolutionaries Ball","Jeff,  I am a cofounder of Inknowvator Inc.  I live in Houston, actually
Gene Humphrey is my next door neighbor.

Our new Idea Manager solution was recently selected by  Xcelerator to
identify, develop and select new ventures.  This was put on hold following
the recent management change.  Oddly enough, the Knowledge Management
group, then housed in EES, also thought  we were the ""best thing since
sliced bread"" and wanted to bring us in as an Enron corporate offering.  As
you know, that group was disbanded.

I was interested in your participation in the Revolutionaries Ball.   We
are in discussions with Gary Hamel's company, Strategos.  It turned out
that we have very similar clients and our software solution can be a
natural enabler for Strategos's approach to innovation (Halliburton is our
latest corporate innovation client).  Also, we can  target our solution at
venture management (Xcelerator), M&A (Chevron-Texaco) and new service
development (Schlumberger).

I believe that we are an ideal solution for Enron to identify and develop
new business ventures, to enhance current products and services,  and to
share ideas and learnings across the company.  I would like to meet with
you to discuss our solution


I look forward to hearing from you.

"Enron Candidate","Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Drow could drop trow over the burning roof and let go with a flutter blast or 
a three point freep and put out the blaze. Lord Windasmere to the rescue!  Oh 
he shits!  The champion is disqualified! 
See you in Norman on the 24th.  Tell Joe Don Looney to be there, in drag or 
normal clothes.  OU Sooners...13 in a row and only 35 more to go to break the 
record and give Dent a reason to write another book!

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a ""last veto"" right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Subject:	My Resignation, and a Question

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Jay

"Paycheck Fiasco","I want to document my appreciation for your efforts and attitude during this incident.  You showed compassion and moved quickly to resolve the issue.  There was no hesitation on April's part to make loans to Jenny and me.  Compensatory efforts have resulted in April taking Jenny and me to lunch, Amy initiating and funding another lunch for us and Dave Parquet mandating us four hours pay for waiting at home on a Saturday to recieve replacement checks via Fedex that turned out to be non-negotiable.

I have cc'd Jeff Skilling because I believe he needs to know that he has very efficient and compassionate people working for Enron.  April, Amy and Cristina, thank you for being yourselves.

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

With click-through rates plunging all over the World Wide Web, conventional wisdom says that Internet portals no longer have a legitimate place in consumer marketing plans.

An exclusive analysis by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, however, paints an entirely different picture.  True...the role of portals has changed, but the change has made them even more potent than before.  Instead of mere gateways, portals are centers of content and commerce that draw audiences in the same way that large-circulation magazines and successful TV networks do.

Major changes are taking place in terms of banner advertising, search engine use, per-click pricing, and the way business is done on the Internet.  But the truly amazing aspect of all this is that portals are still changing.  First they were gateways, now they are destinations...what will the next phase be?  And what will it mean to you?

To find the answers to those questions, I suggest that you carefully read ""The Great Portal Payoff"" by Horacio D. Rozanski and Gerry Bollman in the upcoming issue of strategy+business.

When you do, you will see why strategy+business is so eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we are on the subject, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...but it would be best if you make arrangements right now to extend your subscription.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Linda Grumbles just informed me that John is not recovering the way the
Drs. want him to and that the same artery may be blocked again, or even
closed.  In other words, the first catheter treatment didn't pan out.  He
goes back in for another one, this time probably installing a stint in the
artery to keep it open, next week on Sept. 14.  His email address has
changed and it's now jgrumbles76@hotmail.com.  I'm certain he and Linda
would appreciate your keeping them in your prayers.

Yours in -kai-,

"The Morning Market Call - Monday September 24th, 2001.","
			Good Monday Morning!

Abbreviated Edition.


IMPACT CALLS

Internet Security Israel Hernandez
Company Updates/Rating Changes
q Investment Conclusion: Below are specific company updates and our views on
each company in
our coverage universe. Reiterating our thoughts published on September 17,
we believe last
week's attacks are likely to cause numerous short-term disruptions that put
the September quarter
at risk for all the security software vendors, particularly those vulnerable
to discretionary spending
cuts or large deals. In light of recent events, we are adjusting our ratings
on two companies. We
are raising our rating on VeriSign from a 2-Buy to 1-Strong Buy based on
good earnings visibility
amid a generally uncertain outlook for most software vendors. We are also
lowering our rating on
Internet Security Systems from a 1-Strong Buy to 2-Buy to adjust for these
uncertainties and lack
of visibility. While valuations for many of the companies are starting to
look interesting, as a
whole, we remain somewhat cautious on the security software vendors given
the uncertainties
introduced into the market over the last two weeks which could lead to more
downward revisions
in the September and December quarters and spill over in the first quarter
of 2002.

Internet Secuirty Systems Israel Hernandez
Downgrading from Strong Buy to Buy 2 - Buy / $13.00 (USD)
q We are downgrading ISSX from a 1- Strong Buy to a 2-Buy rating to reflect
the lack of near-term
visibility, and changing economic backdrop that increases the likelihood of
a potential shortfall to
our Q3 forecast.
q Given the events of the past two weeks, we believe ISS and other security
software vendors may run into
difficulty closing business in a back-end loaded September quarter.
q We are lowering our price target from $35 to $20, or 4 x FY01 revenues of
$223M, to reflect the increased
economic uncertainty in the current environment.

VeriSign Inc Israel Hernandez
Upgrading to Strong Buy from Buy 1 - Strong Buy / $38.30 (USD)
q Given VeriSign's strong revenue visibility in a period of global economic
uncertainty, we are
raising our rating from 2-Buy to 1-Strong Buy making it our top pick in the
sector.
q In light of the global slowdown, we believe VeriSign provides investors
with exceptional earnings visibility
given its services model and strong deferred revenue balance. This
visibility should enable VeriSign to
sustain a premium valuation and outperform most technology stocks, even in a
contracting environment.
q We believe new value added services laid on top of a relatively fixed cost
structure will provide significant
margin expansion, currently at 14.6% and growing to the low thirties in the
next 2 years.

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production Thomas R. Driscoll
Some E&P Shares Now Appear Attractive
q We are lowering our natural gas price forecasts as well as revising target
prices and codes for the
large-cap oil exploration and production companies we cover. We now believe
that several
companies we cover offer compelling values today. As a result we are
upgrading our ratings on the
shares of EOG Resources (EOG), Noble Affiliates (NBL) and Pioneer Natural
Resources (PXD) from
2-Buy to 1-Strong Buy. We are also downgrading our code on the shares of
Devon Energy (DVN)
from 2-Buy to 3-Outperfrom to reflect heightened concerns about the
increased debt load that will
result from recently announced acquisitions. We are also downgrading our
codes on Vintage
Petroleum (VPI) from 1-Strong Buy to 2-Buy.

AOL Time Warner Holly Becker
Fund. Remain Strong In Unstable Environm 2 - Buy / $29.25 (USD)
q The economic and advertising slowdown has obviously been compounded by
recent tragic events.
AOL Time Warner remains the premier integrated media company with a uniquely
valuable
portfolio of assets. While near-term estimates may need to come down
further, we view the stock's
pullback as a compelling buying opportunity.
q AOL Time Warner's core businesses offer investors superior earnings power
and growth, while new cross-platform
initiatives should propel the company's long-term growth rate to above
industry norms.
q Advertising represents only 25% of revenue, considerably lower than
comparable companies including
Viacom (45%) and Disney (30%).

Gaming & Lodging Joyce Minor
Rich Bottom Fishing, But Dangerous Water
q The gaming and lodging sectors saw huge downside moves last week, with the
large cap gaming
stocks down an average of -33% and the lodging stocks down an average of
-34%. The hotel
REITs were down too, by -39% on average. We continue to believe that calling
the course of the
conflict determines your appetite for the sector. Investors that believe in
a short period of pain
followed by a gradual rebound would buy the stocks now, especially gaming
companies like HET,
STN, PENN, but even the other large cap gaming and lodging names would
appear near historical
bottoms and attractive for the long haul. Among the hotel REITs, the
unwinding of the FCH/MHX
merger seems to have overly punished both, but especially MHX. We think MHX
is an absolute 1-
Strong Buy at these levels. More broadly, investors like us that are
concerned by the potential
course and duration of the conflict and the risk of events that will merit
continuing travel fears may
opt to stay on the sidelines with respect to the gaming and lodging stocks.
q Lodging stocks are trading at discounts to replacement of 15% to 45% (vs.
typical 30% bottom) and
gaming at discounts of 20% or so. Lodging REIT yields are 9% to 14%, even if
dividends are reduced by
40%.

Wireless & Internet Infrastructure Timothy Luke
Investigating Chinese Telecom Markets
q Following checks with numerous industry sources in China, we have
attempted to clarify some
concerns over China Telecom's capex & a possible slowdown in metro markets
in China.
q Believe CT may have reduced its planned '01 capex in recent months by
about 25% from $12b to $9b and
slowed down discretionary spending. Reductions appear to be a result from
the uncertainty pending CT's
major reorganization.
q In the n-term, we believe that vendors like Cisco and Nortel may see their
sales into CT somewhat below
normalized levels. However, this situation should be temporary and we may
see an uptick in spending by
CT once reorg is completed. Nevertheless, we believe '02 capex is likely to
be below '01.
q Separately, the Chinese Ministry of Information Industry recently issued a
Notice to regulate broadband
access networks. We believe some metro vendors may be impacted by this
ruling since Layer 3 switches
are also sometimes deployed to provide last-mile access.

FOCUS STOCK

Bed Bath & Beyond Alan Rifkin
Second Quarter Earnings Preview 2 - Buy / $20.61 (USD)
q BBBY will report 2Q EPS after the market close on September 25. While no
retailer is immune to an
economic slowdown, we remain confident BBBY will achieve our 2Q EPS est of
$0.18 vs $0.15 last
year.
q We estimate total sales rose 24% to $730.8MM, driven by a 3% comp.
q We forecast a 9 bp decrease in gross margin, which combined with an 11 bp
improvement in SG&A,
results in a modest increase in 2Q operating margin.
q BBBY remains one of our top picks---the only retailer within our universe
of coverage to meet or exceed its
original guidance since mid-2000. Well-insulated with $276MM in cash and $0
debt.
q Valuation. Currently trading at a 39% premium to S&P 500, though
historically has traded b/w a 20%
discount and 115% premium.


Liberty Media Group Stuart Linde
Sensitivity Analysis: Limited Downside 1 - Strong Buy / $11.93 (USD)
q Our worst case scenario yields a NAV of $13.32 per share. We believe that
current trading levels
represent a compelling buying opportunity as downside risk is limited by (1)
lowest exposure to
advertising market in our universe, (2) risk management strategy and (3)
strong balance sheet.
q At the close of 09/21, 10 days following the tragic terrorist attacks,
LMCA has declined by 16%, in line with
the S&P Entertainment Index versus a 14% decline for the market.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE

Health Care Distribution & Technology Lawrence Marsh
Lehman Weekly Persp. - ""THE WORST DAY""
q Lehman Brothers Health Care Distribution & Technology Weekly Comments and
Perspectives
q We are providing a review of last week in our Health Care Distribution &
Technology universe - ""THE
WORST DAY"", commenting on the horror seen in the city on September 11.
q Our covered group was down 7.8% since September 7th vs. the S&P 500 down
11.3%, the Russell 2000
down 15.5%, and the NASDAQ Composite down 16.1% over the same period. Henry
Schein, up 3.4%,
was the strongest performer for that period; OMI, down 15.4%, was the
weakest performer.
q We are providing a brief review of implications from the past two weeks in
our group, and also pointing to
points from our 2001 Fall Outlook Update. We also point to our reiteration
of our initiations on ACDO and
GTIV, and our upgrade on PSSI.
q We are providing a 10-K review of DKWD, highlighting a SCOR update, and
noting recent news items,
from CAH, GTIV, SCOR, PSSI, OMI.

Portfolio Strategy 	Charles Reinhard
Cutting Exp. EPS, Eqty Returns, & Valuat
q The policy response to the savage attack on civilization continues to be
vigorous. A sustained
diplomatic and military campaign against terrorism is coming into place.
Monetary policy has been
aggressive, with more to come. And fiscal policy is swinging into gear.
Still, the United States is
likely to remain in recession for the remainder of 2001. We are thus cutting
our 2001-2002 S&P 500
EPS forecast from $49.25 to $46.50 this year, and from $59.00 to $53.00 next
year. In a riskier world,
we are also assuming lower valuation for the stock market. Accordingly, we
are cutting our forward
one-year S&P 500 price target from 1375 to 1200; the Dow Jones Industrials
equivalent is 10,000.
q Our Economics team is now looking for a shallow U.S. recession for the
second half of this year, with GDP
down roughly 1.5% in the third and fourth quarters. The jobless rate will
rise to 5.3%, we think, as CPI
drops to 1.9%. With the Fed Funds rate at 3%, expect the Federal Reserve to
cut rates to 2.5% at the next
FOMC on October 2. With core CPI at 2.7%, that would take the real Fed Funds
rate below zero.
Historically, the real Fed Funds rate has always gone to at least zero
during profit recessions of the current
magnitude. Whether the Fed will need to do more after October 2 remains to
be seen. That the central
bank will do whatever it needs to do is beyond question. With another drop
in short-term interest rates, the
yield curve should steepen further.

NOTES FROM TODAY
Specialty Chemicals Timothy Gerdeman
Cautiously Accumulate Select Chem Stks
q While it remains premature to fully assess the ultimate impact to U.S.
specialty chemical
companies resulting from last week's terrorist attacks, certain stock
valuations may already
discount the likely adverse business impact. The table provided below lists
respective share price
declines occurring since the stock market reopened on September 17. For
conservatism, we now
assume zero global GDP growth and flat (versus prior expectation of lower)
2002 raw material
costs, which could place an approximately 10% downward bias to our average
2002 EPS
expectations. Handicapping our preferred share-price entry points for risks
currently present, right
now we would accumulate CYT particularly below $25/ share, CBM particularly
below $38/ share,
EC particularly below $23/ share, and APD below $38/ share.

Carnival Corp Felicia Rae Kantor
Searching for a Bottom 3 - Market Perform / $17.13 (USD)
q We are maintaining our Market Perform rating on CCL. While the company had
impressive
momentum going into 4Q01 and 2002, the macro-environment has changed. As
such, the
risk/reward still points to the downside, in our opinion.
q That said, this note provides investors with several tools that should
provide assistance with finding an
attractive entry point for CCL.
q We have also taken a first stab at our earnings estimates by lowering
4Q01E and 2002E EPS to $0.20 and
$1.50 from $0.30 and $1.85, respectively.
q Both our scenario revenue analysis and our total return analysis
illustrates that the stock could bottom at
$14-$15. However, a protracted and deep recession could render this analysis
invalid.

Darden Restaurants Mitchell Speiser
Conf Call Hi-Lights; Sept Solid 1 - Strong Buy / $24.79 (USD)
q Comps steadily improved following last Tues & are now running Positive.
Fears of vulnerability
seem overestimated, even in a weaker economy.
q Mgmt maintains FY02 Comps target at lower-end of 3-5% range & 15-20% EPS
growth; forecast takes into
account the ill-effects of rising unemployment.
q Sales trends resumed to normal levels over the weekend & are running
positive, much better than
expectations. Through last Sunday, Olive Garden Comps +3-4%, Red Lobster
+2-3%.
q An aging consumer, lower seafood costs, less dilution from new concepts &
Repo will occur despite
weaker economy so our FY02E EPS remains >15%.

Department Stores/Broadlines Jeffrey Feiner
Retail Company Share Repurchase Programs
q Below we have listed the buyback authorizations as well as the share
repurchase activities for the
major retailers.
q We believe certain of the major retailers including Wal-Mart and May
Department Stores have been
aggressively buying shares this past week with the drop in the equities
markets. As many of the major
retailers in our universe have significant cash balances and ample
availability left under current share
authorizations, we would expect many retailers to continue to repurchase
company shares at these
depressed levels which could cushion some downside from poor September sales
results. Note that
shares left under authorization may differ from levels reported below due to
the market activities of
companies since the end of their respective 2Q01 reporting periods.

Department Stores/Broadlines Jeffrey Feiner
Retail Industry Update Conference Call
q We cordially invite you to participate in our conference call to update
investors on Department
Store/Broadline Retailers on Monday, September 24, 2001, at 2:30 p.m. (EST).
q With the continued uncertainty around consumer confidence and retail
spending, we believe that several
retailers offer a reasonable amount of downside protection given their
defensive positioning relative to
product mix. We will be providing investors with an update on several select
stocks including Wal-Mart,
Costco, Kmart, BJ's, and Family Dollar as well as providing investors with
an update on the overall
department store/Broadline and Specialty Stores apparel retail industry.

Oil Tankers Daniel L. Barcelo
Weaker Demand Outweighs any War Bounce
q Tragedy buttressing rates near-term; Negative implications next year
q Due to the terrorist attacks, economic activity and air travel are
expected to be lower, resulting in lower
demand for oil products this year and next. However, it is not likely that
supply will be immediately
interrupted, as major oil producing nations are not yet direct targets for
retaliation. As charterhire rates
track oil production we expect sustained upward movement in rates near-term.
If a supply interruption does
occur it will be negative for charterhire rates. Lower economic growth next
year could imply less supply
from OPEC. Valuations remain extremely depressed with shares trading at a
discount to NAV and 3.5x
EV/DACF with a 2002 group average ROCE of over 15%, however, the low
liquidity of the group is a
negative in this market.


Duke Energy Daniel Ford
Duke Energy Acquires Westcoast Energy 2 - Buy / $37.17 (USD)
q ? In our opinion, the acquisition of Westcoast Energy is long-term
positive for Duke. We estimate
that the transaction will be $0.04 accretive to 2002 earnings and provide
additional growth
opportunities in North America. Near-term arbitrage pressure and regulatory
review will likely hold
back DUK shares.
q After last Thursday night's close, Duke Energy announced the acquisition
of Westcoast Energy in a stock
and cash deal valued at $8.5 billion.
q Under the terms of the agreement, Westcoast shareholders will receive
C$43.80 per share in cash, shares
of Duke Energy or a combination of both such that the overall consideration
will be 50% cash and 50%
stock.

PG&E Corp Daniel Ford
PCG Reorganization Plan Emerges 2 - Buy / $15.72 (USD)
q PCG's utility filed a bankruptcy reorganization plan in SF yesterday,
indicating substantial EPS
upside potential in 2003. We reiterate our 2-Buy rating. Lehman Brothers
acted as financial advisor
to PG&E Corp., which is a co-proponent of the reorg plan.
q PCG's utility subsidiary filed its plan of reorganization with the
bankruptcy court yesterday. Preliminary
analysis of the unique plan, which would not require CPUC approval,
indicates potential upside to $3.00-
3.10 of consolidated earnings in 2003 and $3.50+ in 2004.
q ? Legal challenges to specific portions of the reorganization plan could
limit the earnings upside potential
and delay the timing of emergence from bankruptcy.

Associated Banc-Corp Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview 3 - Market Perform / $30.46 (USD)
q We believe ASBC's current valuation reflects recent improvements, the
expected margin expansion
from its liability sensitive balance sheet and pristine credit quality. We
rate ASBC 3-Market
Perform.
q We expect ASBC to report 3Q01 EPS of at least $0.66 on October 18.
Continued strength in the net
interest margin could provide upside to our estimate.
q 3Q01 should witness continued expansion in net interest margin and
moderating commercial loan growth.
Mortgage banking and service fees should continue to lead increases in fee
income.
q Asset quality metrics should continue to be better than its peers.
q Our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates (old GAAP) are $2.65 and $2.85,
respectively. On a new GAAP basis
our 2002 estimate is closer to $2.95.

BB&T Corp Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: The Last Restatement 2 - Buy / $34.05 (USD)
q We rate BBT 2-Buy with a $40 price target. BBT is currently trading at a
multiple discount to the
group, compared to its typical modest premium.
q We expect BBT to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.62 ($0.66 cash) on October 11. We
believe 3Q01 results will
evidence a much better behaved NIM, decent (but slowing) loan growth, strong
fee income expansion led
by mortgage banking and controlled expenses.
q Asset quality ratios are expected to continue to show signs of
deterioration.
q While 3Q01 will mark the eighth time in the last nine quarters and the
thirteenth time in the last nineteen
quarters the company has restated results, it is expected to be the last!

First Midwest Bancorp Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Margin Expansion Continues 3 - Market Perform / $30.83 (USD)
q In our view, FMBI's strong franchise, being nicely positioned in Chicago
Land, consistent earnings
growth and sound asset quality are the reasons the company trades at a
premium to our Mid-Cap
Bank index. We rate FMBI 3-Market Perform.
q FMBI raised 3Q01 guidance today to $0.53, above its previous expectations
of $0.51 to $0.52. Better than
expected results should be driven by 20 to 25 bp expansion in the net
interest margin. Mgmt also
expressed comfort with 4Q01 consensus of $0.53. We remain a penny ahead at
$0.54.
q In addition to margin expansion, results should evidence moderate loan
growth and continued fee income
expansion.

Johnson & Johnson David A. Gruber
Coated stent leadership still evident 2 - Buy / $52.07 (USD)
q The Cook ASPECT data do not alter our hypothesis that J&J is well
positioned to obtain a
sustainable stent market share in the U.S. > 50%. The RAVEL data establish a
high standard. J&J is
believed to have at least a 9-12 month lead in the all-important U.S. stent
market. JNJ's valuation
relative to the market reflects its profile as a ""safe haven"" in these
uncertain times.
q Cook ASPECT trial results not directly comparable to J&J RAVEL data. Cook
lesions not as complex. Late
loss evident. RAVEL restenosis rate of 0% a difficult standard for
comparison.
q 2003 EPS estimates ($2.53) unchanged despite Cook results. J&J remains
highly defensive with improving
growth prospects.

Medtronic Inc David A. Gruber
Reiterating 1-Strong Buy Recommendation 1 - Strong Buy / $39.80 (USD)
q ? We are reiterating our 1-Strong Buy on Medtronic. Tuesday's analyst
meeting is likely to serve as
a catalyst for appreciation; at worst, increase investor confidence in
target attainment. Since
September 11, despite being in the defensive healthcare sector, MDT has
declined 10%, in-line with
the S&P500. Positive news flow in CHF, BMP and elsewhere is expected by
year-end.
q Early FDA approval of InSync for CHF likely to accelerate market
development by 6-12 months
q Vascular risk remains manageable. FY02 EPS guidance likely to be
unchanged. Offsetting opportunities
(led by CHF) readily identifiable.
q Analyst mtg. on Tue. to highlight 10-year CAGR of 38% and tech. platform
opportunities for sustainable
growth.

Major Pharmaceuticals Charles Butler
Peek at the Week ~ Week Ending September
q Lehman Equity Research reviews issues affecting pharmaceuticals for the
Week ending September
21st, 2001, and previews the forthcoming week.
q Bristol-Myers Squibb and Imclone Systems announced they would engage in a
JV for the cancer fighting
compound, C225. Additionally, Bristol-Myers Squibb will purchase a 19.9%
interest in Imclone with total
transactions costs at $2.0 billion.
q Eli Lilly sold worldwide rights to oritavancin, a late-stage Phase III
compound for complicated skin
infections and bacteremia. The strategic move by Lilly will allow them to
allocate their internal resources to
other late-stage pipeline opportunities.
q The FDA panel for Eli Lilly's Xigris, originally scheduled to meet
September 12th, did not convene due to
the tragedies in New York and Washington. After reviewing the Lilly
presentation & FDA's interpretation
(available on the FDA website) and speaking with two members of the Xigris
team, we increased our peak
sales estimates to $2.6 bil from $2.0 bil.
q We increased estimates for Merck KgaA from Eur 4 to Eur 4.5 and increased
long-term growth rate from
11% to 13% in light of the new deal between Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Imclone's Systems for C225.

Boeing Co Joseph F. Campbell
Thinking Through Uncertainty 2 - Buy / $30.10 (USD)
q Boeing's $29 billion total enterprise value is too cheap given the
company's $51 billion 2002
revenue, but BA is always undervalued during downturns. The current $30
price is about the
resting point until there is more info and progress towards normalcy.
q The 1st step of helping airlines weather the financial storm created by
the attacks has already been taken
by the government.
q The 2nd step of reacting is underway with the airlines and Boeing cutting
schedules and production about
20%. These dramatic rearrangements are expensive one-time financial events.

General Electric Robert Cornell
Our Takeaways From GE's Analysts Meeting 1 - Strong Buy / $31.30 (USD)
q GE endorsed 2001 EPS guidance of $1.41, which is better that many
anticipated. The bottom line is
that GE continues to deliver a double-digit growth even in the face of
significant economic
downturn. Investors should expect a continuation of double-digit growth into
2002. We are
estimating 2002 EPS at $1.60.
q Surprisingly, the short-cycle order rates have quickly bounced back to
pre-crisis levels, which coupled with
stringent cost control mechanisms, provides short-cycle businesses with a
cushion against worsening
market conditions.
q The outlook for long-cycle businesses remains very positive. The impact of
reduced air travel on Aircraft
Engines business appears to be moderate.

Broadcasting/Radio & TV William Meyers
Radio Stocks Remain Fully-Valued
q Prospects for an advertising growth recovery were in doubt prior to Sept
11 and the repercussions
(economic/social) from the incidents exacerbate an advertising environment
that was already the
weakest in the last 40 years. We now expect 2001 radio advertising to fall
8% vs. our previous
projection for a 3% decline. Concurrent with revised advertising growth
forecasts, radio equities
have fallen 16% (since September 10), larger than the 12% decline in the
S&P500 and in-line with
the NASDAQ. Despite this correction, radio equities remain fully-valued
trading at ~15x 2002E
EBITDA, only a slight discount to the 15.6x prior to the tragedies.
q While we believe the industry impact is cyclical rather than structural,
over the near-term we remain most
cautious of Cox Radio given its high valuation, Radio One based on its
leverage and Emmis given a
combination of its television exposure and high leverage.
q Conversely, we believe Clear Channel is the most defensive given its
relatively low multiple, debt leverage
and limited downside. In addition, we view Spanish Broadcasting as a special
situation (small cap) based
on its likelihood to still meet FY 4Q (Sept) estimates, continued ratings
and operating traction in its key
markets and underlying asset value.
q While radio operators have yet to quantify the near-term financial impact,
we expect a preliminary look
Wednesday when Emmis reports FY2Q (August) results.

"HERE'S THE VERY BEST","There's something about cycling that brings out the best.....and here's a couple of great examples of the very best.....Ansel Michaels and his valiant, successful attempt to do the distance, and Charles Delacey's desire to help make that journey less painful for Ansel.  I hope you find it in your hearts to salute the efforts of each of them by offering your support.  

Charles is a member of Team Enron and was the first rider in to LaGrange this year, arriving 11:15 am.  Please read the following, and if you have questions, his e-mail is Charles.Delacey@enron.com, telephone: 713-853-5757.  THANK YOU!

Subject:	Ansel Michaels/MS150

Ansel Michaels is a 15-year-old freshman at Lamar High School.  Ansel swims on the Lamar swim team and this year, for the first time, joined his swimming teammates on the 2001 MS 150.  Ansel is a paraplegic and rides a hand crank bike in which he is seated and pedals with his arms.  On the first day into LaGrange, Ansel suffered two blowouts and still managed to ride 93 miles before being asked to stop by support crews.  Sunday morning, he was back in the saddle and finished all 72 miles in time to catch the final bus back to Houston.  

Ansel pedaled a hand crank bike that was more suited to going around the block than to Austin.  The gears did not work properly and his bike made an extremely difficult task harder than it should have been.  Ansel has limited resources and has already talked about how excited he is about riding in general and the MS150 for next year.  I am asking for donations to help Ansel buy a new bike.  A decent hand crank bike costs aprox. $3,000.  Any donations in excess of the cost of the bike will be contributed to the MS Society.  An account has been established at West University Bank and checks should be payable to Ansel Michaels.  Donations can be sent to:

"Thank You!","Dear Messer's Skilling and Lay,

I heard a song with the lyrics ""how can I say thanks for all the things you've done for me"", I'm pretty sure it's by Andre Crouch.  Let me thank you for the help and loving kindness you and ENRON has shown to me during the period after the devasting floods.  I've never worked for such a wonderful company before, the people here in every walk of life are so very friendly.  The scriptures speaks of drawing people toward you with loving kindness, and you certainly have here at ENRON.  The people that i've met here want to be here and that's a good sign.  One morning on the elevator a lady was singing on the way to her floor, i didn't recognize the tune right away, probably because it was early morning, the tune turned out to be ""OKLAHOMA"" so I joined her, she invited me to come and be a part of the ENRON CHOIR.  Just  the other day you Mr. Skilling passed my desk and asked had my group just moved to the 31st floor, i've only been here at ENRON since January '01 and wasn't aware that my group had moved from the 29th floor.  My Grandmother always used to tell me as a child, ""you better keep a thought in mind, that someones watching you, and they want to be just like you, setting their examples by you, and they're never gonna miss a single thing you do.  And I live by that today.  Well I can be a little longwinded,  but remember:

If I can help somebody  as I pass along,
If I can cheer somebody with a word or song,
If I can can show somebody that he's traveling wrong,
Then my living shall not be in vain.

And you both have certainly obeyed that dictum.


God Bless You Both,

"Great Message - Thank you","Mr. Skilling,

I am new to Enron (about 2 months) and I would like to say how pleased I was by your presentation to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco last week.

Despite the obvious hostility you faced from some of the attendees, I felt you skillfully and professionally delivered a message that is very important for the people of California to hear.  If they listened to what you said, they should have learned a great deal and based on my listening to some of the audience during and after your presentation it seemed apparent that many of them did understand and accepted your message.

Keep voicing the same message, I know we in Government Affairs certainly will and I appreciate your support in light of the emotional environment the energy community currently finds itself operating.  I am sorry I wasn't able to meet you in our office in San Francisco prior to your address, perhaps another time. 

Kind Regards,

Dave Perrino

"t,h: Eyeforenergy Update","Just over two weeks after the tragic and unforgettable events of the 11th
September, we can see that the energy industry, as much as any other, has
had to take stock of itself and all facets of its future direction in the
global marketplace.  One of the immediately apparent effects of the
terrorist attacks is financial uncertainty, which is being felt everywhere,
not just in the United States.  Indeed, the International Monetary Fund has
already forecasted that recovery from the slowdown in the growth of the
global economy has effectively been postponed by several months.

It is clearly vital that everyone in this industry keeps abreast of the
latest developments, which has led us to introduce the new category of
Financial News to the Eyeforenergy website, as well as to our free Daily
News subscription service.  You can subscribe to Daily News here -
http://www.eyeforenergy.com/newsletter.shtml.  Existing subscribers will
automatically have this category added, but there will shortly be a

  Issue for: June 2001       Is Your Company Ready to go Mobile?   Information Anytime, Anywhere.  Mobile devices enable an organization to take its traditional computing infrastructure and existing data, and extend it to the furthest reaches of its business.  Your company can place the information and services  in the hands of those making critical business decisions and serving customers any time, anywhere.   No matter where someone works, mobile devices enable them to access the information and services they need to get their job done faster with higher quality.

ESX Donated Web Site Design and Services to the Houston SPCA   ESX just launched a new web site developed for the Houston Society  for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA).  ESX, as a donation to support the non-profit organization, provided an entirely new site including creative design and the technology platform used for content management.   ESX developed the new site using our Community Catalyst Platform (Catalyst), a content management tool.  Using the Catalyst, the SPCA will be able to  delegate control over sections of the site to volunteers, who will then be able to easily update the content using a web browser.        Take a look at the new Houston SPCA web Site.      Updating Existing Software  Upgrading from DOS to Windows, or Web Enabling    Deciding to migrate existing software applications to a new platform is a big decision.  However, a lot of benefits are gained from doing it. A web interface can give legacy applications a modern graphical interface, deliver them to employees' desktops  regardless of platform, and grant secure access to distributed databases across the enterprise. Portions of the programs can be exposed over the Internet, allowing  high-value self-service transactions. This lowers the required number of customer service personnel, and adds a new dimension to the way customers and vendors can  interact with your business. Elements of your existing software can often be re-used as the foundation for the upgraded solution.      Vis it  our web site today to find out how we can help you map your migration path.

"From FoxFire, To an MBA -- I've Come A Long Way","Mr. Skilling,

I realize this message may seem quite unexpected, but
I could not resist.  It's been a long time since I
knew you at FoxFire Cabins.  Since then I have
completed my undergraduate degree at Trinity
University and recently my MBA at the University of
Texas San Antonio.  In my current job search for a
marketing career, I found a marketing position open at
Enron and applied for it.  As I researched the
company, one that I have watched in the past because
of your connection, I saw that you are now President
and CEO.  Your success is quite remarkable.
I just wanted to re-introduce myself to you as an
adult and recent graduate and hope that somewhere in
the future there may be an opportunity to work at
Enron.  Also, as a very successful MBA yourself, I
welcome any advice you may provide a newcomer to the
business world.  Hope you are doing well with all your
endeavors.

Sincerely,
Leslye Kellner

"Policy Committee Review - Analyst/Associate Program PRC Process","Stan felt it would be appropriate for the Policy Committee to review the attached changes to the Analyst / Associate PRC process, prior to execution.  In summary, the following modifications have been developed by the heads of the AAPRC Committees (Horton, Kean, and Sherriff) and A/A Program Management (Lemmons):

?	Most cross-calibration will be at the business unit level, since this is where the best interaction and information gathering occurs.  Steps to ensure consistency across the business units are outlined in the memo.  The final PRC meeting will focus on business unit ranking distributions, and the names/attributes of the top performers across the company.
?	The PRC committees have been expanded to improve the quality of representation, and to reflect the diversity of our workforce.  The additions were selected from a pool of high performing VPs and Directors.  To ensure fairness, only VPs and Directors will provide representation on the AAPRC Committee.  
?	An attachment has been included to clarify program tenure and promotion criteria.

Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss by mid-day Wednesday, May 9.  We are planning to release this information to the memo distribution list that evening.

Regards,
Billy

"Gerald Smith","Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

Jeff,
 
Enron just lost one of the best  thinkers, innovators, doers, and people I've ever worked with. It is a great  loss for a company you've worked so hard to build up and I'm not sure they can  recover or prosper.
 
I've still got a note to call  you and see if we can get together for dinner when I'm in Houston. I want to see  this house you've built and catch up. Let me know the best way to reach you  now.

"FW: reliability legislation","Jeff,

I look forward to our call Thursday regarding the Enron position on electric
reliability legislation and NERC's role. Here is a marked up copy as well as
a clean copy showing the latest proposal that we would expect NERC to offer
up. This is apparently still a very different approach from that proposed by
PJM.

Subject: reliability legislation


John,

This is the shorter version of the reliability language that is under
discussion.  It's redlined to show the changes from the longer version.
It was developed by lawyers for EEI, APPA and the Canadian Electricity
Association, with our encouragement and advice.  In the Senate hearing
last week I told Senator Bingaman that I thought we could develop
shorter language that still contained the essentials we need for an SRO.
I believe this draft would do that.  We've asked for comment from all
concerned by tomorrow.  Early returns indicate that all who support the
current language will also support the shorter version.  It is unclear
whether we will pick up any additional supporters (like ELCON, Enron, or
EPSA), although some of them have said the draft is a step in the right
direction.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	Enron Property & Services Corp. New 45,000 S.F. Service
Center Developement at Beltway 8 and Clay Road

Robert , we have been asked by Henry Terech Jr. and Lance McCarthy of
Enron Property & Services Corp. to submit a proposal to construct on
behalf of Enron a 45,000 square foot service center along the Beltway 8
just south of Clay Road. Enron would purchase the land and finance the
project and we would take the lead role as Developement Manager and
assist Enron in the design, construction and developement of the
project. This is a piece of business that we want and we are uniquely
qualified to execute. As you know, we have developed over 1,000,000
square feet of new industrial and service center space in this immediate
area the last three years and can provide alot of value to Enron based
on our experience. We have submitted a preliminary budget and will
follow up with Henry and Lance next week with a formal proposal.

Please let me know your thoughts. Thanks.

"Moody""s Annual Review Meeting","Jeff:

Thank you for agreeing to spend a few minutes on Tuesday, April 17 with Moody's Investor Service.  You are scheduled to speak at noon in room EB50M.  To put the day into context, Moody's will have heard prior to your session presentations from Andy and Ben on 2000 results, Mike McConnell on Global Markets, and Jeff McMahon on Wholesale Services.  Our afternoon session will include presentations from Dan Leff on EES, Rod Hayslett on ETS, Kevin Hannon on EBS and Rick Buy on RAC.

In attendance from Moody's will be (in order of rank) Mike Foley - Group Managing Director, John Diaz - Managing Director, and Stephen Moore - Relationship Manager (our analyst).  Diaz and Moore are very familiar with the Enron credit profile.  Foley is their boss.  He apparently is the leader of their ratings committee.  He has not historically attended our meetings.

Key messages for you to hit (which will have already been touched upon by Andy and reinforced throughout the day) include:

Enron's core businesses - have never been better.  We are the market leader in gas and power by a wide margin;
Portland General - we will ultimately divest of this entity and are disappointed that the Sierra Pacific transaction was derailed by regulatory hurdles.  However, PG provides considerable, stable cash flows;
International Asset Sales - we are still committed to liquidating our interests in low returning investments.  Market problems have delayed our M&A effort but we expect movement in the next 12-24 months;
Credit Profile is critical to core businesses - we protect our credit rating as a matter of corporate policy.  Our asset sale and corresponding capital redeployment strategy is based in part to allow us to either reduce leverage or to invest in areas with stronger cash flows thereby improving our key coverage ratio;  and 
Issue Resolution Ongoing - we have some issues (such as California, Dabhol, and Azurix) which are important and are receiving the attention of top management.  They will be covered by Ben and Rick Buy's group.  The main message is that they are not representative of our core business.

If you have any questions, please call me at x31770 or (713) 962-4013 (cell phone).

Thanks,
Tim

Woody,
Good work on making contact with Joe Parks and successfully recruiting
him as a new member of EWooglin.com.
On the strength of your success, I started searching the Internet and
Louisville for Caldwell Willig.  The last time I saw him was in NYC in
the late seventies...the result of a chance meeting on the street after a
get together of metropolitan area Betas.  Zeebs will remember.  It was
the night I told the Long Island duck joke at a crowed restaurant in his
home town (inhibitions were low as usual).
""Where is Caldwell Willig?""  Is this our Caldwell Willig
(http://louisville.bcentral.com/louisville/stories/1998/08/03/story6.html
), or is our Caldwell a ""Jr."", ""II"", ""III"" or 'IV""?
Any insight brothers?...let me know.

"re: flood assistance","Jeff-
thank you for the $1000.
Many of us have suffered thousands of dollars worth of damage in the flood-
i lost my car, and my entire ground floor of my house (sheetrock, hardwood floors,
refrigerator, stove, tile floor in the kitchen, marble around the fireplace, furniture and 9 area rugs (oriental).

What i could really, really use is immediate low interest money-
is there a method in which we can borrow short term money until FEMA comes through?

I have approximately $35,000 worth of damage in my home currently-
They have removed my sheetrock, insultation, and hardwood floors-what's left of my furniture is piled in my garage
I am in the ""drying out"" process

I could use an interim loan against whatever i could borrow against-
i only have $8,000 in my 401k-but i do have some enron stock-
Could enron loan us money at a low rate against our stock or something for a three month period?

I live in west u-the 500 year flood zone-I did not have flood insurance. Never occured to me that i would need it!
thank you-

The attached  ""Rough & Tumble"" is an electronic clipping service targeted at California  politicos and policy wonks.  It carried the LA Times version of the Lockyer  comments a couple days ago.  Today, it has the NY Times article on Ken  Lay.  It's pretty clear that in the near-term, Enron and it's  leadership are at risk of being engulfed in a political firestorm  which bounces from coast to coast, gaining strength each step of the  way.  
 
However, it  is the long-term challenge that draws my attention.  From my research  to date, I am left with the strong impression that the Enron's capacity  for acquiring, distilling and assessing business information is much  stronger than it's abilities with public policy information.  
 
Ken Lay,  you and your team have shaped a innovative and entrepreneurial  company rooted in agile arbitrage of business knowledge.  Like  Goldman Sachs, it is hard for the ""man on the street"" to understand  precisely what Enron does.  However, because of your presence in  businesses that play out daily in homes, schools and small  businesses, Enron will be scrutinized in a way the Goldman couldn't imagine  in it's worst nightmares.
 
From my  perspective, the success of Enron's business model demands a sure  footing in both business and public policy.  Going  forward, these two areas of expertise need  become intertwined to assure the success of the highly  sophisticated, ethical, innovative and insightful global corporation  known as Enron.
 
I would like  to help you succeed with this challenge.  I look forward to our  discussions.

Companies pushed up price of power -- After months of investigation,  state regulators say they have evidence suggesting that power companies have  deliberately driven up wholesale electricity prices. Now they must decide  whether those companies have done anything illegal. State Attorney General Bill  Lockyer said Thursday he believes the evidence ``strongly suggests'' power  companies acted illegally to drive up prices. He has said that he would love to  put top energy executives in jail. Brandon  Bailey and Chris O'Brien in the San Jose  Mercury  -- 5/25/01 
Davis blackout warnings -- a significant policy change aimed  at minimizing business and consumer disruptions, Gov. Gray Davis ordered state  officials Thursday to enact a three-tier blackout warning system. Forecasts of  blackouts will be issued 48 hours beforehand, Davis said. General areas will be  identified in warnings issued 24 hours before likely outages. Precise locations  will be announced an hour before the power is cut, he said. Dan Morain and Nancy  Vogel in the Los Angeles  Times  Greg Lucas and Lynda Gledhill in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Noam Levey and  Dion Nissenbaum in the San Jose  Mercury  John Hill in the Sacramento  Bee  Ed Mendel in the San  Diego Union  Robert Garrett in the Riverside  Press  Michael Coit in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Davis' popularity plunges in poll -- With California's energy crisis  mounting, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has suffered a precipitous fall in his job  approval rating and image among state residents, according to a Field Poll  released yesterday. For the first time since his November 1998 election, more  Californians have an unfavorable view of Davis' performance than favorable.  Carla Marinucci in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Hallye Jordan in the  San Jose  Mercury  John Marelius in the San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Poll puts Riordan, Davis in tight race -- Californians' assessment of Gov.  Gray Davis has plummeted drastically as he has struggled to handle the state  energy crisis, placing outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan in a virtual  dead heat with him for the 2002 governor's race, according to a Field Poll  released Thursday. Though Riordan has given no clear indication that he intends  to run for governor, 42 percent of registered voters said they would support the  Republican mayor should he challenge Davis, the Democratic incumbent.  Forty-three percent said they would vote for Davis. Emily  Bazar in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
California to gain from GOP's loss -- A single party switch in the Senate  on Thursday handed California's Democratic Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara  Boxer new clout with key leadership roles likely on issues ranging from military  base closings to environmental cleanups. Vermont Sen. James Jeffords'  announcement that he was quitting the Republican Party to be an independent  affiliated with Democrats set up a takeover in which the Democrats, with a de  facto 51-49 majority, will assume all Senate leadership posts and committee  chairs. Bill Hillburg in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
PUC and 'baseline' rates -- Nine days after structuring the  largest electricity rate increase in California history, state regulators on  Thursday launched a reexamination of the unpopular baselines used to determine  how much each residential customer will pay. If the indicators are revised  upward, as most expect, that would grant some customers relief from the rate  hike but could necessitate future ones to generate enough revenue for power  purchases. Tim Reiterman in the Los Angeles  Times  Michael Bazeley in the San Jose  Mercury  Carrie Peyton in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Enron Bush  -- Curtis H?bert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely  settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone  conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest electricity  trader, the Enron Corporation. Mr. H?bert, chairman of the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, said that Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's,  offered him a deal: If he changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron  would continue to support him in his new job. Lowell  Bergman and Jeff Gerth in the New York Times   -- 5/25/01 
Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman Davis has plenty of company in  depths of poll --  The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in the  dumper was quick and blunt. ""Tell me something I don't already know,"" adviser  Paul Maslin said after being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed  Davis' job rating down 18 points since January. ""None of this is news to us,""  Maslin said. Matier & Ross in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Water and power -- The California Public Utilities Commission authorized an increase in  American States Water Co.'s rates at the Bear Valley Electric customer service  area of its Southern California Water Co. unit to recover $2.4 million in  deferred electric power costs. The amount will be recovered from customers over  a five-year period. Sam Favate; Dow  Jones Newswires  -- 5/25/01 
Muni power  -- Gov. Davis said he received a pledge Thursday from municipal utility  officials that their agencies will sell excess power to the state at prices much  lower than in the past. Despite simmering resentment at subjecting their  customers to rolling blackouts, the muni officials promised Davis they will keep  cooperating with the state. Municipal utility customers, including those in the  Modesto, Turlock and Merced irrigation districts, will continue to face power  blackouts, officials said afterward. Jim  Miller in the Modesto Bee   -- 5/25/01 
Edison merit raises -- Southern California Edison, which  is struggling to stay out of bankruptcy, will hand out $19 million in merit  raises to its 12,000 employees today, but top executives will forgo the raises  because of the company's financial woes. Edison has doled out hefty merit raises  in the past. But this year, the company will pay the minimum under its variable  compensation program, which rewards employees for meeting certain company goals.  Kate Berry in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01
Cities with own utilities ask FERC to bar blackouts -- More than 15 California cities  that have municipal utilities, including Anaheim, are asking federal regulators  to exempt them from electricity blackouts ordered by the state's Independent  System Operator. The city of Vernon was first to ask the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission to rule that the ISO cannot force it to participate in  California's rolling blackouts to serve demand in other areas. Vernon's utility  argued that it was ridiculous to subject its customers to blackouts when it had  enough power to keep the lights on. Amy Strahan  Butler in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Utility tax windfall -- As electricity rates rise,  consumers will get hit with a double whammy because of an obscure utility bill  tax that many California cities have quietly been collecting for years. A member  of the state Board of Equalization charges that some cities will reap windfalls  from the utility user tax, and he is backing a grass-roots movement to slash or  repeal it. Few local governments are hurrying to forfeit the money, saying that  they need it to pay their own higher energy bills. Wendy  Thermos in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
An air of discontent over diesel backups -- Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday  that he may ask companies to run their emergency generators during Stage 3  electricity alerts as a way to stave off blackouts. And when blackouts do occur,  thousands of tractor-trailer-size generators will whir to life, powering  elevators and lights, hospital equipment, even assembly lines. But that prospect  has created major concerns. Most of those industrial- strength generators run on  diesel oil, a highly polluting fuel. Because they were intended for emergency  use, generators have escaped most environmental regulations. What's more, they  are likely to be called into service on the hottest, smoggiest days of the year.  Carolyn Said in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Power price controls -- The House Energy and Commerce  Committee delayed consideration of a major energy bill Thursday as Republicans  and Democrats met privately to explore a possible compromise placing price  controls on soaring wholesale electric rates on the West Coast. The negotiations  hinted at a possible watershed change in the Republicans' staunch opposition to  price controls. An earlier effort to include such controls in the bill turned  contentious and was defeated on a mostly partisan vote in subcommittee. Les Blumenthal in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
For seniors, the heat can kill, doctors warn -- As summer slouches toward  Sacramento amid a drumbeat of calls to conserve electricity, doctors and  advocates for the elderly are sounding a counter-theme. Heat can kill. And most  often, it kills seniors. Year after year, heat waves around the United States  are deadlier than hurricanes or floods, tornadoes or earthquakes, according to  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Carrie Peyton and Nancy Weaver  Teichert in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Outages could be fatal for disabled -- Around the clock, an electric  pump supplies supplementary oxygen to 66-year-old Benny Pritchett's diseased  lungs. Pritchett worries that a rolling blackout might kill him. ""The  electricity goes out, I'm a dead man,"" said the San Bernardino apartment dweller  and former chain-smoker. ""I've got a (back-up) oxygen tank. It lasts two hours.  When it runs out, I'm dead."" Rolling blackouts aren't expected to last much more  than an hour, say Southern California Edison officials, but their Web site  recommends that any customer dependent on electrically operated life-support  equipment buy an emergency generator. Richard  Brooks in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Gasoline prices -- Average gasoline prices statewide are nearly $2 a gallon, and the Los  Angeles region has once again been dubbed the nation's hub of traffic  congestion. So, what's a good Southern Californian to do? Plan a road trip.  Hugo Martin in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Offshore drilling -- A federal advisory panel Thursday urged the Bush administration to  identify the five most promising areas to drill for natural gas in coastal  waters off California and other states, which have been off limits to drilling  for nearly 20 years. Citing the nation's unmet energy needs, the advisory group  to Interior Secretary Gale A. Norton suggested that locating the top reservoirs  of natural gas would help determine if there ""are grounds and support for a  limited lifting of"" moratoriums on offshore drilling. The ban now covers 610  million acres of ocean off the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Kenneth Weiss in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Judge demands straight answers from El Paso Corp. -- An irate judge threatened  yesterday to subpoena the president of a Texas energy firm accused of  manipulating California natural gas prices, saying he couldn't get straight  answers out of another high-ranking company executive. The eruption by Curtis  Wagner Jr., the administrative law judge presiding over a federal probe of  alleged market manipulation by El Paso Corp., prompted the company to schedule  voluntary testimony by President William Wise today in Washington, D.C. Bernadette Tansey in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
El Paso executive and collusion -- The head of a Texas energy  conglomerate personally endorsed a deal between two subsidiaries accused of  manipulating the natural gas market in Southern California to drive up prices, a  senior official of the firm testified Thursday. The testimony in a trial-like  hearing before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission raised questions about  whether top officials of Houston-based El Paso Corp. violated FERC rules  requiring arm's-length dealings within a corporate family. The admission by El  Paso executive Ralph Eads marked a shift from his previous testimony and was  elicited through sharp questioning by an angry judge who threatened to subpoena  Eads' boss. Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Riverside no blackouts -- Southern California Edison won't  immediately challenge Riverside's decision against using rolling blackouts to  save energy this summer, a spokesman said Thursday. Edison doesn't care how the  city of Riverside curtails its energy use as long as the city makes the required  cuts during a statewide power shortage, Edison spokesman Steve Hansen said.  Dan Lee in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Energy crisis hits muni bonds -- Investors fled the California  municipal bond market last month, taking with them a net $3.5 billion, their  departure prompted in part by the state's energy crisis and taxes, a fund  analysis firm said Thursday. The withdrawals in April marked the worst such  outflow in years, and it comes as the state is preparing this August to issue a  record $13.4 billion in bonds to bail out utilities. Loretta Kalb in the Sacramento Bee   -- 5/25/01 
With a perfectly negative crisis record, Davis desperate for a  win -- So far, Gov. Gray Davis has amassed an unblemished record in  his handling of the energy crisis. Not one major aspect of the situation has  moved in the positive direction Davis said -- and clearly hoped -- it would, to  wit: Dan Walters in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Hot days don't cut the power -- A combination of factors kept the  state's beleaguered system out of the red this time. The heat wave didn't hit  all areas of the state at the same time, and cooler weather in the Pacific  Northwest got power flowing from that region to California again. Also, there  have been no new power-plant malfunctions, and many of the smaller generating  facilities that were AWOL a few weeks ago, when the last blackouts hit, are  operating again. A huge potential contributor to blackout avoidance -- but one  that's difficult to quantify -- is conservation. Jack  Katzanek in the Riverside  Press  -- 5/25/01 
Long Beach Boeing layoffs -- Reflecting a sagging market for  100-seat jetliners, the Boeing Co. will lay off about 600 employees this year at  its commercial factory in Long Beach, the company confirmed Thursday. That  decision followed an internal study by Boeing that was completed earlier this  year, said spokesman Warren Lamb, who did not elaborate. Ian Hanigan in the Long Beach Press  --  5/25/01 
Hahn --  His job is to both prosecute and defend. And with that tricky mandate, Los  Angeles City Atty. James Kenneth Hahn for 16 years has led a law office that, in  sheer numbers, would rank among the biggest in the country. With some 450  attorneys, responsibility for both criminal and civil cases, and an annual  budget of $70 million, the office, like the city it serves, is big, diverse,  complex. But a review of Hahn's record suggests that his performance has been  mixed--deliberate and plodding, pragmatic and obstinate. Greg Krikorian and Patrick  McGreevey in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn and housing -- It doesn't fire up voters like a  stump speech on crime, schools or traffic congestion. But the sheer magnitude of  the city's housing shortage has placed it squarely--albeit quietly--on the  agendas of both candidates running for mayor of Los Angeles. Eight years of a  widely criticized lack of mayoral attention to the housing problem combined with  a high concentration of low-wage workers has earned Los Angeles a reputation as  one of the most unaffordable, overcrowded metropolitan centers in the country,  plagued by low home ownership rates and slum conditions. Lee Romney in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Villaraigosa and Hahn annd crime and gangs -- Mayoral candidates Antonio  Villaraigosa and City Attorney James Hahn continued Thursday to compare their  plans to deal with crime as they near the June 5 runoff election. Hahn, filing  papers in court to seek injunctions against two Wilmington gangs, touted his  efforts over the past several years to control gang activity throughout the  city. ""The root of the violence is drugs and ... for turf and control,"" Hahn  said of the two gangs -- but which, he added, applies to most gangs in the city.  Rick Orlov in the Los Angeles  Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Dean Andal  -- State Board of Equalization member Dean Andal is expected to announce today  that he plans to run for state controller next year. The 41-year-old Republican  from Stockton said he will run on a platform that includes lowering utility  taxes paid by residents and businesses in Los Angeles, which are 10% and 12.5%,  respectively. The story is in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Jim Rogan  -- President Bush on Thursday nominated former Congressman James Rogan to be  undersecretary of commerce for intellectual property and director of the U.S.  Trademark Office. The job pays $130,200 a year. Bush's selection of Rogan, which  will require confirmation by the Senate, could be a positive sign for Hollywood,  which has been lobbying for increased enforcement of copyright laws, including a  crackdown on Internet piracy. Bill Hillburg in  the Los  Angeles Daily News  -- 5/25/01 
Living wage -- While attorneys speculated on the constitutionality of Santa Monica's  newly approved living wage law, hotel housekeeper Blanca Mendez was just hoping  Thursday that she can benefit if a raise to $10.50 an hour goes into effect next  summer at large downtown and beach-side businesses. ""It would be fantastic,""  said Mendez, who now earns $8.50 an hour after seven years at the Streamline  Moderne-style Shangri-La Hotel near the ocean. ""The economy is very difficult;  everything is getting expensive, like gas, like energy."" Oscar Johnson and Ofelia  Casillas in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
9 tribes' casino plans put on hold -- Gov. Gray Davis won't approve any  more agreements with Indian tribes to allow casinos until the federal courts  resolve a legal challenge to California's Indian gaming law. So far, the  governor's moratorium on new Indian gaming compacts, announced in a letter to  nine California tribes, doesn't appear to affect three Sonoma County tribes that  have announced plans for casinos. But it could delay the progress of the nine  other tribes that have asked the governor to negotiate gaming agreements,  including the Round Valley tribe in Mendocino County. Steve Hart in the Santa Rosa Press   -- 5/25/01 
Charity foundations growth -- California's charitable  foundation assets--which were relatively modest as recently as two decades  ago--are now growing at a rate faster than those in the rest of the country,  according to a study by the new USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy. In  1978, California held 8% of national foundation assets; in 1998 it accounted for  14%, the study said. During the same period, the state's share of foundation  grants grew from 7% to 11% of total giving nationwide, it said. ""California is  catching up and jumping forward,"" said Marcia K. Sharp, a research fellow at the  USC Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy, and a co-author of the study.  Anne-Marie O'Connor in the Los Angeles  Times  -- 5/25/01 
Documents seized in S.F. minority contract probe are  inadmissible -- In a  potential blow to prosecutors, a U.S. judge said that federal investigators  violated a San Francisco city official's privacy rights when they searched her  office looking for evidence of fraud in a city minority contracting program. The  FBI seized hundreds of pages of records from the San Francisco Human Rights  Commission office of chief contract compliance officer Zula Jones in August  1999. Chuck Finnie and Lance Williams in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Feinstein fast-tracks water storage plans -- California can't forestall a  water crisis without building more storage facilities, Sen. Dianne Feinstein  said yesterday in responding to environmental critics of her bill to reauthorize  the CalFed ecosystem restoration program. Eric Brazil in the San  Francisco Chronicle  Michael Gardner in the  San  Diego Union  -- 5/25/01 
Californians' recycling efforts hit skids -- Californians are recycling a  lower percentage of redeemable plastic, glass and aluminum beverage containers  than they have in more than a decade, the state Department of Conservation  reported Thursday. While officials note the recycling drop is partially due to  an increasing number of products available for redemption, they also point to  research suggesting consumers' habits may be slipping. Ed  Fletcher in the Sacramento  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
UC admissions policy -- A UC Berkeley request to be  exempted from a University of California admissions policy is creating concern  among administrators and faculty who object to looking at one campus in  isolation. Instead, they said, the Berkeley request probably should be folded  into a systemwide review of admissions already under way. Tanya Schevitz in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 
Irvine cash crop: business -- Irvine One of the largest  commercial developments in the county could be built in the next five to seven  years, replacing checkered fields of strawberries and other crops. The 670 acres  of fields and a scattering of industrial buildings just outside Irvine's  northeastern border is large enough to host 12 Disneylands, but The Irvine Co.  has other plans. Laura Corbin, Jennifer Hieger  and Elizabeth Aguilera in the Orange County  Register  -- 5/25/01 
Like a Rolling Tone -- It looked like a scene from the  hotel karaoke lounge, where the microphone-hogging guy won't stop belting Tom  Jones tunes and a few cocktail-sipping patrons keep their eyes glued to their  drinks in embarrassment. But it was official state business at the state Capitol  on Thursday when members of the Assembly attempted to pay tribute to Bob Dylan  on his 60th birthday by feebly singing along with his 1973 recording of ""Forever  Young."" Lesli A. Maxwell in the Fresno  Bee  -- 5/25/01 
Joe Lockhart -- Barely six months after joining Oracle Corp. as a communications  consultant to chief executive Larry Ellison, former White House press secretary  Joe Lockhart has left the database software firm. Both sides yesterday denied a  rift between the two men and blamed Lockhart's frequent trips from his home in  Washington, D.C., to Oracle's Redwood Shores headquarters for the departure.  Kelly Zito in the San  Francisco Chronicle  -- 5/25/01 More..

"RE: [smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush","Hess,  I vaguely remember Gary Vale and concur with your sentiments.  I also
appreciate your words and thoughts on the Sept 11th tragedy.  It has changed
us all for a very long time to come.  I am not looking forward to my first
flight since Sept 11th tonight to Dallas.  The good of all of this (if there
is such a thing) is that it has brought this country closer than it's been
since WWII.  There's always a silver lining, sometimes just hard to find.

Subject: Re: [smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush

Dear Beta Bros,

     I fully intended to respond to Woody's e-mail and forward about
President Bush much more quickly than this.  I noticed that there was no
response out there when Woody posted this and I didn't want him to
feel so lonely, so here goes... (warning: this is not lighthearted fare!)
     I'm sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since
September 11th.  That day was a vivid reminder that I don't have a choice in
determining how or when I'm going to die (barring suicide of course), but I
do have a choice about how I'm going to live.  September 11th and the events
which continue to unfold have caused me to focus a whole lot more on what's
truly important in life- family, relationships, faith.
     Believing that those terrorists were willing to die for a lie, I've
been forced to ask myself- what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe
is the TRUTH?
     For many of you guys, I confess, I failed to personally share what I
believed was the truth, even back in college.  I was not willing to
sacrifice acceptance- a hard thing for a college kid to give up. Forgive me
for that.
     [Unbelievably, just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted
by a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you
may have known. He was a football player and on my freshman floor at SMU.  I
wish I had room to tell you Gary's whole story.  In short, we were friends,
I watched him begin trashing his life in the Spring semester but failed to
try to help much.  Gary became an alcoholic, just sobering up three years
ago.  But, too late to recover from damage that had been done.  He walked
into my life again two months ago when, through a series of ""coincidences,""
he ended up at our church.  His father just called to tell me that Gary died
last night.  I can't help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided
had I done more in the Spring of '72? So, it's now with grief and an even
greater sense of urgency that I write this today.]
     If recent events have moved you to a place of searching and seeking,
please read on and allow me a few moments of your time to share what I've
experienced as real truth about real life.
     I've found the evidence to be very compelling that this planet and all
it contains (including us), is the design of a very imaginative Creator.
That Creator is not an impersonal force, or removed and simply ""watching us
from a distance."" He is a personal being who knows His creation and
desperately desires to be known by them.  He so much desires to be known by
us that, in a manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to
face, He became a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
     Some think perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet.
However, I realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not
accept that.  Jesus claimed to be God; and he claimed to hold the key to
people's eternal destiny.  Jesus'claims left only three options.  He was
either a liar (the worst kind because he deceived people about their
eternity), a lunatic, or, he was who he said he was- he was Lord.
     Could God love me that much, to go that far?  To allow His own Son to
come and show us and teach us what God is like? To die on a cross to pay the
penalty of my sin and obtain my forgiveness? To rise from the dead to secure
the opportunity to have a personal relationship with God both now and
forever?
     Personally, I've found all of the above to be true.  God is a personal
God.  Jesus is Lord.  And, God does love me that much- to suffer the death
of His own Son in order to offer real life (now and forever) to me and
anyone else who is willing to do just one thing...  receive that gift; just
accept Him.
     A number of years ago I did accept Him.  And, in doing that, I've
experienced everything He said to be true.  Life has not been problem-free.
That's not what He promised, in fact, Jesus assured us that we will have
problems in this life.  But, He has always personally been there. He has
always given His strength, wisdom, guidance, peace, contentment, patience,
encouragement, hope, and love. [These Scriptures tell about it: John 3:16,
Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23, Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 13, and many more]
     As Woody's e-mail stated, it is encouraging to know where this
President is turning at such a time as this.  Thank God that's a personal
relationship that's offered to anyone who seeks it, not just the big boys.
Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these thoughts.
      If you'd like to talk more about this, I'd love to do so.  My phone
number is 918-743-8897 (office), 918-298-6144 (home) and my e-mail addresses
are pastorhess@hotmail.com,or, hess@shbc-tulsa.org.  I wish I could be at

business!  May God bless you all.

Why B2B Enabler Trust Guidelines Are Necessary For
The Long-Term Viability of B2B Ecommerce
by Eliot Cooper, EYQUEM

Today, B2B enablers offer ecommerce value propositions to traditional brick

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

Subject: Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it's time to hump it


As a Beta from the distinguished class of 1973 and a Nebraskan living in
Oklahoma I would like to make a few comments about the letters below from
the distinguished Oklahoma weenie doctor  Bill Miller and sharp tongued very
popular Oklahoman transplanted author the one and only Jim Dent.
First -NEBRASKA did not get stomped.

Second -the great class of 1973 ,(Picture attached) who helped pledged you
arrogant sissies from the classes of 75 and 76, think it's time you get out
the Loving Cup and pass it around again.

Finally- neither Jim Dent or Bill Miller have invited any of the class of 73
who reside in Oklahoma over for -kai- (for Beek that's F&F). But we in the
class of 73 are not bitter even though a visit the beautiful and prestigious
Nichols Hills (Oklahoma's answer to Highland Park) would boost our spirits
in these times.  Anyway I hope I speak for the silent  E-Wooglin.com members
when I say  I'm glad I didn't buy any of that ENRON stock.
Oh and by the way no one need respond to this note as I remain
affectionately yours,  Tom Hosman (that's Space for Beek and #456 for  those
of you who are still counting).

"Redeployment Opportunity - 3 minutes of your time","Jeff,

Behind every successful executives career there is at least one break; one time where someone took a chance on them and they proved them right.  I am a Sr. Specialist with DealBench. With redeployment looming, I have been told to begin looking within Enron for opportunities.  This brings us to this email that I have written you; I am asking you for my chance.

I have a Business degree and 4 years of experience with Deloitte Consulting.  I have nearly 8 months of experience with DealBench, acting as the product development manager, strategist, marketer, nearly everything.  I am flexible, adaptive, intelligent, and quite possibly the hardest worker you have working for you at Enron.  True this is a bold statement, but I firmly believe it and since I've got only a few minutes of your time, I better sell hard!  I have no ego.  I am, after all, only a Sr. Specialist.  I haven't transcended into the Manager/Director level where I have seen others stubbornly think they know everything.  I am hungry; I love the business world and will do whatever it takes to succeed.

I would like to propose myself for an executive-trainee program within your office.  At other companies, I have seen this tool effectively used to help ambitious individuals learn invaluable business skills.  At Deloitte, the program was a year rotation where Senior Consultants would assist the CEO in whatever they could.  I know people that have participated and they have all learned much more than they ever dreamed.   The learning's that I would get from a year within your office would help me immensely as I work myself toward the upper echelons of management.

Bottom Line:
What's in it for you
1)  An excellent member of your team that will help you and your organization succeed
2)  An open channel to the perspective of lower levels within your organization
3)  More ambition in one person than you thought possible

What's in it for me
1)  A once in a lifetime opportunity to learn what it really takes to run a business
2)  Knowledge, knowledge, knowledge

I hope that you will take a few minutes of your time to evaluate this idea.  I truly believe it can become a powerful learning tool within Enron like it has at other companies, and I would be honored to be the first person to participate.  I wasn't sure if I should write this message (your too busy, you don't know me from Adam, blah, blah), but I decided to take a chance.  I hope that you will consider taking a chance on me.

Thanks for your time.  I have attached my resume for your review.

I hope to hear from you soon,
Zach Streight

"Important News For Our Texas Customers","June 8, 2001


Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_1029

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or
concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_1029 or call NewPower
at 877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

"","Gentlemen

I just spoke to Jeff who had just finished his phone call with Dorman (ATT).  Jeff said that Dorman was very interested in our proposal and even had some ideas on expanding the scope of our ideas.  He said that Dorman would like to get together on Weds.  June 6 in Washington DC to continue the discussions.  I'm not quite sure what this means except that it appears that Dorman does have a genuine interest in exploring a big deal with EBS.  So I would recommend that we get together early next week with Jeff and maybe with the Adventis guys and prepare for the 6/6 meeting.

"FW: Enron Guest Speaker","Dear Jeff,
    Thought you'd be interested in seeing the wonderful e-mail response I
received from U.S. Air Force Major Ken Carey  regarding your plans to
address the Washington, D.C. AMS in November. It just arrived late last
evening. This is really above and beyond the call of duty given all that is
on your plate and I can't adequetely thank you for agreeing to do it. I
really passed this on to you with some misgivings, knowing how often I get
requests for talks for which there is just no time---and you're hit with
15,000 times the number of inquiries that pass this desk.  Thanks, again,
Jeff. You are certainly a hit in the meterological community and there is
much interest in what you have to say.  I get such a kick out of my brother!

     I continue to follow the whole California thing and all the news from
Enron via the various business news services.  I still chuckle when I think
of our hikes with Willy to the Watchung Mountains and the various forts and
treehouses we contructed along the way from rejected scrap wood picked up at
construction sites and contrast all that to the lives we lead today.  Who
would have thought??  You're doing a great job in a challenging environment
and I'm sorry to have added anything to an already busy work load with this.
But, I do thank you, Jeff!
     Preparations are underway for Mark and Sukran's visit in September.
Our Sue tells me she's very nice! Look forward to meeting her.
     Take care of yourself, Jeff!

       Love, Tom

Ken,
    I'm absolutely delighted to hear this! You are kind to share the news. I
know Jeff's incredibly busy but am thrilled at his plans to join you.  I'd
love to be there to hear his presentation myself.  I understand that what he
and his colleagues in Houston have done is really something and it should
make for an fascinating evening.  Adding Larry Heitkemper is a coup as well.
Much success with the program and congratulations on the effort you so
graciously put forth to put together a series of really outstanding programs
for the AMS Washington, D.C. chapter, Ken!
     Your kind invitation to visit one of your chapter meetings is noted and
appreciated. Things really hop here and I don't often get out that way.
But, I will definitely keep it in mind and can't thank you enough for the
offer.
     All the very best to you, Ken, and I do hope to see you again sometime
in the future! Have a great 2001-2002 season of meetings!

It looks like we have a tentative meeting with your brother Jeff as our
guest speaker on Friday, November 9th.  Thanks very much for helping us get
Jeff as our guest!  I sure didn't expect to get the Enron President and CEO!
In addition, Larry Heitkemper from Earth Satellite Corporation in Rockville,
Maryland, who works closely with Enron, has also agreed to be our guest.  It
should be an outstanding time had by all!

You'd better promise me that if you have any plans to come to Washington DC
that you let me know so we might have you over for dinner, or at least share
a cup of coffee.  We'd love for you to join us at a DC AMS Chapter meeting.

Take care, let's try to keep in touch, and I wish you very sincerely the
best of luck in your personal and professional endeavors.

Ken


Ken--
    How nice to hear from you and thanks for the picture! I do indeed
remember meeting you (sending the picture was a great idea and helped jog my
failing memory!).  Your words are very kind and I thank you sincerely.
    Let me put a call into my brother Jeff down at Enron and see if there
might be a way they can respond.  It's a fabulous idea for a talk and I know
that Jeff's group in Houston are extremely active in this area.  Will get
back to you with whatever information I can put together.
    Much success to you as well, Ken! It's interesting you've written today
for we've just received word here that one of my most recent interns, having
achieved his meteorological degree at Valparaiso University, has just
officially joined the Air Force, a lifelong ambition and dream come true.
Another of my former interns intends to do the same.
     All the very best, Ken!  I'll get back to you.

                   Tom

Tom

Hello from our Nation's Capital!  You and I met at the AMS Annual Meeting in
San Diego in 1999 (see attached picture of you and I!).  You're very well
known and I applaud all of the good things you're doing for both your
Chicago and national viewers, weather-wise, but, more importantly, your
tremendous and positive community involvement!

 <<Tom Skilling.bmp>>
As a chapter officer with the District of Columbia Chapter of the American
Meteorological Society (DC AMS), I want to get the very best speakers with
inspiring, entertaining, and thought-provoking topics for our chapter
membership.  I can't think of anything much more exciting in our profession
than that of weather derivatives, and the products and services for our
energy and agricultural sector that is a booming part of our field.

I'd like to get someone from Enron to speak at one of our chapter meetings.
I understand you may have an inside track to Enron and I wanted to inquire
if you could help us get an appropriate person to talk to our chapter about
weather for their business ventures.  I'd like to also get someone from the
weather provider perspectives, like a company like EarthSat Corp, so we
could get a better understanding of both the weather provider and customer
perspectives.

I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck with your future
professional and personal endeavors!

Best Regards,
Ken

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"Impact","
Mr. Skilling,

I have been attempting to work with Enron Broadband for over six months;
indeed, we have an 'Agent' agreement.  With the recent market
disequilibrium, it has become next to impossible to close deals with
your company.  Like you, I am a consultant, a deal-broker, a veritable
rainmaker.  Unlike you, I didn't consult with a big firm.  I am
independent an am extremely hungry.

That said, I would love to sit with you to discuss opportunities of
where Enron is going and how they are going to get there.  These
impromptu emails often work and have even afforded me one-on-one chats
with the likes of  VISA founder, Dee Hock!  I can provide further
background information should you be interested in meeting.  I have many
ideas on the telecom future for Enron that are exciting, practical, and
profit mongering.

I'd love the chance to speak with you over the phone, on instant
messenger, or even face-to-face.

With perspicuity and aplomb,

Michael Wilson

"MS Society Opportunity","
Jeff,
 
On Saturday, September 29th, I am being honored with the National Multiple Sclerosis  Society's Hope  Award during their  annual Maxine Mesinger Dinner of  Champions event.  This award is beinggiven to me due to the hard work and  dedication that BMC Software  employees have shown this great cause through the years.  I understand that you were the recipient of this award last year, so you know  that the key to a successful event is the selection of the dinner  committee, which is then used to  build the invitation list and to build excitement for attending the event from  local leaders.  Of course, the  key to successfully developing the dinner committee is the selection of the  Chairman of the committee.
 
I would be honored  if you would agree to serve as the Chairman of the dinner committee.  You were  the first name that came to mind and the best person I could hope for to assure  a successful event. I am told that your personal time commitment would be  very minimal.  It would require your attendance at the dinner event on  September 29th in downtown Houston.  The dinner is typically from 7:00pm until 10:00pm,but the actual ceremony is less  than 30 minutes long with some brief comments by you and then an acceptance  speech given by yours truly.  The primary obligation beyond attending the  event would be to allow us to use your name and signature in sending out the  invitations to the dinner committee members.  I would provide you with a  recommended invitation list. The MS team would make sure that  your time and image would be well respected.
 
Thank you Jeff,
 
Bob

Classes are well underway at MIT.  I wanted to thank you and Lou for your sponsorship and support - a process that I initiated nearly 2 years ago.  This is something I have always wanted to do and the one-year Sloan Fellows Program provided the right window at the right time in my career.  Having a year to concentrate on business study away from the daily rigors of deal making and quarterly earnings targets will allow me to build the skills and thought process necessary to get the most out of the opportunities I will face in the next 15 years of my career.

Schedules did not allow me to stop by your office for a proper thank you and goodbye but I want to be certain you appreciate my intentions after this program has concluded.  I fully intend and expect to return to Enron after the program is over (Summer 2002).  You and Enron have provided me with great opportunities and rewards over the last seven years - I want to continue that relationship.  I look forward to the business problems you will have for me when I return.

I would love for you to come to Cambridge and spend a few hours with our class.  We have a great story to tell.  Our business model and history of innovation is unique and a great lesson.  Perhaps we could coordinate your visit with a recruiting presentation at MIT or Harvard.  Let me know if you are interested and I will work with Sherri.

Thanks again Jeff

I just heard of your resignation. I wanted to personally ""Thank You"" for being such a positive influence for ALL the employees of Enron. You have always carried yourself as ""Enron"" and have helped placing a positive knowledge to the community of what Enron and its employee's truly are.

 I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and in life in general. I am deeply saddened by this news that you are leaving, but can not help but feel happy for you. (as this was your decision)

May God Bless you.

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Carl, I (another card-carryin' Republican who once played the part of Sir H.
Rape Brown de Black Knight in Cumalot) also have apparently changed my ways
of thinking over the years.  And, in these times of PC, one cannot afford
not to -or at least to project a believable image that he/she is a convert.
And right now the National Fraternity is under this same microscope and
acted, though somewhat precipitously, with the ""bigger picture"" in mind.
That's why I made the suggestions which I did.  And, I hope that none of
them - though different than yours - offended you.  I was merely trying to
throw in the benefit/ignorance of my own experiences in such matters.  And,
today, while thinking further own the subject, I thought that as part of the
""game plan"" I suggested last night, the chapter might consider involving
some of its more influential, and credible alums and identify the same type
of alums from the Black fraternity.  Then, when meeting with the
all-important intermediary, a suggested meeting between the alums from the
two frats and the intermediary be made.  I can't decide whether I would want
to suggest including student representatives from the two frats at this
first meeting.  I seem to come down on the play of having a second meeting
with the alums from both frats with the intermediary and include selected
student representatives (non-hotheads from our side) to attend and take an
active role in the negotiations.  From there, if all goes well - a BIG
""if"" - the same groups can then have a big meeting with all members and
pledges from both frats (maybe dangerous) or have separate meetings with
each frat (less volatile) where the enemy representatives attend along with
the intermediary.

"The Morning Market Call - Friday June 1st, 2001"," <<MF June 1st 2001.pdf>>

			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

In comments made by Steve Slifer, Lehman Brothers' economist, he indicates
that the U.S. economy remains in limbo - neither in recession nor in
recovery. After a string of weaker-than-expected economic data, Friday's
employment report came in stronger than expected. Payroll employment fell
19,000 in May, as expected, but there were large net upward revisions of
153,000 to March and April. The unemployment rate fell a tenth, to 4.4%. On
the surface, this suggests strength in the economy; however, the drop was
caused  by a decline in the number of people looking for jobs. This is a
sign of weakness, not strength. However, there has been  a rise in both
major measures of consumer confidence in May, and Congress passed a major
tax cut, including almost a percentage point worth of economic stimulus in
3Q. All of this leaves us where we started: more near-term economic weakness
and another 25 basis point rate cut by the Federal Reserve  on June 27,

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.70%. .
The 5-year is trading at 4.90%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.90 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.94 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS
Oil Services & Drilling J. Crandell, .212.526.4865
Jackups - Market Update
*Net net, we will see a very positive outlook for jackup oriented companies.
We continue to forecast a long cycle, with strong
utilization and rising day rates over the next three or more years and
highly attractive valuations. We continue our strong buy
recommendation on jackup oriented companies Global Marine (GLM $25.50),
Rowan Companies (RDC $29.93), Noble Drilling (NE
$42.84), Ensco (ESV $32.19) and Santa Fe International (SDC $36.97) and
favor those with an institutional presence.

Electronics Manufacturing Services L. Miscioscia, .212.526.3472
Long Term Just Around the Corner
*As near term business signals are mixed and stocks remain volatile, we're
taking a 12 month view that trends for EMS in 02 will be
improve significantly. Thus we're becoming more positive on the outlook for
share price appreciation longer term, given the current
risk reward scenario.
*Our optimism is based on the high level view that U.S. macro economic
trends will strengthen in early 02. While we could see further
weakness in share prices near term, investors will want to position
themselves for the eventual rebound, and calling the bottom has
been very difficult.
*From a micro sense we believe top-tier EMS cos could achieve 20% top and
bottom line growth in 02, y/y, from new outsourcing
wins. Well above many tech end markets. Thus, EMS could become one of the
favored groups within tech.

FOCUS STOCKS
Altera Corp(ALTR) 3 - Market Perform D. Niles, .415.274.5252
Guidance Lowered Yet Again; International Getting Worse (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $24.00 EPS 2000 N/A $0.96 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $67 - 19 EPS 2001 $0.50E $0.45E $0.47E 53.3
Mkt Cap: $9.7B EPS 2002 $0.65E $0.60E $0.62E 40.0
FY: 12/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*Q2 is even worse than we thought due to international, especially Europe,
deteriorating worse than expected. We believe this will be
a pattern across the industry. Revs are now forecast down 25% not 20% q/q
which is worse than the Q1 decline of 22%. Another
indication that it is still to early to return to semis.
*The book-to-bill is still well below 1.0 which implies Q3 revs will
decrease q/q as we previewed. Though orders were somewhat
better for the past several weeks, this is not a trend. April also started
off well.
*Operating margins will probably decrease from 41% in Q2:00 to 18% in Q2:01
assuming layoffs which we believe must be
announced soon.
*Design wins are positioning Altera well for a recovery when the inventory
is gone but the bigger question is how long will that take
and what is the slope of that recovery. We are cutting FY01 EPS from $0.50
to $0.45 and FY02 from $0.65 to $0.60. Demand during
the summer will determine the direction of the next estimate change.

Perspective Check (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $4.61 EPS 2000 N/A -$0.90 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $27 - 5 EPS 2001 -$1.18E -$1.19E -$1.26E N/A
Mkt Cap: $2.8B EPS 2002 -$1.21E -$1.21E -$1.05E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $10 $10
Rank 1 1
*While near term catalysts are tough to identify, we believe revised near
term expectations are achievable and that company specific
bad news is behind us, providing a relatively attractive entry point for
long term investors.
*Management, in our opinion, is doing the right things in this environment,
namely focusing effort and investment on its in-region
operations, paring back cap ex, reducing headcount, and increasing cost
controls.
*Actions indicate a management team that recognizes the realities of the
macro-environment and is focused on delivering EBITDA
and cashflow, with an implied willingness to forego some near term revenue
opportunities to do so, if necessary.
*Shares currently trade at 2.7x 2002E revenue. Our valuation analysis
suggests potential upside of approximately 60% versus
downside of 23% from these levels.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Brokers & Asset Managers M. Constant, .415.274.5379
Brokerage Stocks: What Do We Do Now?
*In the aftermath of the recent rally in brokerage stocks (our Brokers Index
is up 13% since our upgrades on 19-Mar-01 versus a
roughly 8% rise in the S&P 500 index), we are frequently asked whether or
not we would advise ""taking gains"" at current trading
levels. In our view, some of these stocks have begun to discount a
fundamental recovery that is not yet fully substantiated by market
conditions; however, the intermediate-term outlook has become somewhat more
favorable and (perhaps more importantly) current
valuations of certain stocks in our coverage universe still leave room for
incremental upside appreciation potential over the next year
or more, particularly after the modest pull-back that the group experienced
over the last week and a half.

Equity Derivatives/Quant Research J. Hosker, .212.526.7460
Weekly Volatility Commentary
*We recommend buying the underlying index and/or selling implied volatility
on the Utility (UTY) index and Semiconductor (SOX)
index. We recommend selling the underlying index and/or buying implied
volatility on the S&P 500, UK FTSE 100, the Banking
(BKX) index, the Pharmaceutical (DRG) index, the Morgan Stanley Consumer
(CMR) index, the Airline (XAL) index and the
Gold/Silver (XAU) index.
*Near-term one-month at-the-money (ATM) implied volatility for the S&P 500
index increased this week as the market sold off
among concerns about the timing of a potential recovery. One-month ATM
implied volatility for the NASDAQ 100 (NDX) index
increased as the index fell triggered by a reduced profit forecast by SUNW.
We believe that the SPX and NDX will build a base
with interest rate cuts.

Liz Claiborne(LIZ) 1 - Strong Buy R. Drbul, .212.526.4714
Compelling Valuation; Executing Diversification Strategy
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $51.77 EPS 2000 N/A $3.58 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $53 - 34 EPS 2001 $4.05E $4.05E $4.05E 12.8
Mkt Cap: $2.7B EPS 2002 $4.55E $4.55E $4.55E 11.4
FY: 12/31 Price Target $62 $62
Rank 1 1
*We are reiterating our 1 Strong Buy rating and 12 month price target of $62
on Liz Claiborne. We believe the company is making
significant strides towards its goal of becoming the worlds leading branded
fashion apparel company. The company's recent
acquisition of the Mexx Group greatly accelerates the company's
diversification strategy as it increases Liz Claiborne's presence in
international markets to 17% on a pro forma 2000 basis compared to 7% prior
to the acquisition.
*On a valuation basis, Liz Claiborne appears very attractive as it is
trading at a 16% discount on a P/E basis and a 31% discount on an
EV/EBITDA basis to its leading competitor, Jones Apparel Group.
*Over the past six months, Liz Claiborne has lost three key senior
executives. While we believe the company continues to effectively
manage its business and have a high level of confidence in CEO Paul Charron,
we recognize that the uncertainty in senior
management is unsettling and believe the clarification of the situation
could be a catalyst for the shares.

Starbucks Corp(SBUX) 2 - Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255
May Comps at upper-end of our view/Rev's lower-end (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E

Mkt Cap: $7.5B EPS 2002 $0.58E $0.58E $0.57E 33.7
FY: 9/30 Price Target $25 $25
Rank 2 2
*May Comps of 3% were at the upper-end of our forecast but Rev's of 20% were
at the lower-end of targets. Maintain 2-rating & view
that near-term upside is limited given lack of visibility on Comps/Top-line
momentum
*Comps of +3% were at the upper-end of our +1-3% view & targets. Traffic &
Avg check Up. With about 2 1/2% Pricing, Mix was
probably down
*Rev's +20%, below our 22-24% view; this was at the low-end of mgmts target
& the 2nd month in a row of light Revs; this will likely
be focused on
*In June, expect 22-24% Revs on 1) 22% Co-Op Unit grth & 2) Comps of +1-3% -
vs 9% a yr-ago - on about 2% Pricing - about 1/2%
burned in May, & 0-1% Traffic; Traffic comparison similar to May
*Maintain 2-rating. At 36x, Rev's just meeting targets, Comparisons
difficult, No price hikes & Retail environment still
slow/uncertain, near-term upside is limited. But maintain EPS view as Int'l
is solid & lower coffee costs to drive margins

Ulticom Inc(ULCM) 1 - Strong Buy T. Luke, .212.526.4993
Strong 1Q Beats Expectations Once Again; Reit 1 Strong Buy (A,C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $25.12 EPS 2000 N/A $0.22 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $63 - 13 EPS 2001 $0.38E $0.41E $0.22A 61.3
Mkt Cap: $1.1B EPS 2002 N/A $0.48E $0.38E 52.3
FY: 1/31 Price Target $60 $60
Rank 1 1
*Last night, service enabling software leader and our top small cap pick
Ulticom once again exceeded estimates across all key metrics.
We reiterate our 1 Strong Buy rating.
*Revenues of $17.0M easily exceeded our $16.1M estimate, driven by continued
strong sales into the softswitch (Internet offload and
VoIP) and wireless application markets.
*EPS of $0.10 exceeded our est of $0.09 despite lower interest income, on
higher gross margins of 68.2%, vs. 67.9% in 4Q00. ULCM
continues to add functionality to Signalware, boosting margins.
*Visibility at the company remains good, with backlog continuing to exceed
one Q of revenue.
*We believe the outlook for ULCM remains robust given continued growth in
the softswitch and wireless markets. Indeed,
management chose to raise guidance during the call. Our estimates move to
$72.8M/$0.41 from $70.9M/$0.38 in 2001 and to
$98.3M/$0.48 from $95.7M/$0.44 in 2002.

"Re: [smu-betas] successful surgery","Drow
I spent 5 straight days in June playing golf and partying with G'bles and he
never said a word.  I talked to him Sunday night after I got your e-mail.  I
gave him hell for not confiding in me, but I understand his reasons.  I
would probably do the same.  He knows how much he means to all of us.  And
the feeling is mutual.   I'm so happy  to hear all is well.  I talked to
brother Charlie Porter (now a famous KC cardiologist) Sunday and he gave me
some comfort.   G'bles is coming back to KC soon to play more golf.  I can't
wait to give him a hug and let more -kai- flow.  The Beta brothers are the

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

"Home Depot and more","I just wanted to pass you a note on these guys, since we had you call Bob Nardelli a couple of months ago to see what we could get going. Home Depot issued and RFQ and we responded with a non-conforming bid. We have, however, been chosen to exclusively negotiate with them (beat out Reliant and TXU) for their energy spend west of the Mississippi. We are focusing on a spend of about $50mm a year. We are also looking to help them with some of their problems in California, They entered into a number of 1-2 year deals with third party providers that were brokered for them by SRI and as they expire, they don't want to go back to the utilities.

Just wanted to let you know that we are making progress, and at the right time I may ask you to make another call to Nardelli.



New Subjects;

- I also have hooked up with Liz Flynn at Chase. She is an executive vice president and reports directly to Shapiro. She will look to me as the senior Enron contact for our deal and is aware and supportive of the corrective actions we are taking as well as the need for some restructuring. 

- As you know, we have recently closed 3 deals with Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties. We did 5 year deals for their Chicago, NY and Boston based properties. We are in the midst of looking at other regions as well as negotiating a term sheet for an off-balance sheet partnership that would perform DSM and look at Distributed Generation opportunities at their properties. I think it would be great to have you call Sam and say how great it is that we were able to begin doing business together. I will send sheri a note with his number and some deal details if that is acceptible to you.

Thanks,
Jeremy

Boys,
    At the risk of him saying ""It's no big deal fellas"", I need to notify
you that Brother John Grumbles, will be undergoing exploratory heart surgery
via the ole catheter up the leg procedure sometime very soon.  The Drs. are
telling him he's most likely got a partially clogged artery at the bottom of
his heart and if he does, they will proceed with the angioplasty procedure
at the same time.  Dr. Fullerton has already contacted him as have several
of us local guys and I think IT IS A BIG DEAL and I know he would appreciate
a call.  The surgery was actually scheduled for a couple of days ago but was
cancelled at the last minute because of a doctor screw up.
     His phone number is 972 617-2412.  Nothing like a big dose of -kai-when
facing a health problem ya know????   Thanks boys.


Your in -kai-,
Drow

"The Morning Market Call - Thursday September 6th, 2001."," <<MF September 6th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Thursday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

This morning, the non-manufacturing National Association of Purchasing
Managers (NAPM) unexpectedly fell to 45.5 in August from 48.9 in July. New
Orders fell to 45.9 from 48.6 (note that this component is not seasonally
adjusted). The services that reported the most negative environment,
according to this survey, were: communications, real estate and
construction. Blending these data with the manufacturing NAPM, the total
economy NAPM dropped to 46.0 from 47.8 in July.

Tomorrow the Labor Department releases the employment data for August.
Lehman Brothers expects a payroll gain of 28,000 new jobs in the non-farm
sector.

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.40%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.85%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.40%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.57 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.44 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

*Yahoo!'s stock has been extremely weak, down 40% in the past month, and
trading at a 52-week low of $10.64. We view this
pullback as a compelling buying opportunity.
*Much of this decline is attributable to widespread speculation that Yahoo!
will not hit its 3Q estimates due to the eroding advertising
outlook.
*After carefully analyzing our forecast, we believe that a significant
shortfall is unlikely: Our 3Q estimates already factor in the dot-com
meltdown and the prolonged weak economy.
*We recognize that Yahoo!s challenges are formidable and a re-acceleration
in growth may be a few quarters off. However, we
believe that estimates are low enough and that the valuation has become much
more reasonable.
*We believe that the downside on the stock is limited and underpinned by the
potential sale of the company.

both companies. However, we believe that the transition of service from At
Home's infrastructure to a new infrastructure poses
execution risk in the first half of 2002.
*Cox and Comcast notified Excite@Home that they will terminate their
respective agreements with the company effective June 4,
2002. This means that Cox and Comcast must migrate their high speed data
customers from the ATHM platform to new platforms in
the first half of next year, a major undertaking.
*We have revised our forcasts for both companies to reflect, relative to
previous estimates; higher revenue in 2002 and 2003, higher
OCF in 2003, lower HSD net adds in 1H02, and higher capex in 2002.

Major Pharmaceuticals C. Butler, .212.526.4410
Maybe You Did Not Hear..Drugs Might Work in Q4!
*The US Pharma sector is trading at a 12 percent premium to the S&P.
Historically this is less than the 27 percent premium of the past
several years. We provide comments on our perception of several catalysts
that may drive the drug index through the end of this year.
*The first catalyst may come next week. Lilly's Xigris for sepsis will be
before the FDA on September 12. We anticipate approval
and a subsequent Q4 launch.
*Bristol Myers will highlight data on their new hypertensive drug Vanlev
later this month or early next. Five key analyst/investor
meetings will transpire between October and December for LLY, BMY, PHA, MRK,
and PFE. SGP will host an ADAM meeting in
October.
*With a weaker dollar, Q4 looks strong for revenue acceleration as the S&P
earnings are being pressured.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*IDEC's Zevalin will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel on September 11.
*We think the main areas of focus for the panel will be 1) efficacy, with
emphasis on the stage of disease at which the product should
be used, 2) safety concerns, particularly with regard to hematological
toxicity, and 3) the dosing techniques used to administer the
drug.
*We think the chances of a positive outcome at the panel meeting are 75% or
greater. We forecast Zevalin launch early in 2002 and
revenues of $70 million in the first year.

Semiconductor Capital Equipment E. White, .212.526.4744
3Q EPS Preview -To Preannounce or Not To?
*Chipmakers continue to trim capital spending budgets resulting in weak 3Q
earnings for semiconductor equipment companies. We
think 3Q orders will be lower than 2Q and expect EPS guidance to be revised
lower for selected companies. This could limit near-term
upside potential in equipment shares.
*Many companies could face an uphill battle to meet 3Q expectations. Those
whose earnings may be more at risk than others include
ACLS, ASYT, CYMI, EGLS, FSII, LRCX, LTXX, PRIA, PHTN, TER, TWAV and VSEA.
*In summary, we see a high likelihood of multiple earnings preannouncements
over the coming weeks. We also believe that many of
the companies mentioned above could set lower expectations in 4Q than
consensus estimates currently reflect.

FY: 12/31 Price Target N/A $41
Rank N 3
*We are initiating coverage of Ameren with a 3-Market Perform rating. While
the Missouri rate case overhang could last into next
year, AEE's 6.12% yield should hold price firm.
*In addition to a good yield, other AEE positives are: 1) A track record for
delivering on earnings promises; 2) A well-run utility; and
3) Attractive geography for competing in unregulated energy markets.
*Our $3.30 2002 EPS estimate incorporates a ""middle of the road"" Missouri
rate case outcome in early Spring. We assume a $130M
P-T rate cut (-$0.46/share) and an 11% ROE.
*AEE's Illinois/Missouri location favorably positions it with nearly 25
adjacent utility trading partners.
*Our $41 target is 12.5x our 2002E. AEE's above-average yield (6.1% vs. 4.1%
for utilities and 1.4% for the S%P 500) and good
operations should provide support despite rate case overhang.

Mkt Cap: $2.2B EPS 2003 N/A $2.09E $2.31E 16.9
FY: 6/30 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank N 3
*Recognized as one of the oldest, dedicated pure-plays in power semis, IRF
is capitalizing on the emerging growth opportunities in
power mgnt which should lead to above average growth once the semiconductor
industry recovers.
*Dataquest estimates that 70% of the world's power MOSFETs are produced by
IRF or use its patented technology. The leadership
position in power components provides IRF with a platform to leverage
expansion into high margin power systems businesses.
*At 2.2x LTM P/S, we believe IRF represents a compelling valuation relative
to its peers given opportunity for margin expansion.
However, we are cautious near-term given lack of evidence into a sustained
recover in the broader semiconductor market.
*We initiate coverage on IRF with a 3-MP rating on a leader in power
semiconductors.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Mortgage Finance B. Harting, .212.526.3007
Historical Performance Indicates Futher Upside
*We have gone back in time, relating historic stock performance of our
sector following an easing cycle, defined as three consecutive
rate decreases. Historically, the group has continued to show strong
performance after the last rate cut into a period of rate increases.
The result has been an outperformance of the S&P 500 coming out of three of
the last four interest rate cuts.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $65 $65
Rank 1 1
*The LEH economic opinion is that the real estate market is not just a
bubble waiting to burst, and much of the doom and gloom in the
market may be overblown. Based on this opinion, we believe that a company
such as WFC may have upside potential when the
unfounded fears in the market are lifted. We continue to rate WFC 1 - Strong
Buy.
*To the extent that this view is correct, WFC should benefit from stronger
revenue growth in the mortgage and home equity
businesses. This should help to offset businesses that may have weaker
growth.
*The company should also be positioned to positively benefit from the
cross-sell opportunities which come with mortgage and home
equity sales.
*WFC may be a good valuation play as the stock currently may have the
market's negative predictions for the real estate market built
in.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $30 $30
Rank 2 2
*While we do not believe given the low weighting of residential exposure
that credit quality in this area should be a primary concern
among investors, we believe on balance it is reason for continued caution.
*Given the low concentration of residential lending exposure at GBBK, just
6% of the portfolio, this is not our area of primary
concern.
*Our concern is focused on the 47% concentration of commercial real estate
and construction loans in the portfolio which we believe
may be under greater pressure in the intermediate term.
*Most recently we highlighted credit trends at GBBK in a note dated 8/14
entitled ""More Real Estate Data, More Caution.""

 The key themes this year will be:

 -   the Internet stock crash and current economic slowdown

 -   how the economy of established companies and the new order of dot-coms are
 merging
 -   how companies can formulate winning strategies by combining the Internet
 with traditional competitive advantages

 catch-up with the US
 -   how investments in Internet infrastructures and eCommerce will drive a
 major economic development worldwide over the next decade

The Paradox of our time
  By George Carlin

  The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings
but shorter tempers; wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We spend
more, but have less; we buy more but enjoy less.

  We have bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but
less time; we have more degrees, but less sense; more knowledge, but
less judgment; more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less
wellness.

  We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom.

  We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk
too much, love too seldom, and hate too often. We've learned how to make
a living, but not a life, we've added years to life, not life to years.

  We've been all the way to the moon and back, but have trouble crossing
the street to meet a new neighbor. We conquered outer space but not
inner space.   We've done larger things, but not better things.

  We've cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul. We've conquered the
atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We plan
more, but accomplish less. We've learned to rush, but not to wait.

  We build more computers to hold more information to produce more
copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.

  These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; big men and
small character; steep profits and shallow relationships.

  These are the days of two incomes, but more divorce, fancier houses,
but broken homes.

  These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway morality,
one-night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do everything from
cheer, to quiet, to kill.

  It is a time when there is much in the show window and nothing in the
stockroom. A time when technology can bring this letter to you, and a
time when you can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit
delete.

  Remember; spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not
going to be around forever.

  Remember, say a kind word to someone who looks up to you in awe,
because that little person soon will grow up and leave your side.

  Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to you, because that is
the only treasure you  can give with your heart and it doesn't cost a
cent.

  Remember, to say ""I Love You"" to your partner and your loved ones, but
most of all, mean it.
  A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when it comes from deep inside of
you.

Remember to hold hands and cherish the moment for someday that person
will not be there again. Give time to love, give time to speak, give
time to share the precious thoughts in your mind.

  To my family, and all my friends in my life, thanks for being there!
George Carlin

in this missive but he once told me the MAIN reason (beside those

Hello Jeff,

Regardless of the present state of Wall Street and the rest of the US
economy, the choke point in business growth today is-and will continue to
be--talent rather than capital.

Hawkes-Peers & Co. is an executive search firm based in NYC. What
characterizes our candidates is their current and recent experiences. We
specialize in identifying opportunities for top-tier consultants from the
premier strategy firms--McKinsey, Bain, BCG, AT Kearney, and Booz Allen--who
have either rolled out into industry or are looking to move into the
corporate sector. These candidates also share the qualification of an MBA
from one of the elite business schools: Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, Stanford,
or Kellogg.

We target this group of individuals on an ongoing basis, maintaining an
active dialogue with them, so we know exactly whom to identify for
appropriate opportunities. Our network allows your organization to be highly
selective while saving invaluable time. You pick and choose among the most
talented strategic, operations, and management consulting professionals;
they build the future strength of your company.

If you have an interest in the pool of talent we represent, I would be happy
to provide you with more information. I can also send samples of our past
introductions as well as resumes provided with the candidates' permission.
Please let us know if there's any way we can help you.

Jeff,

Thanks for a great speech at the Barcelona Directors' Conference last Fall.
It was most inspiring and insightful.

I am returning to you with another request, which you, unfortunately, had
to turn down last year because of a Board meeting scheduling conflict but
that I hope you can make this time. We would very much like you to
participate in the Sanderst?len Conference in Norway, February 6-9, 2002,
as keynote speaker. While you are invited to stay for the entire conference
(your spouse is also invited), the preferred speaker dates are Wednesday,
February 6 or Thursday, February 7.

Among other confirmed speakers are Phil B. Watts (Shell), J.J. Mulva
(Phillips), Thierry Desmarest (TotalFinaElf), Burckhard Bergman (Ruhrgas),
Euan Baird (Schlumberger), Olav Akselsen (Norwegian Energy Minister). The
audience will consist mostly of top business executives in the
international energy industry. Participants are limited to 110 to preserve
the extraordinary atmosphere that characterizes the Conference.

Should you be willing to come, I would also suggest that you set aside some
time so I could arrange a couple of meetings with key energy executives in
the Nordic area. Olav Fjell, Statoil's CEO, would be eager to see you to
compare notes on opportunities in the European gas markets. As you know,
the company is being part-privatized as of June 18, and they will be
looking for cooperative arrangements. Also, several power-focussed
companies, such as V?ttenfall, Fortum and Statkraft would like to have
discussions with you. Most of the people mentioned above, will be at the
Conference.

I hope you are able to take this opportunity of combining speaking,
one-on-one discussions with a few top leaders at the same time as enjoying
a bit of Norwegian nature (you can go skiing at Sanderst?len!).

Best regards

Tore

"The Morning Market Call - Friday June 8th, 2001."," <<MF June 8th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The following are highlights from Lehman Brothers economists Stephen D.
Slifer and Ethan S. Harris's weekly comments:

""The dichotomy between the near-term and medium-term economic outlook
continues to build. Recent data for capital goods spending and the job
market point to a further deepening of the growth recession. At the same
time, the forces for eventual recovery continue to gather: major tax rebates
are now a done deal, the Fed continues to ease aggressively, the stock
market has begun to recover, and consumer confidence has begun to turn
upward. We remain confident that the economy will recover sharply during the
second half and return to solid trend growth in 2002. However, given the
considerable downward momentum in the economy, the recovery may not be soon
enough to deliver the solid 3% GDP growth we are forecasting in 3Q. Our
current forecast has just one more 25 bp rate cut from the Fed. However, the
odds are growing that the Fed will need to implement a 50 bp cut or two 25
bp cuts.""


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.72%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.33%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.87%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.04 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.87 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or

developments, including a continued decline in refinance activity
and the closing of the Fleet Mortgage acquisition.
*On June 1st, the company closed its acquisition of Fleet Mortgage. The
transaction has propelled WaMu to the #1 rank in mortgage
servicing and #2 rank in loan originations, based on 2000 volumes.
*Despite a small uptick last week, refinance activity continues to decline.
We believe that ARM lenders like WaMu have weathered
the boom well, and are positioned for additional balance sheet growing
forward.
*The lag effect on ARMs pegged to the COFI index will continue to drive
margin expansion for the next several quarters, as asset
yields remain at high levels.
*We expect significant mortgage banking gains when the company reports 2Q01
results, as the company has been selling 30 year fixed
product.

Rank 1 1
*Following its May 23 FY4Q01 conference call, we reduced our FY02
expectations and our price target to a more conservative $47.
We are now raising our target to $52 a figure more in-line with the average
historical (forward twelve-month) S&P premium of 50%
(range: 30-80%). Further analysis suggests that a rebound in the rate of ICD
market growth remains highly plausible by the 1Q02 .
Minimed acquisition adds another sustainable growth platform to cardiac
rhythm management and neuro/spinal and increases the
attainability of 15% sales growth. Other blockbuster opportunities warrant a
higher premium than implied in our existing price target.
*Longer-term growth prospects for ICDs becoming less of a concern.
*Acquisition of Minimed strategically meshes with Medtronic and will help to
ensure 15%+ near-term sales growth. Diabetes is
oftentimes a precedent for heart disease.

DBS: Good Value Despite Decelerating Growth
*We believe the DBS space as a whole is presently undervalued despite
decelerating growth. Consistent with that view, we have
initiated coverage on Hughes Electronics (GMH) with a 1-Strong Buy, EchoStar
(DISH) with a 2-Buy and Pegasus (PGTV) with a 2-Buy.
*We see a marketplace that still affords considerable room for growth. That
said, near-term growth is likely weak and a risk. Only
Hughes has yet to acknowledge 2Q01 growth issues, a risk. Long-term, the
future is still bright in spite of cable upgrades as satellites
offer a very compelling pay television product.
*Pending consolidation could make for good timing. While we are hopeful that
clarity alone could serve as a catalyst, we believe the
DBS sector will fundamentally benefit from either a Hughes-EchoStar or
Hughes-Sky Global pairing.

*Initiating coverage of Sirius Satellite Radio with a 1-Strong Buy rating
and a $57 mid-year 2002 target.
*The opportunity is difficult to match. Satellite radio benefits from both a
sizable addressable market, consisting of approximately 180
million vehicles and 100 million households, and an efficient, low-cost
satellite broadcast network.
*We look positively on the industry's transition to consumer reality from
concept. We believe the transition could help a skeptical
market become believers.
*Only a few steps left. In a relatively short period of time, Sirius has
successfully deployed its satellite network, cemented
programming relationships, forged strategic relationships with automakers as
well as inked distribution alliances with retailers. The
most important item still outstanding is finalizing its receiver chipset and
building production radios. We believe the company is
sufficiently on track with both its discrete and ASIC designs that at least
one of the two will be ready by December.

*We rate XM Satellite Radio 1-Strong Buy with a year-end 2001 price target
of $40, representing significant appreciation potential
from current levels. XM is one of two FCC licensed providers of satellite
radio, slated to begin offering service at the end of this
summer. The company will provide 100 stations of CD-quality music and talk
with coast-to-coast coverage for a monthly
subscription fee of $10. We feel that strong demand exists for the service
and are excited about its prospects.
*A late summer or early fall service start gets XM to market first, ahead of
competitor Sirius by several months, and a national
advertising campaign, budgeted at $110 million for the first twelve months,
should kick start the service launch nicely, not to mention
drum up additional investor interest.
*XM's strong economic model throws off normalized EBITDA margins of 52.7% in
the out years, demonstrating the leverage possible
under the satellite broadcast model.

acquisition to evidence intrinsic value in Hughes, we believe a positive
resolution to the matter could serve as a share catalyst if it
provides the clarity and closure that the market seems to now desire.
*We are concerned about weak 2Q growth due to the economy and slow rural
take-up. Our forecast of 275k 2Q01 net adds (vs. 275k-350k
guidance) and our 1.3mn 2001 net adds is well below guidance of 1.5mn to
1.7mn net adds. Therefore, near-term growth is still
a concern and risk.
*We believe Hughes is undervalued and a quality asset in the satellite

*Operationally, the company is executing well on all cylinders. EchoStar is
taking market share from DIRECTV, acquiring
incrementally more valuable subs while building monthly ARPU and controlling
churn. It's not surprising with such operational
discipline that EchoStar has evolved into an investor favorite.
*Although a sector issue, we are a little concerned that 2Q01 growth and
quite possibly 3Q01 growth might fall well below 1Q levels.
The risk is perhaps least meaningful to EchoStar since management already
voiced concerns about the quarter. Big picture, EchoStar
is still going to produce the best growth in the sector, in our view.

*We are initiating coverage of Gilat with a 2-Buy rating and $16.50 price

seems able to rebuild its core VSAT earnings engine back to near historical

*We are going to dare to say that we have already hit bottom. In the last
six to nine months, Gilats operating stability and the
confidence investors once placed in the company have eroded. We believe in
successive quarters, starting with 2Q02, Gilat will be
able to increasingly demonstrate that its business is in fact profitable and
stable.
*Long-term, we find it hard to imagine how Gilat cannot play a meaningful
role in the evolution of satellite broadband, since it
effectively created the enterprise and consumer equipment technology, along
with Hughes, that makes it all possible.
*We are concerned about StarBand's ability to build traction. However, at
the present Gilat price level, faith in StarBand is not a
requirement for purchase.

*Easing liquidity concerns is an important near-term step. Management plans
to divest between $100 million and $200 million in non-core
assets to lighten the load. Although there are risks, like ChinaSat-8, our
model indicates that Loral should be able to successfully
manage through a tight 2001.
*Sector consolidation could make FSS assets like Loral's more scarce. Loral

associated with DIRECTV is required for our target to be realized. The
present lack of clarity surrounding the issue restrains us from
more aggressively recommending Pegasus shares in spite of the seeming
potential.
*Historically, Pegasus has outpaced its peers because of satellite TV's
strength in rural markets. However, a relatively more mature
rural market and a weaker economic model, relative to Hughes and EchoStar,
have caused the company to recently switch its focus to
preserving its bottom line in lieu of growth.
*New DirecPC-based broadband model should be a near-term plus.
*Survivability disagreement with DIRECTV could go to trial in early 2002. If
Hughes is bought, we believe the new owner could
delay the trial to negotiate, leading possibly to a more favorable stance.

relative to the industry, is far from absent, and comes in
the form of both new satellite launches, which include PAS-10 and Galaxy
IIIC in 2001, and increasing utilization rates aboard the
existing satellite fleet. PAS-10 was launched in 2Q01 and Galaxy IIIC will

*ViaSat has become a primary supplier to a number of leading satellite
broadband projects, ensuring the company's prominent role in
the development of a mass market, last-mile satellite broadband solution.
*Hughes and Gilat have been tied to their own broadband endeavors, leaving
ViaSat to sign-up everyone else.
*The company's in-house engineering talent appears to be paying off in a
significant way. We believe a large potential defense
contract award could come as early as calendar 3Q01, potentially serving as
an important share catalyst if we are right.

*Handspring preannounced Q4 (June) revenues would be down 50% q/q versus
their prior forecast of up 5%. This was much worse
than we had expected when we lowered our revenue estimates down 10% on May
17th.
*There were three factors contributing to the large shortfall in revenue.
First, the general economic slowdown in the US has caused
channel sell through growth of handheld computing devices to drop from 100+%
y/y in January to 12% y/y growth in April and May.
Second, Palm's pricing actions and new product introductions had a negative
impact on Handspring sales during the quarter. Third,
retail channel inventory levels for Handspring have increased from the low
end of the 8-12 week recommended range to 12 weeks for
all devices.

*Yesterday, BMY entered into a definitive agreement with DuPont to buy their
pharmaceutical business for $7.8 billion in cash.
*This acquisition appears expensive to us at this price. According to
guidance, the deal is dilutive for BMY in 2002 and accretive in
2003 and beyond. It is particularly expensive considering the deal does not
include the crown jewel of DuPont's portfolio, namely the
hypertension agents Cozaar/Hyzaar.
*Moreover, this move does nothing to address potential near term revenue
pressures for BMY. Generic entry of Glucophage is
imminent and the switch strategy has been less than stellar.
*There is a reasonable fit with the respective product franchises (HIV,
cardiovascular). Thus, we believe a small sales synergy may be
gained. Plus, we feel a cost synergy can be realized, beginning in 2002 and
peaking in 2003.
*Based on a lack of near term revenue inflexions, we maintain our 2 BUY

"Re:	Your invitation to cover Rome Peace Conference","	You would not be a successful journalist if you had always played it safe and
gone along with conventional thinking.  Being able to think ""outside the box""
is the mark of an open-minded person, who can see the truth in an unexpected
way.  Being open to the unexpected is essential to good investigative journalism.

	What is the single greatest political story in the world today?  Clearly it
is the worldwide escalation of violence and bloodshed, especially in the Middle
East.  According to the latest annual report of the Red Cross, there are more
armed conflicts raging around the world now than at any time since World War
II.

	Is there a different ""angle"" to the story of a world full of bloody conflict?
 Yes, there is. It has nothing to do with covering yet another conference of
world leaders or yet another round of failed Arab-Israeli negotiations.  This
""angle"" would require a journalist to think ""outside the box"" in a very big way,
for the perspective we are talking about is not the world's perspective, but
Heaven's perspective.

	Suspend your natural skepticism for a moment and consider this: On October 13,
1917, some 70,000 people gathered in a muddy field in Fatima, Portugal, to witness
what three little children said would be a miracle at noon that day. Precisely
at the moment predicted, the huge crowd saw the sun spin in the sky, throw off
unimaginable colors and then plunge toward the earth, only to return to its normal
position in the sky.  The muddy field became bone dry in an instant, as did the
rain-soaked crowd. Secular newspapers, including the New York Times, reported
the event.  Warner Brothers later made a movie based upon it.  Everyone in that
crowd-believers and non-believers alike-experienced the Miracle of the Sun that
day.  There is no precedent in world history for a public miracle whose occurrence
was precisely predicted three months in advance.

	What was the point of the Miracle of the Sun?  It was a sign given to authenticate
what the three children had been told by the Blessed Virgin Mary in a series
of earlier apparitions in that very same field.  The children asked the Virgin
to provide a Miracle so the people would believe what She had told them.

	And what the Virgin told them was this: God will grant peace to the world when
Russia is solemnly and publicly Consecrated to the Virgin Mary by the Pope, together
with all the Catholic bishops of the world.  But the Virgin also warned that
if the Consecration is not done, Russia would spread its errors throughout the
world, there would be wars and persecutions, and that, ultimately, ""various nations
will be annihilated.""

	Weeks before the Russian revolution of 1917, the Virgin of Fatima accurately
predicted the end of World War I, the emergence of world communism, the election
of Pope Pius XI, the beginning of World War II and worldwide persecution of the
Catholic Church by communist regimes, which continues today. So far, the accuracy
of the Fatima predictions is 100%.

	No wonder Pope John Paul II has personally attested to the authenticity of the
Message of Fatima.  Indeed, the Pope escaped death at the hands of an assassin
on the very anniversary of the first Fatima apparition. Even Newsweek magazine,
in a cover story on the Virgin Mary, recognized the relation of the Fatima events
to the collapse of communism in Russia.  Yet, for various reasons, the Consecration
of Russia called for by the Virgin at Fatima remains undone, and the collapse
of communism has not brought peace to the world. Given the utter accuracy of
the Virgin's predictions, can the world simply ignore Her warning about the annihilation
of nations?

	Conventional thinkers may scoff at such things as miracles and apparitions of
the Virgin Mary. But today, the cause of world peace requires the setting aside
of such prejudices.  It requires the courage to admit that man must look to a
power greater than himself and to a source beyond the limitations of earthly
reality.

	This is your invitation to attend and cover an important conference on the Message
of Fatima and its utmost relevance to the quest for world peace, now more urgent
than ever before. From October 7th to 13th, 2001, at the Catholic University
of the Sacred Heart in Rome, dignitaries and speakers from around the world will
consider how Heaven's plan for peace can be accomplished now, while there is
yet time.

We are now mailing out conference information packages and written invitations.
Contact Coralie Graham, Editor of The Fatima Crusader, at  or call +1-905-871-7607
or fax +1-905-	871-2165:

"Request","
Hi Jeff, 
I am a consultant working with Conoco (Downstream North America and Europe) - helping them reinvent their business through innovation. My clients are Jim Nokes, EVP and Rick Hamm in Europe. I would like to discuss with you the possibility of you speaking to a group of senior executives at Conoco UK, telling the Enron 'story' and how you've reinvented your business. Your presence would be a very inspiring to them and telling the story 'live' would help them develop the mindset they need to innovate new products, services and get into new markets.
I will give you a call tomorrow (Tuesday) to follow up on your level of interest or I can be reached on my mobile at +1.617.306.0599
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Carl Kaestner

"[smu-betas] Dent pisses on Bud Wilkinson's grave","Dear Brothers,
It was good to see everyone make the trek to central Oklahoma to launch
Dent's book.  The Daily Oklahoman published a brief story that suggested Dent
had made up a bunch of lies about Saint Bud Wilkinson steppin out on the old
lady.  Around here, that's like saying the Pope likes it up the ass.
Needless to say, the Sooner faithful were slightly chapped and the university
canceled their offer to host the signing party at our new museum.  Fuck 'em.
Who wants to drink beer in a dusty old museum anyway?
     Del, sorry I couldn't make the party but I did get to see Cdie, Grumbles
, Strange, Woody, Benson, PP, and Space for dinner.  My favorite part was the
full-volume discussion of who had the biggest penis (next to Benson, of
course).  Typical urology shit.  The family next to us failed to recognize a
medical discussion amongst professionals.  Speaking of Benson, he was worried
that his erections might crater all of a sudden just like his near vision has
recently done.  I assured him that this was extremely unlikely but, in his
case, he'd better hope that his cardiac output remains high or else he's
liable to pass out every time he gets a hard on.

                                                                     B. Miller

"FW: Seach","Jeff,

This sort narrowed the search considerably.  I'm having hard copies that I've organized by city (makes it quicker to look at) hand carried to you.  The 1959 info should be coming in a couple of days.  If this approach doesn't find the person, I have another idea.

Thanks,
Billy

Billy,

I have asked 1959 to be added to the search.  Should have it in a day or
two.

"Endorsing the Rappaport/Mauboussin book","Jeff,

I hope all is well with you.

Sorry I missed you in NY a couple of weeks ago. I'd love to catch up with
you. Looks and sounds like you are still doing terrific things, and I use
you and Enron a great deal in conveying my message to investors and
managers.

Al Rappaport and I have completed our book, Expectations Investing, which
will be published by Harvard Business School Press in September. (See
attached preface). I'm really excited about the product, and I think you'll
find it interesting as well.

Al and I have asked the publisher to send you a more recent version for your
review. You'll probably get it in the next week or so.

Specifically, we'd be honored if you would endorse our book. The endorsers
we are targeting are a blue chip group, and we feel your perspective would
add a great deal.

Thanks in advance, and feel free to give me a shout if you have any
questions.

Michael

"Harvard-Yale Game","Attached is an invitation for the Harvard-Yale Game.  This year, we are
doing a few things differently, and we really hope you can join us:

  - Children's activities and free kid's admission!
  - Reduced pricing for recent graduates!
  - A flag football game challenge from the Yale Club (message attached)

It should be a very fun afternoon.  Come and join the fun!

  **********************************
A Message from the Yale Club to the Harvard Club:

We are throwing down the white hankerchief to challenge the Harvard Club's
mettle.  Following the broadcast of The Game, the local Harvard alums can
redeem their football team's performance during a flag football game to be
played on the grounds of The Bayou Club -- henceforth to be known as The
Flag Game.

Cheerleaders are encouraged.  Rules of engagement will be clarified at the
game.  A capella singing groups will be rewarded.  MIT is, as always,
unwelcome.

We would like to initiate this as an annual grudge match of the highest
level of civility, comraderie and fun.  A trophy and individual
certificates of merit will be awarded along with bragging rights for the
ensuing year.

Hopefully this will stimulate participation amongst your younger ""Johns""
""Crimson"" (whatever Harvard people call themselves!).  We will even create
a digital trophy to place on our, uh, the winning team's Web site.

We tried to set this up for the morning of The Game, but alas the club is
not keen on us using their showers.  So, afterward it shall be - so people
can go home and take showers.

Likewise, while we expect some people (as always) to arrive in coat &
tie...this year we expect and encourage more people to arrive as most
Harvard types do...in jeans or some other appropriate sporting attire :o) ..

Lets get more Harvardians, Cantabs, Crimson, Johns, whatever out this
year.  At least 50!

Boola boola!

I was actually on the phone with my Dad when I received Kenneth Lay's email about your departure, we both wish you luck and hope that everything is ok.  I have been working here as a consultant for the past month or two and have to say that I really enjoy the Enron environment, culture, and company that you helped build.  It really is an incredible place.

Regardless, I currently live in Austin and work here during the weeks.  If you ever get a chance, I'd love to hear from you sometime.  You can always email me here or my other address (wcarberry@sensecorp.com) or call me at 512-791-4709.

My Mom, Dad and I have always admired your successes and I still remember when we went tubing right after you decided to leave a sure thing at McKinsey to take a chance at this new merger-created company called Enron - what an amazing ride.  We do wish you well going forward.

Sincerely,

By the way, Dent is not the only author in our  ranks. Written under the pen name, SmackNabb, I have a Beta big brother who is  going throughout Texas hawking his new book, ""The Complete Infidel's Guide to  Radical Islam"".

    At the risk of him saying ""It's no big deal fellas"", I need to notify
you that Brother John Grumbles, will be undergoing exploratory heart surgery
via the ole catheter up the leg procedure sometime very soon.  The Drs. are
telling him he's most likely got a partially clogged artery at the bottom of
his heart and if he does, they will proceed with the angioplasty procedure
at the same time.  Dr. Fullerton has already contacted him as have several
of us local guys and I think IT IS A BIG DEAL and I know he would appreciate
a call.  The surgery was actually scheduled for a couple of days ago but was
cancelled at the last minute because of a doctor screw up.
     His phone number is 972 617-2412.  Nothing like a big dose of -kai-when

Yes, Elvis is still  alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are  the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the  class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated  the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people  than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1  year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on  Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At  Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay  connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's  incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it  up right where they left off years ago.

Jeff, 
Knowing that ENE is making market in the paper industry I thought it would be  
of interest to you to possibly work a deal with DOMTAR (DTC) who just  
announced earnings were cut in half due to energy costs.  Sounds like an  
opportunity there.

"The Morning Market Call - Monday June 4th, 2001."," <<MF June 4th 2001>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Lehman Brothers' U.S. Equity Strategist, Jeff Applegate, believes that the
stock market is ""climbing a wall of worry"". In his weekly comments, Jeff
believes that investors are jittery about the fragility of the stock market
rally, concerned about corporate profits and the economic outlook as well as
possible inflation. However, Jeff believes that the earnings trough is
imminent and that stronger GDP growth lies ahead. His bottom line is that
the equity rally over the last couple of months has a ""firm footing"" and
should continue.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.67%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.32
The 5-year is trading at 4.89%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.25 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.06 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Gillette Co(G) 3 - Market Perform A. Lefever, .212.526.5801
Choppy Waters Before the Calm
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.75 EPS 2000 N/A $1.18 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $37 - 25 EPS 2001 $1.01E $1.01E $1.06E 28.5
Mkt Cap: $30.4B EPS 2002 $1.11E $1.11E $1.19E 25.9
FY: 12/31 Price Target $24 $24
Rank 3 3
*While we expect Kilts' June 6 presentation to offer revolutionary insights
about longer-term upside at Gillette, the nearer-term
message is likely to be more pain on the horizon first.
*The best long-term opportunity at Gillette is fixing largely self-inflicted
problems to enable its premium portfolio to drive stronger
earnings growth.
*Nearer-term, at least for the duration of CY2001, we expect Gillette's
resources to be more focused on correcting earnings growth
obstacles such as excess trade spend and trade inventories, poor internal
information reporting, excess capital levels, and weak returns
on investment.
*The stock is currently trading at levels which suggest earnings recovery
already priced-in. We would be more constructive on the
stock at a market multiple, implying a $24 price on our below consensus CY01
earnings estimate.

Specialty Pharmaceuticals R. Silver, .212.526.5387
Strong Generic Stock Moves; What's Sustainable
*Generic drug stocks have outperformed strongly during the last month and
week, driven primarily by a large concentration of positive
company-specific news further fueled by an element of momentum style
investing. With overall valuations still off the highs of
2000, we believe that current levels can be sustained though significant
multiple expansion is unlikely. Based on last week's sharp
run-up, a near-term breather is warranted. However, we believe that further
near-term/medium term outperformance remains
possible for a select few names based on likely pending newsflow and/or
valuation ""catch-up"".
*Ivax remains attractive trading idea based on likelihood of EPS surprises
and upward revisions; Watson the best value name with
valuation catch-up likely over the next year.

Allstate Corp(ALL) 1 - Strong Buy J. Newsome, .212.526.6019
Big Boys are Raising Prices (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $43.10 EPS 2000 N/A $2.72 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $46 - 22 EPS 2001 $3.04E $3.15E $3.07E 13.7
Mkt Cap: $31.5B EPS 2002 $3.45E $3.45E $3.46E 12.5
FY: 12/31 Price Target $50 $50
Rank 1 1
*We are reiterating our 1-Strong Buy on Allstate. In the past week the stock
has suffered a minor decline for no apparent reason, and
we feel it would be a good time to revisit the stock. Indeed, our thesis
that personal lines prices would continue to improve in 2001
and 2002 seems to be coming true. The big insurers including State Farm are
raising rates. In our view Allstate remains the best-poised
insurer to benefit from a less competitive personal lines market. Unlike its
competitors, Allstate did not participate as much in
the fierce price wars of the late 1990s. It therefore remained profitable on
an underwriting basis where almost all did not. And in the
subsequently is better prepared to take advantage as most other insurers
struggle to regain profitability mostly likely through a
combination of maintaining their excellent underwriting profitability and
gaining market share. Our price target remains$50 per
share.

Fifth Third Bancorp(FITB) 1 - Strong Buy H. Dickson, .212.526.5659
Modeled for 15%+ EPS growth (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $58.87 EPS 2000 N/A $1.88 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $61 - 40 EPS 2001 $2.40E $2.40E $2.38E 24.5
Mkt Cap: $28.4B EPS 2002 $2.75E $2.75E $2.76E 21.4
FY: 12/31 Price Target $70 $75
Rank 1 1
*Our recent management visit in Cincinnati focused on FITB's business model,
its business lines and the Old Kent merger. Bottom
line, things are going well. The success of the company is tied in part to
its unique and extremely focused business model which has
yielded 15%+ EPS growth. We continue to rate FITB 1 - Strong Buy and are
raising our price target $5 to $75.
*Decentralization is a major aspect of FITB's business model and ownership
incentives are offered at all levels of the company.
Accountability and performance measurement are also central to the model.
*The Old Kent integration appears to be going smoothly. FITB began this
initiative in December, about four months before the deal
closed. Fifth Third believes that the Chicago market should be a good source
of growth in the future.
*The recently filed 8-K indicates revenue growth should remain strong this
year and asset quality trends should remain superior to the
industry.

FOCUS STOCKS
Universal Health Services(UHS) 1 - Strong Buy A. Feinstein, .212.526.5496
Universal Health Services:
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $39 EPS 2000 N/A $1.58 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $56 - 27 EPS 2001 $1.91E $1.91E $1.91E 20.4
Mkt Cap: $2.6B EPS 2002 $2.22E $2.22E $2.22E 17.6
FY: 12/31 Price Target $115 $57
Rank 1 1
*Highlights of Lehman Sponsored UHS Behavioral Health Site Visit Confirm
Upbeat Outlook.
*Based on our interaction with the company we suggest 1) continued rev
momentum in both acute care and behavioral health, 2)
behavioral health will continue to exceed expectations, 3) margins are
beginning to improve.
*The company suggested that it will still recognize several million dollars
of incremental synergies at the Charter facilities and feels
that it can expand the top line with addition of services and from new payer
contracts.
*We are raising our estimate for the second quarter to $0.48 from $0.47
(split adjusted for the stock split effective as of today),
bringing our estimate for the year to $1.91 from $1.90. We continue to
suggest that the shares of UHS remain a compelling value at
current levels.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Semiconductors & Communications A. Chanda, .415.274.5370
Q2 weak with Q3 guidance cloudy
*We believe that the communications components companies are facing a
difficult Q2 with no signs of improvement near-term. We
would recommend the CPE players with strong product cycles (Intersil,
Marvell) and avoid the telecom sector except Agere on
valuation.

Du Pont(DD) 3 - Market Perform S. Vasnetsov, .212.526.3212
Is there a life after the death of life-sciences concept?
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $46.4 EPS 2000 N/A $2.73 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $51 - 38 EPS 2001 $2.10E $2.10E $2.04E 22.1
Mkt Cap: $48.5B EPS 2002 N/A N/A $2.58E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $45 $45
Rank 3 3
*After DD annual meeting on business and strategy update, it is still
questionable that the current strategy could produce long-term
EPS and ROCE targets, excluding an obvious ramp-up in 2002-03, from the
current trough of the economic cycle.
*Our cautious macro view on DD remains intact. DD underperformed most large
cyclicals over the past two years, and so far we see
no likely company-specific catalyst to change its near-term performance
and/or the gloomy attitude of investors towards DD.
*Portfolio issues: pharma business sale is delayed, but on track; DD is not
interested in Aventis agrochem. unit; and other than small
bolt-on acquisitions, no major changes are expected in the next 4 quarters.
*We are reducing our 2001 EPS estimates: 2Q from $0.55 to $0.50, and FY from
$2.10 to $1.95. The EPS cut is due to the impact of
Europe's economy slowing down, and we re-iterate our ""Market Perform""
rating.

"Team Captains Needed","Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

"Noble Systems Executive Update + Opportunities For You","Jeffrey,

ATOMS continues to establish itself to be the most effective and reliable predictive dialer in the world! Previous users of other predictive systems continue to report production improvements of typically 20% with ATOMS.  Please check out several new customer success stories, updates, press releases and feature enhancements at www.noblesys.com

Noble Systems is now initiating a new program where our friends like you can receive $1,000.00 plus for each new customer that you refer to me. These referral commissions are applicable on only new leads going forward. You must sign up for this program in advance and register the lead. If you wish to do so, please advise and I'll forward this sign-up information to you.

Also, in part because of the combined calling of Noble Systems users along with the 16,000 agents working for Teleperformance (our $700 million plus parent), we can now also secure for you a 2.5 cent per minute call rate on T1 traffic. And you need not even be a Noble Systems user to take advantage of this package. Please advise and I'll get this information to you.

Current hot items on our product side include extending our skills-based routing from inbound to answering outbound predictive traffic.

In addition to now providing fully automated credit card authorizations, our integrated IVR (Interactive Voice Response) can also do just about any application including automated surveys, automated appointment confirmations, etc.

And, most importantly, PerfectScript can now improve both agent productivity and agent retention more than any single innovation in the past several years. With PerfectScript, agents may pre-record portions of their presentations, rebuttals, mirandas etc. At their discretion, the appropriate pre-recorded voice segment plays in lieu of the agent responding; totally seamless and without clicks etc. so that the other party is not aware that the agent is not really speaking. At any time your agent may stop the recorded play by simply touching the keyboard space bar and continue in his/her own voice.

Another PerfectScript benefit is that the enthusiasm with which they record their rebuttals tends to be maintained throughout every conversation for optimal results.

And yet another very important benefit of PerfectScript is that agents may pre-record their initial call introduction: ""Hello, this is Dan. May I speak with"" at which point your agent then speaks the called party's name and continues on.

Jeffrey, have a great week and whenever I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to call or email me back.

"East Africa","
Jeff,
 
Mona Yousry and I are both sending you seperate messages regarding Mr. Larry Robinson.  I have known Larry for 30 years.  I spent 3 years in Tanzania with Larry and his father when I was 16 years old.  My father was the only M.D. at an 80 bed hospital 40 miles north of Kigoma, Tanzania.
 
Larry is assisting the Maasai tribes in Tanzania by installing solar powered water pumps.  Larry is looking for creative ways to fund the solar projects, which are obviously energy related.  Larry has access to various tribal art works that could be imported back to the states as well as offering unique safaris into areas of East Africa that are not on the map so to speak.  The trading of art or safaris for solar resources seems to some how fit a model that you are an expert in.  Namely trading.  
Based on what I have read about you, your interest in dangerous and thrilling adventures combined with your access to financial or energy related solutions and knowing Larry, a truly one of a kind human being, would you be willing to start a dialog with him?  
I asked Larry to write something about himself and life in Africa.  I am attaching it as is, for your review.  
 
Best Regards,
Jonathan
 
Lawrence Robinson: Born in Congo, Central Africa, 1952.  
My father was born in Zimbabwe, Africa. My parents and grandparents were Missionaries. My grandparents went to Africa from California in 1912 and are both buried in Africa. I was raised in very remote areas of the Belgian Congo and from an early age spent lots of time in the African Bush. This was a time to learn many of the secrets necessary to survive the African bush and love it. I had the opportunity to study and learn animal behavior in ways that most experts only dream about. Some of my greatest memories are from times I would take a pocket full of salt with my rifle and go into the bush for 10 days to 2 weeks at a time, sometimes totally alone. It was also a time to learn about the African people and their languages and cultures. As time passed and Independence swept the Continent, I saw Zaire, the great land where I was born, turn into a blood bath. I learned more about the most savage creature of! all. As I saw men slaughter men, women, and children, I understood better how organized and balanced nature really is. I am a U.S. Citizen and Resident in Tanzania, East Africa. I am tri-lingual and understand three other African languages. I have an FAA Commercial Pilots license. Educated in Cape Town, South Africa, Singapore, Beirut, Lebanon, Michigan, and California. Have two B.S. degrees. One in Agriculture and one in Industrial Education. Have traveled around the world many times. My longest overland trip was from Germany to Cape Town driving my own Toyota Land Cruiser. This was a 10 month journey of over 30,000 miles. Crossing the Sahara Desert and the Kalahari Desert before a GPS was available was indeed a great adventure. From 1985 to 1992 I owned and operated my own Import Export Company in Central Africa called ""Malaika Zaire"".  Presently I am Managing Director and Chairman of the Board of ""Solar Universal Network"" - a Californian Non-profit Organization, 501! (c)3. Solar Universal Network is also established in Tanzania as an International NGO since 1995. S.U.N.'s primary focus is to establish safe, permanent, water supplies for communities in Tanzania using alternative energy. An example of our work is at Sukenya, Northern Tanzania where we are pumping approximately 12,000 gallons of water per day from 250 feet deep for the Maasai Community using only Solar Energy. This system has been operating for a year now with outstanding success. When necessary, we also use UV Water Purification Units powered by Solar Energy to purify any contamination which may exist in water supplies.  One of the areas we are now working in is located in Northern Tanzania just South of the Kenya boarder and just East of the Serengeti National Park. This is considered Maasai Land and is fascinating country. Each year hundreds of thousands Wilderbeasts migrate south through this area to give birth to their young in the Southern plains of the Serengeti! . The great migration is considered one of natures last unmatched marvels on earth. This is the time when the predators like lions, leopards, cheetah, and hyena are roaming the area. There are also heards of Cape Buffalo, Elephant, and many types of antelope and zebra. Because of the Community Development that S.U.N. has done in this area, we have an exceptional opportunity to hike, camp, and hunt with the Maasai in this location. I have personally been within 10 yards of a lion and his kill while on foot with a Maasai warrior and only a spear in hand.  Tanzania is also the land of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Victoria, and Zanzibar Island.

It has come to my attention that either our YahooGroup is not working,
or you are not communicating.  So this message is a Search for
ExtraTerrestial Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this
august group. I will even count terrestial intelligence this time.

What with Homecoming only 5 days away, we figured there would be some

Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there is life

"The Morning Market Call - Friday September 7th, 2001."," <<MF September 7th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Friday Afternoon - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Today's employment number was not a good one - however, it should prompt the
Fed to be more aggressive. The unemployment rate was the worst part of the
report, jumping to 4.9%. The market had been looking for 4.7% unemployment.
The jump in the unemployment rate was bad, but we have to remember two
things. First, the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of economic
conditions. Second, with revisions, the payroll number  was only slightly
worse than consensus. That said, the drop in aggregate hours of  -0.4%  and
the confidence impact of the jump in the unemployment rate will likely
result in lower GDP growth in the 3rd and 4th quarters than we were
anticipating. Lehman Brothers' economists now look for third quarter GDP of
1.0% (previous. 2.0%) and fourth quarter growth of 2.0% (previous. 3.0%). In
addition they now expect the Federal Reserve to cut  50 basis points at the
October 2nd meeting and expect a further 25 bp cut at the November 6th
meeting. The unemployment rate is now at its highest level since September
1997. But remember: The unemployment rate is a lagging indicator of economic
conditions.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.38%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.79%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.28%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.92 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.48 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

AOL Time Warner(AOL) 2 - Buy H. Becker, .212.526.1764
AOL Update - Lowering 2002 Estimates (A)

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*In our view, AOL Time Warner remains THE premier integrated media company
with a uniquely valuable portfolio of assets. Its
core businesses offer investors superior earnings power and growth while its
new transformational initiatives should propel the
company's long-term growth rate to above industry norms. The stock remains
the most attractive long term holding in our universe.
*However, we continue to believe that near term performance of the stock
will be held back by the softness in the advertising market
and the resulting lack of earnings visibility. Current estimates are calling
for a significant acceleration in revenue growth (especially
advertising) in the second half of 2001.
*For 2002, we are officially lowering our estimates (which had not been
adjusted since early 2001) to more conservative levels. Our
revenue estimate is moving from $44.0 billion to $42.2 billion and EBITDA
from $13.2 billion to $12.4 billion.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*Generally credited with driving the early growth of the cable industry,
almost 30 years later, HBO continues to find new subscribers,
build viewership and increase cash flow at double-digit rates.
*As a premium service, HBO is not at the mercy of the ups and downs of the
advertising cycle, but rather enjoys an annuity-like
stream of (monthly)subscription revenues, providing a stabilizing influence
to the financial performance of the Networks group as a
whole.
*HBO is expected to generate significantly above trend cash flow results
this year due to fundamental strength in the business as well
as one-time benefits from cost-cutting and merger synergies.
*HBO enjoys tremendous operating leverage--margins are continually expanding
because of the per subscriber leverage on costs.
*Quality original programming, an unparalleled movie line-up and
multiplexing are the cornerstones of HBO's growth.

AOL Time Warner(AOL) 2 - Buy H. Becker, .212.526.1764

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*Cable is a bedrock of financial stability for AOL Time Warner. It
consistently generates mid-teens EBITDA growth and should
begin generating significant amounts of free cash flow by 2002.
*Cable creates incremental value through new services such as digital and
high-speed data, secures value for cable programming at
AOL networks and will serve as the platform for the next generation of
convergent services such as VOD, IP-based telephony,
interactive TV and home networking.
*For 2001, we are expecting revenue growth of 14% to $6.9 billion and EBITDA
growth of 15% to $3.3 billion. Over the next five
years, we anticipate TWC will maintain compound annual revenue growth of
12-13% and EBITDA growth of 15%.
*While Cable is one of the segments with the most short-term upside
potential due to very strong demand for broadband services, we
are concerned about the declining trend in basic subscriber growth and the
lack of studio support for VOD via cable.
Gaming & Lodging J. Minor, .617.342.4120
Near-Term Caution, Lowering Lodging Estimates & Targets
*Given weaker than expected July and August results, we are lowering our
2H01 lodging estimates. Our estimates conservatively
assume the current weakness continues throughout 3Q01 and 4Q01, as we've
heard no signs of strengthening. Further we now expect
a slower rebound, and have revised our 2002 RevPAR growth forecasts to 1%-2%
from 3%-4%. As a result, we have lowered our
2002 estimates by 5% to 10% or so, putting us below consensus by a similar
amount. We have lowered our price targets on our
lower estimates. While the stocks are already down 10% since the news of the
worse than expected weakness, we think near-term
caution is warranted as the group could remain choppy as estimates decline.
We continue to like the group for the demand recovery
scenario, we just see it as further out.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $95 $95
Rank 1 1
*We are reiterating our 1 Strong Buy rating on XL Capital at the beginning
of what we expect will be a pivotal month for reinsurance
prices. XL Capital is the only large-cap insurer with the lion's share of
its revenues generated by reinsurance and, therefore, purchase
of XL Capitals shares is the best way for large-cap investors to benefit
from rising reinsurance prices. During the week of September
10, the reinsurance world will convene at the annual Rendez-Vous de
Septembre in Monte Carlo, France. This is the event where
reinsurers, brokers, and reinsurance customers begin their discussions about
reinsurance prices for the important January 1, 2002
renewals. Since approximately 55% of all reinsurance is priced for January 1
effective dates, the pricing commentary that is
generated by this conference is key to the reinsurance industrys
profitability. Based on discussions with reinsurers and insurers we
expect the Monte Carlo conference will affirm that the reinsurance industry
will experience another year of price firming with prices
increases at least as much as last January, or at least 15%-20%.

*BMY are conducting several trials with their antihypertensive drug Vanlev.
OCTAVE is a trial in hypertension and has concluded.
Data should be available this month or next. OVERTURE is a trial in
congestive heart failure. It's conclusion is sometime next year.
*Cardiology contacts for whom we have spoken to yesterday indicate that BMY
are asking investigators of the OVERTURE trial to
""switch all patients over to Vanlev in January"". This implies that the
number of events in the trial is sufficient to potentially draw a
conclusion (end the trial) maybe in time for the Spring heart meetings (ACC
in March). Further, it may imply that BMY believe
Vanlev is safe enough to switch ALL patients over to the drug, and perhaps
(though only a postulate) the efficacy in a sufficient
population of patients is at least as good if not better than the placebo
ACE inhibitor lisinopril. Our peak sales remain $1.5 billion for
this drug as these comments increase in our minds the probability of success
of this drug in heart failure.

*As we previewed on Tuesday when we cut our EPS, INTC lowered guidance. Revs
guidance is now slightly below the mid-point of
the range ($6.2B-$6.8B) but below the midpoint on GMs of 47%. This was
despite July and August being better than they expected.
*Processors were better than expected in July and Aug. and PIV processors
have ramped well while flash and networking revs are
expected to be flattish with continuing declines in ASPs in all categories.
*Operating expenses are expected to be about $100M less than originally
expected but equity gains/interest income are expected to be
$90M worse. Intel also has a one-time benefit of $100M in tax provisions
which adds 1.5 cents to EPS for Q3.
*Intel noted that September is the most back-end loaded third month in any
quarter. At some point, Intels statements of July and
August being better than plan and the PC OEMs stating back to school is
below plan have to be reconciled.

*We are cutting our estimates for several semiconductor equipment companies

semiconductor capital spending.
*A number of chip companies, including Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing, and second tier chip manufacturer's, appear to

"[smu-betas] FW: Federal Bill 602p","

I am forwarding this message which I received yesterday for your review and
action. Imagine the chilling effect that a tax would have on the exchange
of nostalgia that has been taking place between the brethren.  Even if you
don't participate directly it has been a pleasure to watch.

My name is Starkey Sharp.  I graduated in 1974. I don't remember my number,
but I think it was around 504.

Federal Bill 602p

Guess the warnings were true. Federal Bill 602P 5-cents per E-mail sent.
It figures!  No more free E-mail!  We knew this was coming!! Bill 602P
will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent charge on every
delivered
E-mail.  Please read the following carefully if you intend to stay online
and continue using E-mail.  The last few months have revealed an alarming
trend
in the Government of the United States attempting to quietly push through
legislation that will affect our use of the Internet.

Under proposed legislation, the US Postal Service will be attempting to
bill E-mail users out of ""alternative postage fees.""

Bill 602P will permit the Federal Government to charge a 5-cent surcharge
on every e-mail delivered, by billing Internet Service Providers at source.
The consumer would then be billed in turn by the ISP.

Washington DC lawyer Richard Stepp is working without pay to prevent this
legislation from becoming law. The US Postal Service is claiming lost
revenue, due to the proliferation of E-mail, is costing nearly $230,000,000
in revenue per year. You may have noticed their recent ad campaign: ""There
is nothing like a letter.""

Since the average person received about 10 pieces of E-mail per day in
1998, the cost of the typical individual would be an additional 50 cents a
day --
or over $180 per year -- above and beyond their regular Internet costs.

Note that this would be money paid directly to the US Postal Service for a
service they do not even provide.

The whole point of the Internet is democracy and noninterference. You are
already paying an exorbitant price for snail mail because of bureaucratic
inefficiency.  It currently takes up to 6 days for a letter to be delivered
from coast to coast.  If the US Postal Service is allowed to tinker with
E-mail, it will mark the end of the ""free"" Internet in the United States.

Congressional representative, Tony Schnell (R) has even suggested a
""$20-$40 per month surcharge on all Internet service"" above and beyond the
governments proposed E-mail charges.  Note that most of the major
newspapers have ignored the story the only exception being the
Washingtonian which called the idea of E-mail surcharge ""a useful concept
who's time has come"" (March 6th, 1999 Editorial).  Do not sit by and watch
your freedom erode away!

Send this E-mail to EVERYONE on your list, and tell all your friends and
relatives to write their congressional representative and   say ""NO"" to
Bill 602P.

It will only take a few moments of your time and could very well be
instrumental in killing a bill we do not want.

PLEASE FORWARD!

"Globlalization issues","Hello Jeff, the purpose for this message is to bring attention to
my firm, SDL International.   Big admirer of what Enron and you
 have done in the broadband sector and would like to prove the
value of my firm to Enron.   SDL is by far, one of the largest, market
leaders in the Globalization industry for Fortune 500 companies
who must have a global presence via the web to their targeted
customers.   SDL is based in the UK, (US HQ in Plano, TX), with
offices in over 26 countries and employing over 730.   We are
publicly traded on the London Stock Exchange, been in business
for  10 years and the only vendor in this space that is profitable.

I'd like to speak with you or a direct report about the potential of
working with Enron for your globalization needs.    Certainly
you  understand the extreme difficulties and expense you may face in
maintaining consistent content and branding across your multiple,
multi-lingual websites.  SDL is a leading globalization infrastructure and
services firm that can streamline those issues while positively impacting
the bottom line.  Our services span from Internationalization (both web
and software), technology (Webflow and ETS), professional services and
worldwide translation services, all developed and orchestrated to work
as a single, seamless effort.    Surely Enron handles alot of this already
but could the current process be made more cost effective as well
as expediting or increasing international revenue from foreign
markets?

SDL also offers ETS, a real time translation product that allows for
instant, multi lingual messaging, email, web based customer support,
etc... Product currently has a significant installed base of clients, in
particular, a joint effort between EDS and the FAA for global emails to
pilots and airports, as well as being used at Lucent as an internal
communications tool.    Again, this type of technology would be use
solely for content/info. one would not normally localize or translate.
ETS Webflow, which will further seperate us from the other static in the
Globalization industry.

I look forward to any suggestions you may have on how and with whom to
proceed further with. Thanks again for your time and have a great day.

Regards,

Michael

More Okie  Betas
[IMAGE][IMAGE]Here I am 50 years old and what have I done with my  life?  Well I do have the  Double-Wide , and the little lady Patsy Joe Dale Bob.  And the illegitimate children.  Caroline JoeDale Bob on who I spent all my aluminum can money , sending her to  Boston College, & Holly JoeDale Bob who will use up the winnings from the  chicken fights sending her to college in South Carolina, then there is little  Tommy Joe Dale Bob who takes after me; he gets the Double wide when I'm gone,  and special  Janie Jane Jane Joe  Dale Bob our baby who works down at the A&W to support our propane  usage.   But surely there is  more to Life.  Had I not consumed  all those free beers at Gordos I would have had more of those brain cells and  I too could have been as successful as the Betas that followed me. I feel so  inadequate when I am invariably compared to the likes of Strobes,  Dent, Rocky, and you know there's Drow  plus that most successful Clay Coburn.   I will feel like the impudent Senior Citizen I am when Johnny Miller  pulls up the Internet link to his front-page success article and the others in  the class of the class of 75.  I  can only hope Beek, my little brother Bless his heart, will send me a Good  pornographic joke.
 
AND Gall Darn It I forgot  two other OKIE Betas  Thems Robert  Margo , Joe Parks and Paul Porter.

"FW: Marketing Off-site","
On behalf of the entire Marketing team, I want to thank you for your candor and time in participating in the off-site last Friday.  

Your vision and personal observations of where and how Marketing can play a more important role for the organization was timely and very well received by the team.  Today, we have a better idea of the areas you would like to see targeted externally and internally i.e., employees. We appreciate your flexibility in exploring new ways to get our messages out and in entertaining new data and proposals throughout the year.

"San Diego Invite","Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

"Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it's time to hump it","All right Shack.  The picture is making me respond to these diatribes, seeing how my puss is front and center in the photo.  (By the way how many of you old farts from '75 can name the others in the picture?) 
I get the impression that you all think -kai- is dead among the class of '76.  That is absolute bulls**t!  I still see many of my pledge brothers on a regular basis as well as many of you ""older"" Betas.  (Had dinner with John Miller last night - and he even paid!) 
My home has always been and will always be open to any Beta who gets his ass to Dallas (except Drow cause he's already here). 
In fact, the SMU class of '76 is indeed hosting a stunning event for alums this Saturday night at the Highland Park estate (on Beverly Drive) of some SAE that I never heard of (apparently a member of the ""lucky sperm club"")  There will be valet parking and more SAE and Phi Delt alums than you can shake a stick at.  They will be all sitting around with their trophy wifes talking about the size of their Porches and bond portfolios (since they all got out of the stock market 18 months ago).  All this for only 75 bucks.  Hmmm, do I want to go there and enjoy a lovely evening with my fellow classmates, or do I want to walk over one block to Mark Paul's and listen to you whiners that have the wherewithall to make it to Dallas bitch and moan about the '76 pledge class.  Could be a tough decision. 
If it wasn't for Beek and Elvis last year, I suspect that you members of the '75 class would have been sitting at home watching reruns of Cartoon Carnival (right Arends?). 
Just remember it was the wisdom and vision of all you whiners that put the guys in that picture together (right C-Paul?)  So quit bitchin and get to Dallas this weekend.  We'll figure out something fun to do!

Benson aka 'Mule'  (thank-you Bill Jordan for that moniker) 
  
Craig Shackleton wrote: I second the nomination Del - multiple clicks.And I offer in the spirit of '75 a helping hand to the 76'ers to use eWooglin to full advantage.  Before eWooglin there was a loose network of Betas exchanging emails with pics of the bros in their glory days.The bros in the attached picture are hereby duty-bound to extend the greatness of Gamma Omega.  Now get to it maggots.-kai-Shack

 Yes, Elvis is still alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1 year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

			 The market soared on the wings of Icarus today? 	
			 Market Summary  	
			 The market soared on the wings of Icarus today? the European Central Banks cut their interest rates after we cut ours earlier this week. Weekly initial jobless claims were down 46,000, and retail sales were up 2.3%. The Dow was up 167, the NASDAQ up 51, and the S&P up 20?The market flew to high to fast and burnt its wing on the sun?The minutes were released from the FOMC showing the 50 point basis cut was a unanimous decision and laying the Fed's uncertainty bare. Profit-takers swooped in and the market fell back to earth with the Nasdaq down 9.76 points or 0.53% at 1827.77, the Dow closing up 33.08 points or 0.35% at 9587.45, and the S&P up 2.73 points or 0.25% at 1118.53.

W's brother is the Governor but remember he lost the first time around.  Yesterday I quipped that a Gore victory by the electoral college but not the popular vote would be bad for Wall Street and Main Street.  My focus was the disparity between the outcomes.  If Bush wins in the same fashion (not the popular mandate) - it will also be problem.  This hasn't happened since the 19 century when notions of popular sovereignty were different - a vast majority of today's citizens would have been legally excluded. A vote for the President is the only one shared by all Americans. It is a personal matter - explanations of victory based on understanding the 18 century origins of the electoral college, won't wash.   A candidate who wins the election with a minority of votes seems antithetical to someone regarded by many people as ""the leader of the free world"".       The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed where they opened.... was this a political statement? To quote Lou Reed: ""I guess I just don't know and I guess I just don't know"".  Some big names took a breather today (moving less than 1%): WMT (Walmart) HD (Home Depot) SUNW (Sun) PEP (Pepsi) KO (Coke) INTC (Intel) C (Citigroup) MMM (Minnesota Mining and Mineral) DIS (Disney) JNJ (Johnson & Johnson) and UPS. The Dow mimicked the sentiment by going up nearly 20 and down over 50 before ending off 25.... In IPOland - Transmeta - TMTA - was pure TNT - up 115% - haven't seen those kinda #s since dot.com days of yore - they make a special chip that uses less power.      -Bram Towbin

They also were unaware that our convertible preferred was non-voting which effectively ruled out doing anything at the June shareholder meeting along the lines they were considering since the record date has passed.

Subject:	Crown Energy

I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

"RE: Enron Guest Speaker","Hi Jeff--
    Hope you're well! Forgive me for taking advantage of my family ties on
this. I'm getting a kick out of the calls I receive with increasing
frequency from people who know my brother is Jeff Skilling and wish to know
whether we're related or, as in the case of the included e-mail, to
investigate a speaker for their group. I don't know whether this is possible
or whether your group does this (I suspect they very well might given
Enron's stellar reputation in this area), Jeff, but I met this fellow at the
AMS annual meeting (actually it was in Los Angeles) a couple of years ago
and he's writing to inquire about a speaker from Enron willing to talk to
the Washington, D.C. American Meteorological Society Chapter about weather
derivatives and the energy industry's interest in the weather.  He an Air
Force major and is clearly well informed and approaching the right folks in
your team to address this issue.  Any chance this can be done?  My guess is
they'd cover all expenses.
     Have to tell you, Jeff, that my VP/General Manager John Vitanovec came
in the other evening and told me he'd just purchased more Enron stock and
the good things he'd heard about it.  I told him I just had bought some
Enron too. I can remember him telling me of his first purchase a year or
more ago. Everybody here knows my brother and I get such a kick out of that.
You're regularly mentioned on our top rated morning show--they had your
picture on just the other morning.
     Sorry to take your time on this, Jeff. Please don't worry about this if
there's any problem with it.  I hope you're well.  Please give my best to
Rebecca and to Sherri!  Take care (and no more pies)!

                     Tom



JEFF---
   Here's the e-mail inquiring about an Enron speaker from Major Kenneth
Carey, U.S. Air Force, The Pentagon.  Thanks!

                                 Tom



Tom

Hello from our Nation's Capital!  You and I met at the AMS Annual Meeting in
San Diego in 1999 (see attached picture of you and I!).  You're very well
known and I applaud all of the good things you're doing for both your
Chicago and national viewers, weather-wise, but, more importantly, your
tremendous and positive community involvement!

 <<Tom Skilling.bmp>>
As a chapter officer with the District of Columbia Chapter of the American
Meteorological Society (DC AMS), I want to get the very best speakers with
inspiring, entertaining, and thought-provoking topics for our chapter
membership.  I can't think of anything much more exciting in our profession
than that of weather derivatives, and the products and services for our
energy and agricultural sector that is a booming part of our field.

I'd like to get someone from Enron to speak at one of our chapter meetings.
I understand you may have an inside track to Enron and I wanted to inquire
if you could help us get an appropriate person to talk to our chapter about
weather for their business ventures.  I'd like to also get someone from the
weather provider perspectives, like a company like EarthSat Corp, so we
could get a better understanding of both the weather provider and customer
perspectives.

I look forward to hearing from you and best of luck with your future
professional and personal endeavors!

Best Regards,
Ken

Vice Chairman, District of Columbia AMS Chapter

GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says ""Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________"",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the

Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

    Thursday, September 20, 2001 Issue 37   EDITORIAL  Last week's events  As most of you may know, Eyeforenergy held its second annual, Energy Exchanges Online  conference last week in New Orleans.  We'd like to thank the wonderful speakers and sponsors who made the event a very successful one.  For those of you interested in what went on you can take a look at the presentations which are up on the website here .   Normally, after a conference, we'd devote the newsletter to a wrap-up of the conference, some major trends we picked out, etc.  With the events of the last week, however, we thought it fitting that this newsletter focus on the effects wreaked on the energy sector by the recent terrorist attacks.  So in the article below you'll get a look at some possible scenarios for the next few months.   We'd like to once again extend our sympathy to the members of the Eyeforenergy community who have lost friends and colleagues, particularly our friends at Tradespark and eSpeed.  (For those of you interested in making a donation to Cantor Fitzgerald, parent company of Tradespark and eSpeed, please go to http://www.espeed.com/donation.html )   One of the best things about the job we do is the opportunity we get to meet some extraordinary people in the course of putting together our events.  It makes it all the harder when we know that we won't be seeing our trusted friends at the next one.    --Allison Robertshaw, Editor    FOCUS   The Sound of Silence   Last week's tragic events struck at the heart of the energy sector and the world will never be the same. While some of us lost family, friends, acquaintances and business associates, all of us share in the loss. Nationals of 47 countries have been declared dead or missing and 58 countries report some of their citizens, said to have been in the United States on September 11, are still among the 5,700 unaccounted for.  For those of us attending the Energy Exchanges Online II conference in New Orleans, it was particularly emotional as we watched some of our friends and associates come to the realization that their offices were...

I wonder if you received my earlier e-mail? The company I mentioned now has
a $1 million project with a US top three LTL client, based on its somewhat
innovative approach to supply chain management.
Is there an exec in Enron who might be interested in talking to the CEO?

"FW: Howard Stevenson in Houston","
Jeff:

Professor Howard Stevenson (Harvard Bus. Sch. - Entrepreneurship) will be in Houston on the 14th or 15th of June to discuss a new case study that HBS is preparing entitled ""Modern Giants"".  Professor Stevenson would like to feature Enron in the case and has requested a brief meeting with you followed up with lunch with any available HBS alumni.

I have attached an email from the HBS Director of Development who contacted me, which summarizes the proposed case and provides a bio on Professor Stevenson.  Are you interested in Enron's participation in the Case Study? and would you be available for a brief meeting with Professor Stevenson - and possibly lunch?

In my view, we need to refresh the Enron story being told through HBS Case Studies.  The Dabhol Power Case (still being used) is dated and does not reflect our business strategy.  I have asked HBS to contact your office directly to check your availability.

Regards,
Brian

Brian,

It was good to meet you last week in Houston.  Thanks for taking the time
to see me and for giving me an overview of Enron, our alumni there, and
what you are up to.  I'm glad the recruiting seems to have gone well for
you this year.

Thank you, also, for helping us put together a group of our alumni at Enron
during Howard Stevenson's trip in June.  Howard will be in town June 13th -
15th.  Would it be possible to arrange a lunch at Enron on Thursday June
14th or Friday June 15th? Ideally, it would be great to give Howard and
Jeff Skilling the chance to meet together first, say at 11:00 or 11:30,
followed by lunch with our alumni.

I've attached Howard's bio, as well as the electronic version of the Modern
Giants proposal as promised.  In addition, I will fax you a list of HBS
alumni at Enron. Howard would be glad to discuss a wide range of HBS
matters, including the Modern Giants project.  If the lunches on these
dates do not work, let me know and hopefully we can work out an alternative.

  Many thanks, Brian.  I'll follow up with you some time next week, but
feel free to call me any time.

Cheers,
Josh

"RE: Interview","Joannie: Thank you very much. I appreciate Jeff giving me a few minutes out of his busy schedule (May 24 at 3:00 p.m.). Here are some questions that are pertinent for our discussion. 

Are there two or three experiences you look back on having been especially valuable in helping develop your leadership style? Why did you find them valuable?

How have your views on leadership changed over time?

How do you think organizational changes or global changes impact on leadership styles?

What motivates you and how do you motivate others?

Do you ever have time to reflect on your leadership style in a particular instance? if so, what process do you use for evaluation?

What are the most important leadership skills for the energy industry? Does leadership style change for other industries, such as the airline industry or the automobile industry?

Subject:	Interview


In order to prepare a paper for my graduate class on Leadership, I would like to interview you as a leader. Some questions that would be of interest would be what events conspired to bring you to Enron, what developmental process you knowingly (or unknowingly) went through in your early years and what challenges have you encountered that made a significant change in your career.

If you would be amenable and have the time, I would like to interview you sometime next week for about 30-40 minutes. If you wish, I could provide you questions in advance to maximize your time.

"Re: [smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush","
Hess,
I forgive you brother.  I wasn't ready to listen when I was at  college.  In fact, I remained stubborn and resisted the TRUTH until I was  35.  Anyway, though you may not have shared the gospel with me, you were a  powerful witness for HIM just the same.
Thank you for your love, courage and service for the Lord.
God bless,
Beek

Dear Beta Bros,
     I fully intended to  respond to Woody's e-mail and forward about 
President Bush much more  quickly than this.  I noticed that there was no 
response out there  when Woody posted this and I didn't want him to
feel so lonely, so here  goes... (warning: this is not lighthearted fare!)
      I'm sure that life for all of us has changed to some extent since  
September 11th.  That day was a vivid reminder that I don't have a  choice in 
determining how or when I'm going to die (barring suicide of  course), but I 
do have a choice about how I'm going to live.   September 11th and the events 
which continue to unfold have caused me to  focus a whole lot more on what's 
truly important in life- family,  relationships, faith.
     Believing that those  terrorists were willing to die for a lie, I've 
been forced to ask myself-  what am I willing to sacrifice for what I believe 
is the  TRUTH?
     For many of you guys, I confess, I failed  to personally share what I 
believed was the truth, even back in  college.  I was not willing to 
sacrifice acceptance- a hard thing for  a college kid to give up. Forgive me 
for that.
      [Unbelievably, just after I wrote that last statement I was interrupted 
by  a telephone call from the father of a guy named Gary Vale who some of you  
may have known. He was a football player and on my freshman floor at  SMU.  I 
wish I had room to tell you Gary's whole story.  In  short, we were friends, 
I watched him begin trashing his life in the  Spring semester but failed to 
try to help much.  Gary became an  alcoholic, just sobering up three years 
ago.  But, too late to  recover from damage that had been done.  He walked 
into my life again  two months ago when, through a series of ""coincidences,"" 
he ended up at  our church.  His father just called to tell me that Gary died 
last  night.  I can't help but wonder if this tragedy could have been avoided  
had I done more in the Spring of '72? So, it's now with grief and an even  
greater sense of urgency that I write this  today.]
     If recent events have moved you to a place  of searching and seeking, 
please read on and allow me a few moments of  your time to share what I've 
experienced as real truth about real  life.
     I've found the evidence to be very  compelling that this planet and all 
it contains (including us), is the  design of a very imaginative Creator.  
That Creator is not an  impersonal force, or removed and simply ""watching us 
from a distance."" He  is a personal being who knows His creation and 
desperately desires to be  known by them.  He so much desires to be known by 
us that, in a  manner that will remain a mystery until we see Him face to 
face, He became  a man in the person of Jesus Christ.
     Some think  perhaps Jesus was merely a great teacher or prophet.  
However, I  realized that in order to be intellectually honest I could not 
accept  that.  Jesus claimed to be God; and he claimed to hold the key to  
people's eternal destiny.  Jesus'claims left only three  options.  He was 
either a liar (the worst kind because he deceived  people about their 
eternity), a lunatic, or, he was who he said he was- he  was Lord.
     Could God love me that much, to go that  far?  To allow His own Son to 
come and show us and teach us what God  is like? To die on a cross to pay the 
penalty of my sin and obtain my  forgiveness? To rise from the dead to secure 
the opportunity to have a  personal relationship with God both now and  
forever?
     Personally, I've found all of the  above to be true.  God is a personal 
God.  Jesus is Lord.   And, God does love me that much- to suffer the death 
of His own Son in  order to offer real life (now and forever) to me and 
anyone else who is  willing to do just one thing...  receive that gift; just 
accept  Him.
     A number of years ago I did accept Him.   And, in doing that, I've 
experienced everything He said to be true.   Life has not been problem-free.  
That's not what He promised, in  fact, Jesus assured us that we will have 
problems in this life.  But,  He has always personally been there. He has 
always given His strength,  wisdom, guidance, peace, contentment, patience, 
encouragement, hope, and  love. [These Scriptures tell about it: John 3:16, 
Romans 5:8, Romans 6:23,  Ephesians 2:8-9, 1 Corinthians 13, and many more]
      As Woody's e-mail stated, it is encouraging to know where this 
President  is turning at such a time as this.  Thank God that's a personal  
relationship that's offered to anyone who seeks it, not just the big boys.  
Thanks for giving me a few moments to share these  thoughts.
      If you'd like to talk more about  this, I'd love to do so.  My phone 
number is 918-743-8897 (office),  918-298-6144 (home) and my e-mail addresses 
are pastorhess@hotmail.com,or,  hess@shbc-tulsa.org.  I wish I could be at 
more of the gatherings,  but weekends are a tough time to get away in this 
business!  May God  bless you all.

EXECUTIVE BRIEF

FOR

OCTANE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEMS, USA

Loan Amount: $60,000,000 USD
Type of Project: Manufacturing Facilities
Loan Term (maturity): 10-15 years
Project Venture Share: Between 30 and 50%, depending on the Lender's proposed
split between equity investment and loan.
Funding Stage: Straight-debt funding, equity investment or a combination of
both for a start-up without a financial history requiring capital for
facility construction.
Objective: The employment of its technology in a world-class refinery to
upgrade low value petroleum feedstocks into aviation fuel and marketable
ultra high octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.
Market: The Client Company's process for making unleaded gasoline has been
operated on a semi-plant scale for several months and the products
successfully sold to independent gasoline distributors.
Company Investment: The Client Company's project team members have invested
six years and in excess of $1.5 Million USD in developing the technology.  In
addition, the management team is comprised of eight individuals who have
between them over 200 years of successful experience in the petrochemical
industry in R&D, project management, and refinery management.
Total Asset Value: At the time of the completion of loan draw down will be in
excess of $153,000,000 US. (See 'Asset Value with Facilities')

Purpose:
Phase I  - Ammonia fertilizer
Phase II  - Reclaimed solvents
Phase III  - Pollution Free Gasoline

1. Company Introduction - The Client Company was formed specifically to
commercialize its proprietary technology and the expertise for:

1) The conversion of low BTU natural gas in ammonia for fertilizer.

2) Specialty refining and reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates from
plastics manufacturing in order to convert these streams into products that
can be sold as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

3) The refining of low value petroleum feedstocks into pollution free
aviation fuel and marketable ultra high octane blending stock for unleaded
gasoline.

4) The reclamation/refining of spent chlorinated solvents in order to market
these streams as unleaded gasoline and diesel fuel.

5) The employment of its technology in a world-class refinery to upgrade low
value petroleum feedstocks into aviation fuel and marketable ultra high
octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

In order to minimize the overall risk and the time required to achieve a
positive cash flow, the Client Company has developed a multi phase Strategic
Production Plan

Phase I is the smallest of the phases and will employ the Client Company's
expertise in ammonia production from low BTU natural gas.  Phase I can be
completed and show a profit within seven months of initial funding.

Phase II is somewhat larger than phase I and will employ its own unique
proprietary technology and a separate geographical facility location.  Phase
II can be completed within about twelve to fourteen month after funding and
the will show a profit about two months after startup. The future of this
phase of the Client Company's strategic plan is somewhat less clear today
than it appeared several months ago when the plan was developed.  The recent
dramatic rise in energy prices in the US has caused some generators of the
spent solvents that will be the feedstock for this facility to begin using
these streams for fuel.  A reevaluation of this situation is underway at the
present time and the decision as to the future of this phase will be made in
late first quarter of 2001.

Phase III, although much more capital intensive than phase II, has been
separated from phase IV for several reasons:

1. Environmental permits - the Phase III facility will be purely a petroleum
processing facility similar in principle to several hundred other petroleum
processing facilities in the State of Texas, and therefore, obtaining an air
emissions and operating permit should not take over six months.  In contrast
to this, the permits for the reclamation of the hazardous chlorinated
solvents, Phase IV, will require between ten and eighteen months if all goes
well.

2. Equipment deliveries - the technology to be employed and the absence of
corrosive compounds in the processes for Phase III will allow the equipment
and piping to be fabricated out of common carbon steel rather than the exotic
alloys, which will be required for the Phase IV, chlorinated solvent
reclamation process.

3. Transportation - the handling of the petroleum feedstocks and products for
Phase III are much simpler than the chlorinated solvent feedstocks for Phase
IV.

Phase IV will utilize a location in the US while Phase V will probably be
located in the Caribbean.

2. History of Project: The project team members have invested six years and
in excess of 1.5 MILLION DOLLARS US in developing the technology and the
business opportunities which are described herein.

3. Mission Statement: The Client Company's mission is to capitalize on the
business opportunities it identifies, profitably employ its proprietary
technology, and where possible assist in solving environmental problems.

4. Funding Stage: Is a start-up without a financial history and is seeking
capital for facility construction and startup - straight debt funding, equity
investment or a combination of both.

5. Project Ownership? / Management
THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
The management team is comprised of eight individuals who between them have
over 200 years of successful experience in the petrochemical industry in R&D,
project management, and refinery management.  In addition the team includes
another individual with in excess of 25 years of financial experience in
banking, investment banking and financial management.

THE SCHEDULE
From the point of the first financial draw approximately 6 to 7 months will
be required to construct the phase I plant, go through startup and be ready
to commence full-scale production.  The other phases will follow as indicated
above.

6. Unique Features (Key Considerations) of Project:

Ammonia production - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its principals' expertise in fertilizer production and
marketing and their successful experience in adapting proven processes to
unique opportunities.  The Client Company is in the process of finalizing a
gas purchasing agreement with a firm that has acquired the mineral rights to
large area of land in west Texas under which is located a significant deposit
of low BTU natural gas.  The Client Company can purchase this gas at very
attractive pricing.  While this gas is not suitable for sale as ""pipeline""
quality gas it is suitable for the production of ammonia.

Solvent reclamation - This phase of the Client Company's strategic plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology and its principals' expertise in
reclaiming spent solvent streams and rafinates, and refining them into usable
fuels.  Some of these are currently being incinerated as hazardous waste and
others are being blended into low value products.  The Client Company's
proprietary refining technology has the ability to process these materials
and convert them into value added products.

Pollution free gasoline - This Phase of the Strategic Production Plan will
commercialize its proprietary technology for the refining of low value
petroleum feedstocks into pollution free aviation fuel and marketable ultra
high octane blending stock for unleaded gasoline.

The Client Company will utilize ABC Industries to broker its products and
assist in feedstock procurement. ABC Industries currently arranges for the
supply of feedstock to DEF Fuels, one of the Client Company's major
customers, and brokers their products.  ABC Industries will also
broker/market to other customers any left over high-octane blend stock and
all of the aviation gasoline.

The Client Company plans to offer its unleaded gasoline at a price of
one-half to one cent below the locally posted rack price.  Rack price is the
price that a distributor pays for products at the terminal loading rack and
varies somewhat from day to day and though out the year as gasoline demand
and crude oil prices vary.

FEEDSTOCK SUPPLY - The feedstock for the ammonia facility will be low BTU
natural gas from the gas field directly under and surrounding the facility.
The feedstock for the solvents reclamation will be obtained directly from the
generators of the spent solvents.  The feedstock for the gasoline production
facility will be obtained from several LPG producers in the West Texas area.

The cost of the majority of the Client Company's feedstocks have historically
tracked the price of crude oil as has the price of gasoline at the rack and
retail pump.  The solvent feed stocks will be procured from the generators
with the aid of several brokers who normally deal in these materials.  These
spent solvents will be shipped to the Client Company facility at the port by
truck, railroad tank car and barge.

THE TECHNOLOGY - The Client Company has developed its own proprietary
technology for:

1. The refining/reclamation of spent solvents and rafinates and their
conversion into value added products.
2.  The production of ultra high octane blend stock for use in unleaded
gasoline and aviation fuel.
3.   The reclamation of chlorinated solvents.

The possibility of patent protection for these technologies is being explored
with one patent already filed.  Initial patent searches do not indicate any
potential infringement of existing patents, but the Client Company makes no
representation as to the ability to secure patent protection.  However, every
effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the nature of the
processes that the Client Company will employ in its facilities.

The Client Company process for making unleaded gasoline has been operated on
a semi-plant scale for several months and the products successfully sold to
independent gasoline distributors.

The plants will be designed to meet all of the current standards including
EPA, API, OSHA, ASME and good engineering practice.

THE COMPETITION - The Phase I operation will face very limited competition
because the ammonia plants which in the past have served the west Texas, New
Mexico, and western Oklahoma area have all been shut down during the past
several years.  Therefore, all of the ammonia consumed in the region is being
shipped in by truck or railcar.  The Client Company believes that freight
considerations alone will provide sufficient cost differential to insure that
it can successfully sell its 50,000 tons per year of product into the local
market.

The Phase II operation will face very limited competition because we have
been able to identify only one dedicated facility that is doing work similar
to what the Client Company will be doing.  The main advantage the Client
Company will enjoy is the ability to assure the generators of the spent
solvents and rafinates that their waste will be processed in such a manner,
and with the high level quality control which only a dedicated facility can
maintain, that the end products will be of such quality that the generator
will no longer face the present contingent liability caused by product
failure in their final application.

For the Phase III facility at Dallas Texas, the Client Company will face very
little local competition for its ultra high-octane blend stock and reasonable
competition for its aviation fuel.  At the present time there does not exist
any local producer of ultra high-octane blend stock and it along with
aviation fuel is being shipped in from the Gulf Coast and other more distant
suppliers.  Others who might attempt to duplicate the Client Company's
approach will not have access to the Client Company's proprietary technology
and will be at a distinct economic disadvantage. At the present time the
Client Company is not aware of competition that might tend to drive up prices
for the petroleum feedstocks (i.e., normal and isobutane) that will be used
in its Phase II process.  These feedstocks are available in more than
adequate quantities at the prices used to calculate the proforma's.

7. Overview of Market: - The overall nationwide market for unleaded gasoline
is in excess of 342,000,000 gallons per day. The overall nationwide market
for aviation fuel (100 octane gasoline) is in excess of 67,000,000 gallons
per day.  The local Dallas Texas market for aviation fuel is in excess of
750,000 gallons per day.  This market is expected to grow about 2% per year
for the foreseeable future. The Client Company has set as its corporate
objective to capture 15% of the Dallas aviation gasoline market over the next
five years.

Approximately six billion gallons per year solvents are used in the US for
various cleaning applications.  The disposal of the resulting hazardous waste
is a major cost for the user.  The Client Company will use these spent
solvent blends as a feedstock and thereby remove the ""hazardous waste""
designation from the material.  At a processing rate of 100,000 gallons per
day the Client Company will process about 0.6% of the solvents that are
available for recycle or reclamation in the US.

8. Financial Overview (USD) - see the attached proforma.

9. Use of Funds - see the attached sources and uses statement. (The numbers
are solid to use at project.  In the loan amount, we have add the pre-funding
cost)


ASSET VALUE OF the Client Company W/FACILITIES

TECHNOLOGY - Within 18 months of initial funding the Client Company will have
the following patent applications filed and assigned to the Client Company:

1. Composition of matter patent covering its butane isomerization catalyst.

2. Composition of matter patent covering its structured/ solid alkalation
catalyst.

3. A process patent covering its chlorinated solvent reclamation catalyst.
 
4. A process patent covering its process for the optimum dispersion of light
hydrocarbons in ethanol.

5. A process patent for its process for the reclamation of an existing waste
solvent.

6. A process patent for its process for benzene destruction in Platformate.

7. Several (3+) process patents for the reclamation of spent solvents and
rafinates.

The patent searches for all of these have been completed and in the informal
opinion of our patent attorney all of these patents will probably be granted.

Number 1 & 2, above, can currently be obtained from UOP and Phillips
Petroleum, for example, for about a million dollars per year (royalty or
technology fee) each.  Once we have fully proven these two in long-term plant
performance tests, the Client Company may well elect to market this
technology.

By present day appraisal methods, (i.e. actual and estimated royalty values)
these patents will be worth between five and seven million dollars per year
to the Client Company.  Using standard ""future value"" calculations (ten
years, 3% inflation) the asset value of these patents is $67,800,000.

LAND - Dallas Texas  - It is the Client Company's intention to purchase
approximately 100 acres of land in Texas as the site for the Dallas / Ft 
Worth facility.  A portion of this land will be purchased

DAMN, I STILL CANNOT BELIEVE I COULD KICK IT OVER YOUR HEAD AND STILL GET IT UNDER THE F'IN BAR!!!!!

I relived that awful moment tonight for my two nieces (Joe and Ellen Stutts' daughters) Sarah and Katy and one of their neighbors (Parker Hill) that plays soccer for Tomball High School (the only Texas High School team to go to Mexico, D.F. representing the U.S. high schools against Mexico's, and several South American national high school teams).

And I am sure you are asking what occasion would cause me to recall this day of infamy for these young titans.  Young (and lovely) Sarah has a car packed tonight and leaves for her freshman year at (yes, that's right) S M U tomorrow.  Are there any Beta legacies that she should know about out there?  Let me know who I should be in touch with, old Keeper of the Flame.

    Thursday, September 06, 2001 Issue 36   EDITORIAL  Consumers, Consolidation, and Cocktails                                                                          It's been an interesting week for the energy industry.  A number of recent announcements hint at some long term changes in the way the energy industry will look 15 years from now.  International Fuel Cells  have announced that Woking, UK will be the home of the first commercial fuel cell in the UK (for more information on this story see the article below), and Puget Sound Energy  is extending their conservation program that takes advantage of real-time pricing for consumers.  It would seem that the long-promised benefits of fuel cells are turning the corner and are beginning to offer a viable commercial alternative.  Consumers are soon to be faced with even more options on where they get their power from, and with the increasingly ability of utilities to pass on the real costs and benefits of their power choices, their choice will be an important one.  It opens up a world where consumers will develop a relationship with their power supplier as they're forced to look at where they get their power from and when they use it.  It's been a while in the making, and it seems that the recent power crises in the States have given it the push it needed to turn the corner.   As dramatically as the downstream and retail side of the energy industry is set to change in the next 12 months, the wholesale energy market continues to face almost daily changes.  One of the articles in this week's briefing is an interview  with Canada's Watt-Ex.  It would seem that while cross US-Canadian energy trading is developing apace, there are still a number of hurdles on both sides of the fence to be overcome.  Recent announcements at Enron in the past week or two, suggest that Energy's golden boy is having a few teething problems... is this the opportunity for rivals like the ICE, TradeSpark, and Dynegy to consolidate their recent gains?  And what does it mean for exchanges like HoustonStreet and RedMeteor that have been struggling of late?  There's a lot of talk about consolidation and it seems to be picking up steam...   On a final note, you probably know that the Eyeforenergy team is going to be down in New Orleans next week for our Energy Exchanges Online II event.  We look forward to seeing some familiar faces and meeting some new ones down there, as well as getting all the latest news over a hurricane or two.

his

"Eyeforenergy Announces Next European Events","

Eyeforenergy is pleased to announce the latest in its series of trading
events for the energy community.  Taking place from the 19-21st of
February, 3 key, strategic events will be co-located in Amsterdam
offering delegates the opportunity to network with all the right people:

EEO Europe: Energy Trading in the New Economy

EEO Europe is the third in our successful energy trading series and
the first time we're running the event in Europe. Addressing the core
issues for energy traders such as: counterparty risk in online trading,
online security, the changing role of the energy broker, and mitigating
corporate risk, this conference will bring together Europe's leading
companies taking advantage of the deregulating energy markets. The energy
trading arena in Europe is changing at lightening speed--what was true
yesterday won't be true tomorrow. Consolidating exchanges, new entrants to
the market, the latestsoftware developments--do you know where you
stand?--and do you know where your competitors stand?

For full information simply go to: www.eyeforenergy.com/eurotrading

Weather Trading Europe 2002

Weather derivatives have become the latest tool for Energy companies
to handle to their risk. Are you familiar with how weather futures and
insurance can help you avoid getting caught out? Do you know where you
can trade energy and who's offering the data you need to make your
decisions? These questions as well as a full discussion of the latest
weather trading strategies will be on offer at the event. It'll be your
opportunity to discover how to take advantage of this growing opportunity.

Full details can be found at: www.eyeforenergy.com/weather


Emissions Trading Europe 2002

Clearly emissions trading options are ripe for the picking - so how
can you make sure you're ready to profit from GHG? Let's face it -you
can't really afford not to be, especially as the World Bank has estimated
demand in the international GHG trading system to be in the order of
US$20 billion per annum by 2010. What do you need to do to take advantage
of this new opportunity? Who's leading the way?

To find out the latest go to: www.eyeforenergy.com/emissions


This will be the biggest European trading event of the year. Don't miss out!

"EventAmerica Intro & Offer","Jeffrey...

Hope your transition to your next endeavor is smooth and you get some
time to relax and enjoy your past work efforts.  While you are relaxing
by the pool, maybe you could read some of the attached documents and
consider becoming an advisor to our Company?

I realize that our business model is out of your industry focus but we
believe you have the expertise and knowledge of corporate management to
help us.  On a side note, our Chairman/CEO, Eliot Barton, spent 10 years
in the oil business in Colorado.  Maybe you will also find our project a
nice diversion from everything you've been through lately.

I would like to introduce you to EventAmerica, the event entertainment
marketplace (to be).  We plan on becoming the dominate brand in
""individual"" VIP hospitality, the dominate brand for event information
on the Web and have a cable network idea to wrap all around our vision.
We also have a great foundation idea that will act as a ""sister""
corporation and help us ""give back"" and build our brand even stronger.
We envision a global rollout of our model.

We truly believe we can be a top entertainment company with an expansive
global presence.  We want to be the ""best"" to market, not the fastest,
etc.  Hopefully you are a sports enthusiast and may have attended
several events whereby you can relate to what we are going to offer our
customers.  If you get a chance, please see the website of one of our
new advisors, Jeff Cable, at www.prosportmktg.com.  Jeff is going to
introduce us to Joe Montana and several other athletes and will take our
business plan directly to Harris Barton of www.championventures.com.

Thank you for considering our offer and we look forward to speaking if
and when you are available.  My direct line is 831.763.9443.  Eliot's is
831.724.8082.

Have a great rest of the summer.

Sincerely,

jbm

"June 1 Deep Dive/Houston","Jeff:

The whole team and I very much enjoyed our meeting with you last Friday.  We were looking forward to having the opportunity to tell you all about the progress of our business.  We felt that the give and take and the dialogue during the course of the meeting was excellent, and we hope that in the future we will be able to have useful dialogues like this at appropriately periodic intervals.

To memorialize the follow-up steps from this, we thought it would be useful to write this down so we may remain responsive to your questions regarding our progress.

	1.	We want to confirm the reasonableness of our net churn numbers; we plan to develop a fact base of churn experience over the course of the next few months and analyze these compared to the original business case model.  We would be prepared to review this churn with you in about three months.

	2.	To analyze the rationale of our hedging of long term contracts against the ""disaster"" of falling prices; this is to be done against the assumption that our customers will leave us on the basis of strict economic rationality. We believe that providing this type of analysis would be very useful for us as we enter the year 2002 where power and gas prices will be substantially different next year than they are now.  We would be prepared to review the results of this analysis with you in the fall.

	3.	Decompose our net cash burn to indicate the ""levers"" to reduce that cash burn against unforeseen problems/disasters.  We would plan to do this as part of our normal budgeting process for 2002. We would plan to review this with our Board in our fall meeting. We believe that it is the right course of activity to review this with the Board and then follow up with you if there are any questions going forward.  We also believe that there could be an opportunity to review the cash burn significantly given the fact that a large part of our cash burn is spent on systems development for entry into specific markets.

Jeff, as I said in the beginning, we very enjoyed meeting with you and we hope that we were able to prove to you that we have made substantial progress.  I would like to feel that I will have the opportunity to get in touch with you at key juncture intervals during the development of our company.

Thanks again for your time.

"Pictures","Hi Mark;   Thank you for the comments on Macedonia.  I take it you have
started your book since you said ""Details will be in the book!""
      Not much new here most excitement is about a May 5 Wedding!!
      The White Sox are having a slow start with a 4-7 record and neither the
hitting or pitching very good.  However the season is young ---- I hope.
What makes even worse is that the Cubs are on top of their division with a
8-4 record.
      The weather has improved though we had snow showers yesterday.  A good
thing you are not going to Canada this year.

"[smu-betas] new members","Gamma Omega Beta Bros.,

Greetings from colorful Vermont.

Recently, E.Wooglin.Com has approved 2 requests to be a member of our SMU
Beta Group:

                                                Justin Loweth
                                                A. Carty

I am not familiar with either of these fellows as is the case, I'm sure,
with many of our members.  Under the circumstances I thought that it
would be appropriate to ask each of you guys (y'all...if you prefer) to
reply to this message with a message of your own.  We want to know  who
the hell you are.  Please include an introduction and any other
appropriate information that will get us better acquainted.

For your information:  We are Gamma Omega Betas.  Most of the members
were in the class of '75.  There are also members from earlier and later
classes ('72 thru '78).  This e-mail group was established to facilitate
continued contact among old friends, providing a forum for organizing
reunions, other get togethers and sharing important ""family"" information.
 Everyone seems to be able to accomplish these tasks with a great deal of
humor and foolishness.

We look forward to becoming acquainted...and hopefully entertained in the
process.

Subject: Meeting with Jeff Skilling at Enron


Masa:

I enjoyed our evening together on the boat in Yokohama harbor very
much.  As promised, I have been in contact with Jeff Skilling at Enron.
He is interested in meeting with you.

I have been speaking with Jeff's assistant regarding appropriate dates
and mentioned the dates when you will be in New York in May.  I suggest
that your respective offices work together to settle the logistical
details.  Joannie Williamson will handle the arrangements for Jeff.
(e-mail: joannie.williamson@enron.com; phone: 713-345-7774)

I am sure you will have a very interesting conversation.

If I can help in any other way, please let me know.

Very best regards,

Ted

The BMC Tour of Houston has been cancelled. 
Unfortunately, a large portion of the racers would be coming in from international countries and the Federal Aviation Association is not planning to clear international flights for US landing until after the weekend, leaving the bulk of the riders not in Houston at the time of the race.
The Tour committee will be meeting next week to decide if this race will be rescheduled. If the race is rescheduled, it will not be for many weeks to come. Please check our website www.bikebarntexas.com <http://www.bikebarntexas.com> for future details. We apologize for this inconvenience. Please feel free to email us with any questions. 
Thank you for your understanding.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Image of Enron in India","
Respected Sir,   
I'd worked with Enron India for 18 months and I'd admired the company for quite some time. Finally I got the opportunity to work with Enron in India and being an Indian I thought it would be privilege for me to serve my home country working in such a respectable company. I really enjoyed my stay but I found Enron India opposite to my belief. I would like to share with you few experience to help you take some steps to safeguard the image of the organization and prevent its further damage.
 
?        There has been no standard policy for anything like travel, compensation, accounts and few old anchors of Enron India who were having very close proximity with CEO (Sanjay) had been enjoying the kingdom with their own methods. 
?        New Delhi office has been the best example of high level of unprofessionally and corruption especially in office Administration where concerned executive used to take undue advantage of the strong relationship with CEO and lack of procedures and guidelines. I'd seen Admin Manger misusing office cars, mobile phones in abundance.
?        Being a liaison office and less proximity from Mumbai office, a Sr. VP had created a well protected fort where nobody could raise any resistance even if one clearly just to realize that these people have so strong roots.
?        Admin person used to take all kinds of favors to give them orders despite better competitors. This includes AC contractor, CAR dealers, carpenters and other office suppliers.
?        An admin Manager (Jaya Kumar) has got assets worth three times whole life compensation is worth considering to prove the fact the all is not well with Enron India with so many such people around. 
?        Although lots of improvement has been done during the past 4-5 months by HR and present CEO (WADE) but still these people could survive and instrumental in leaking confidential information to ex-CEO/Media and making good money.
 
I believe Enron is a very reputed and professional organization and my sentiments are still the same but considering the sensitivity of situation under current circumstances, somebody should keep a watch on Sr. VP and Admin Manager duo who had been together for almost 8 years (They were together even before joining Enron India) and audit all the transaction done by them for the last couple of years.

As I mentioned, Jerry is in transit in Europe at the moment, and it will be
extremely difficult for me to get hold of him again today to reschedule.
Given the time difference involved I will not be able to contact him before
the appointed time tomorrow, and therefore I'd very much appreciate if we
could go ahead with the call as planned.  At least that way Mr. Skilling can
decide which of the dinners he would prefer to attend, I assume that the

"The Morning Market Call - Monday April 23rd, 2001."," <<MF April 23rd 2001.pdf>>

			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

At the end of 2000, a new Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) was
adopted by the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule
greatly enhances an insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate
shares during blackout periods.

We, the Local Guys would like our readers to know of this new rule change
because of its significant advantages over the prior insider trading rules.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.

Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.  The new rule contains other
restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.

Please email us or call us for more information.

*Although its still early in the quarter, we worry that what is typically a
seasonally strong quarter for Oracle could prove to be
unusually weak given the tough U.S. macroeconomic environment and
potentially weakening conditions in international markets.
*Apparently, more Sun servers are sold running Oracle software than anything
else. Weak results and guidance from Sun only serve
to compound our near-term worries.
*We believe that IBM with DB2 is exerting some price pressure on Oracle and
is gaining momentum with Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs being two high profile firms making big commitments to DB2.
*With its rise over the last two weeks, shares of Oracle are trading at a
significant premium to the historic range both on a PE and
revenue multiple basis despite near-term uncertainty. Lowering earnings
estimates and rating to 2-Buy.

*We are initiating coverage of Agere, a communications components gorilla.
We note that the valuation is low but given slowdowns in
capital spending and inventories and margin contraction we would prefer to
stay on the sidelines until fundamentals improve.
*We are establishing C01 revenues of $4.1 billion (-20% y/y) and C02
revenues of $4.4 billion (up 8% y/y) and EPS of a loss of $0.15
and a loss of $0.02.
*Agere had 31% of revenues in optoelectronics and 69% in ICs in Dec:00. The
vast majority of optoelectronics is in active
components and modules. In ICs, roughly 10% is in storage, 10% in wireless
terminals and infrastructure, 12% in wireless LAN,
37% in access (SLICs, modems) and 31% in communications. Agere tends to sell
most IC products in the form of ASICs
manufactured internally. Agere's only large customer is Lucent which was 17%
of revenues in December.

*We believe Exodus will have an opportunity to ""Clear the Decks"" of bad news
during 1Q01 earnings. If so, we believe investors
should begin to aggressively buy the stock.
*If EXDS reports weak bookings and brings down 2001 revenue guidance to
street consensus, it will ""clear the decks"" of further bad
news. Under this scenario, we would suggest investors become more aggressive
in purchasing the stock, despite lack of future
visibility.
*The primary scenario where we would remain cautious would be if EXDS
reports weak bookings and does not lower 2001 revenue
guidance.
*Based on three different valuation analysis, we believe EXDS has a
favorable 2 to 1 reward/risk ratio from current levels.

Paper & Forest Products P. Ruschmeier, .212.526.9898
Rally in Wood Product Markets Picking Up Steam
*As the rally in wood products picks up steam, we are reiterating our
favorable ratings on the following wood product producers: LPX,
GP, WY, BCC, TIN, BOW, and to a lesser degree, IP.
*The rally in wood product markets picked up steam last week as cash prices
for plywood, OSB, and lumber jumped 9%, 9%, and 3%,
respectively. The rally is supported by 1) seasonal strength, 2) sharply
lower interest rates, 3) firm demand, 4) low pipeline
inventories, and 5) GP's plans to permanently close 1.4% of North American
plywood capacity. In addition, the Department of
Commerce will likely rule today on whether to investigate countervailing
duties.
*If the current rally in wood product markets continues, the risk to our
estimates will be on the upside.

*Our confidence in healthy SONET sales continues unabated and we believe the
current slowdown in sales of the TITAN 5500 solely
reflects service provider spending uncertainty and not a fundamental
architectural shift or any slackening in demand for high
bandwidth services.
*Actual March quarter sales of $772 mil met our revised projection of $772
mil with final EPS of $0.29 in line with our expectations.
*We now project sales and EPS including g/w amort of $3.6 billion and $1.55
in 2001 and $4.439 billion and $2.00 in 2002. Our new

2002 (10% growth), TITAN 6500 and 6100 system of
$175 mil in 2001 and $340 mil in 2002, and continue to expect initial sales
of both in 2Q.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Commodity Chemicals S. Vasnetsov, .212.526.3212
Instead of flowers, spring brings drought in chemical
*On our recent research trip, we found that US chemical industry continues
to struggle with slow demand in April, contrary to
typically robust seasonal demand pattern. We expect recovery in chemical
demand only in late 2001, followed by improvement in
cash margins in early 2002.
*In the winter of 2000-01, the US commodity chemicals saw the worst
operating conditions since 1985.
*The hope was that conditions will improve in the spring 2001, as less
expensive oil and gas, coupled with more robust seasonal
demand, will help to improve both sales volume and cash margins.
*So far, this widely expected improvement has NOT happen, as our research
trip uncovered. We expect that on upcoming 1Q
conference calls companies will offer more cautious outlook for 2Q'01 and
for the entire year.

"...","A married couple is driving down the interstate doing 55 mph. The
husband is behind the wheel. His wife looks over at him. ""Honey, I know
we've been married for 15 years, but, I want a divorce.""

The husband says nothing but slowly increases speed to 60 mph.

""I don't want you to try to talk me out of it, because I've been having
an affair with your best friend, and he's a better lover than you.""

Again the husband stays quiet and just speeds up as his anger increases.

""I want the house also."" Again the husband speeds up, and now is doing
75 mph.

""I want the kids too."" The husband just keeps driving faster and faster,
now he's up to 85 mph.  ""And I want the car, the checking account, and
all the credit cards.""

The husband slowly starts to veer toward a bridge overpass piling as the
speedometer reaches 90 mph. ""You're taking this incredibly calmly,"" the
wife says. ""Isn't there anything that you want?""

""No, I have everything I need.""

""What's that?""

"The Morning Market Call - Tuesday September 4th, 2001."," <<MF September 4th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Last week, the markets got so oversold, that the ARMS Index (a technical
market measure that, broadly speaking, indicates how oversold the market
is),
closed above 2.00 on two consecutive days for the first time since Oct. 16
and 19, 1987!! It is, apparently, one of the rarest occurrences in the world
of technical analysis. As we said, it has been 14 years since the the
markets generated such a reading. The NYSE is currently rallying however,
tech is still struggling.
Lets hope today's strength translates broadly across all sectors.

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.49%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.98%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.55%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $26.94 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.37 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Wireline Services B. Bath, .202.452.4732
Cutting '02 RBOC Ests; Commercial Mkt Slowdown Persists
*Lowering '02 revenue, cashflow, EPS and capex forecasts for RBOCs as ""Data
Economy"" remains weak. Commercial data markets
remain particularly slow and we believe some sectors of this market, namely
emerging carrier wholesale and IRUs, are likely to
experience yoy declines in '02, reversing a key growth driver over the last
few years. Business voice revenues, commercial
advertising and international markets are also impacted by similar volume
declines.
*However, we believe the RBOCs are most able to weather the slowdown and
will be the best positioned post the industry shakedown
due to cost/capex cutting capability, strong balance sheets, managements'
focus on core activities and improving '02 returns on capital
despite a revenue growth slowdown.

Wireline Services B. Bath, .202.452.4732
Industry Capex Cuts, Better Focus Yield Better Returns
*We are reducing our capex expectations for the Telecom carriers given
continued weakness in commercial Data demand and more
focused industry spending. We are reducing our total industry capital
spending forecast in '01 and '02 by $1.2B and $9.2B,
respectively, partly in anticipation of another wave of capex cuts at the
megacaps in the near-term. Despite the changes to our
revenue and EPS forecasts outlined in our companion note (""Cutting '02 RBOC
Ests; Commercial Market Slowdown Persists""), we
reiterate our view that 2001 is a year of inflection in ROE, as key
return-on-capital metrics (rev/capex, EBITDA/capex, and FCF) are
improving at a FASTER-THAN-EXPECTED rate.

CLECs 	D. Zito, .202.452.4748
Data Revisited
*A sluggish economy and slowing IT spending continue to dampen data revenue
growth projections in the sector, as we've noted in the
past.
*We currently project a modest recovery in data revenue growth in late 2002.
A further prolonged macroeconomic slump could cause
us to revisit these estimates, however.
*We project data growth to accelerate 350 bps from 17.5% in 1H02 to 21.0% in
2H02, with the second half of the year accounting for
60% of the absolute data growth forecasted for 2002.

Rank 1 1
*Updating our price target in line with our most recently published DCF
model to $61 from $90 per share. Maintaining 1 - Strong Buy
rating.
*While near term revenue growth likely to remain under pressure due to the
softer economy, curbed IT spending and related weakened
demand for bandwidth, and customer grooming efforts, TWTC remains our top
pick in the competitive provider space.
*Target applies a 13% discount rate to terminal value EBITDA margins and
growth rate of 38% and 9%, respectively.
*Our $61 EY02 price target implies a firm value to 2003 EBITDA ratio of 0.4x
'03 EBITDA growth, versus 0.8x forward EBITDA-to-growth

Mkt Cap: $19.9B EPS 2002 $0.03E -$0.08E -$0.02E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $12 $9
Rank 2 2
*We are lowering our ests & target for NT to reflect further revisions by
our telecom services team to lower once again our US capex
forecasts in 01 & 02
*As suggested today by our svc team, outlook for US carrier capex continues
to weaken (down 5-10% for '01 & 15-20% for '02).
While int'l mkts have seen more moderate decline so far, those mkts have
tended to trail US by 1-2 qtrs.
*Thus, we believe worldwide carrier capex may remain weak into '03. With
over 80% revs from carrier mkt, NT may not see sig.
growth until '03.
*Separately, we note NT may see other n-term challenges in rolling out its
next-gen products & as it reduces Enterprise exposure.
*Against challenging macro backdrop, we are moving our CY01 rev & EPS to
$19.2b & ($0.87) from $19.6b (-31%) & ($0.83). CY02
rev & EPS move to $18.1b (-6%) & ($0.08) from $20.5b (+5%) & $0.03. Target
moves to $9, or 1.5x CY02 sales ests. We currently
maintain longer-term 2 rating.

Data-networking & Wireline Equipment S. Levy, .212.526.2499
Still Searching for the Bottom
*Coincident with Lehman Brothers' telecom services analysts trimming their
2002 N. American carrier spending est, we are taking a
slightly more conservative view of our carrier spending outlook as well, and
our revenue est for Lucent and Tellabs. Most of our
telecom services analysts' capex cutbacks are based on the increasing
concern that N. American incumbent carriers are likely to
accelerate their spending contraction in 2002 and we are focusing on Lucent
and Tellabs due to their heavy concentration of sales to
incumbent N. American service providers.
*While our revenue and EPS forecasts are being modestly reduced for both
Lucent and Tellabs we are maintaining our 1-Strong Buy
ratings on those two stocks as we believe they still represent attractive
longer-term investment opportunities.

Broadband Access Technologies A. Green, .212.526.3860
Implications of Further Cap Ex Reductions
*Lehman Brother's service provider analysts are reducing their expectations
today for capital spending by North American service
providers in '01 and '02. Compared to prior expectations of capital spending
contraction of 3% in 2001 and a further 11% in 2002,
the Lehman team now looks for spending to fall 5% in 2001 and 19% in 2002.
*This is further evidence that the challenging times continue for the
providers of data communications technology, including those
companies focused on the access portion of the network.
*Below we discuss the implications of these new cap ex assumptions on the
companies in our Broadband Access Technologies
Universe with exposure to the telecom service providers - ADCT, AFCI, ORCT,
NXTV, TUTS, TSTN, and VINA.

Semiconductors & Communications A. Chanda, .415.274.5370
Telecom Far from Bottom
*We believe that the telecom components companies such as AMCC, Agere, JDS
Uniphase, PMC-Sierra and Vitesse will continue to
underperform the market as valuations remain high and business conditions
continue to weaken.
*We believe that the first two months of Q3 were weak for the telecom
components sector. In particular, we believe that although we
are through the first stage of cancellations having ended, backlog continues
to weaken.
*In addition, we do not believe that the market has reflected the
fundamentals adequately in the valuations of the component vendors.
Current valuations of the IC vendors of 10x-plus revenue multiples in C01
and C02 are unrealistic in the face of revenue growth
declining for two years for their customers and by implication, the
component vendors themselves.

by growth in basketball and continued expansion in U.S. apparel, we believe
the U.S. is on the path to recovery.
*The basketball category is making a strong resurgence at retail and Nike,
the market share leader in basketball, is benefiting from this
trend.
*Recent results from both Venator and Footstar demonstrate that athletic
specialty retailers continue to perform admirably despite the
difficult retail environment. Venator's 2Q01 comp store sales increased 7.7%
led by high double digit increases in basketball while
Footstar reported a 12.9% August comp store sales gain in its athletic
segment led by strong double digit increases in basketball as
well.

FOCUS STOCKS

Fannie Mae(FNM) 1 - Strong Buy B. Harting, .212.526.3007
Raising Our '02 Est. Based on the Law of Average Balance (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $76.21 EPS 2000 N/A $4.28 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $89 - 52 EPS 2001 $5.15E $5.15E $5.13E 14.8
Mkt Cap: $76.3B EPS 2002 $5.80E $5.85E $5.81E 13.0
FY: 12/31 Price Target $100 $100
Rank 1 1
*We are raising our '02 EPS estimate for FNM by $0.05 to $5.85. Our new
estimate represents 13.6% growth. We reiterate our 1
Strong Buy rating and $100 price target for FNM.
*The Refi Index recently surpassed the 2,000 mark and the yield curve
remains steep. In this market environment, we believe FNM
will likely continue to report strong mortgage purchase volume.
*We originally projected that FNM's retained portfolio growth in 2001 would
be front-end loaded. However, the recent refinance
trend and the fixed income market conditions make us believe that its
retained portfolio growth should continue to be strong in the
second half of the year.
*The law of average balance means that if the ending balance of the year is
X% higher than the average balance for the year, net
interest income in the following year will be higher at least by X%
(assuming a stable margin). Thus, stronger portfolio growth in the
second half of 2001 translates into higher earnings growth in 2002.

Freddie Mac(FRE) 1 - Strong Buy B. Harting, .212.526.3007
Lehman Hosted Investor Meetings; Raising Estimates (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $76.02 EPS 2000 N/A $3.40 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $70 - 41 EPS 2001 $4.15E $4.15E $4.16E 18.3
Mkt Cap: $52.8B EPS 2002 $4.70E $4.75E $4.73E 16.0
FY: 12/31 Price Target $80 $80
Rank 1 1
*Lehman Brothers hosted investor meetings with FRE management. Management
stressed that its business fundamentals are very
strong, and that the company believes both 2001 and 2002 will be excellent
years for FRE. Thus, we are raising our '01 EPS estimate
by $0.03 to $4.18 and our '02 EPS estimate by $0.05 to $4.75. We reiterate
our 1 Strong Buy rating for FRE.
*So far this year, FRE raised its guidance for its net retained portfolio
growth 3 times. Its most recent guidance was $80-$90 bil.
However, since FRE gave its current guidance, refi activities have picked
up. Further, July was another strong month for FRE with
$11 bil. of net portfolio growth.
*Although the company still maintains its official guidance at $80-$90 bil.,
we believe that FRE's net retained portfolio growth should
surpass $100 bil.
*Thus, we are raising our EPS estimates for this year and the next year.
FRE's strong retained portfolio growth in the second half of
the year should benefit FRE well into 2002.

SBC Communications(SBC) 1 - Strong Buy B. Bath, .202.452.4732
SBC - Mgmt Focus on Core, ROE, FCF (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $40.91 EPS 2000 N/A $2.26 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $59 - 38 EPS 2001 $2.35E $2.35E $2.36E 17.4
Mkt Cap: $138.9B EPS 2002 $2.58E $2.42E $2.57E 16.9
FY: 12/31 Price Target $65 $65
Rank 1 1
*We believe SBC is realigning its capital and energy on core wireline and
wireless growth drivers, with appropriately targeted
reductions in capex and improving margins. REITERATE STRONG BUY.
*SBC's non-core, low-margin initiatives are being dramatically scaled
back/eliminated. Mgmt has decreased spending on out-of-region
CLEC/DLEC, sold non-core domestic businesses (cable and security) and is
reviewing its int'l investments for sales of non-strategic
and/or low-return assets (MATAV was sold in '00 and Diax in 2001.)
*We expect Mgmt focus and decreased dilution will improve margins; we are
assuming 50 bp margin improvements and 6.4%
EBITDA & 7.8% EPS CAGRs (3 yrs). Cutting '02 EPS to $2.42 from $2.58 to
reflect a sluggish commercial market.
*Additionally, we expect Mgmt will continue to divest low-return assets and
buy back stock; these initiatives could add 150 bps to
annual EPS growth (to 9.3%) and 200-300 bps to ROE; SBC is fundamentally
undervalued at 6.2x EBITDA.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Portfolio Strategy J. Applegate, .212.526.4585
Why the Negative Wealth Effect Hasnt Happened
*One of the concerns that we hear from portfolio managers is that the U.S.
consumer, who has proved surprisingly resilient, will roll
over, taking the U.S. economy, stock market, and global equity markets with
him. We have not been in the U.S. consumer worrywart
camp, and still arent, for the reasons below.
*A balanced look at the balance sheet simply does not support the view that
U.S. households are overleveraged.
*Less Than Half of U.S. Households Own Equities; And the Wealthiest Decile
Owns 82% of the Stock Market.
*Houses, are the most important asset class for the majority of U.S.
households and their prices have been rising for most of this
cycle.
*U.S. household debt service to disposable income is at the prior 1986 peak,
mostly due to incerased home ownership.

"Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy","
The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"Meeting with Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr.","

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement

in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance

"RADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE NATION","
                      RADIO ADDRESS OF THE PRESIDENT
                               TO THE NATION




     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  This weekend I am engaged in extensive
sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a
comprehensive assault on terrorism.  This will be a different kind of
conflict against a different kind of enemy.

     This is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with
opponents who believe they are invisible.  Yet, they are mistaken.  They
will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have
learned:  Those who make war against the United States have chosen their
own destruction.  Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single
battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations
and those who harbor and support them.

     We are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country
and eradicate the evil of terrorism.  And we are determined to see this
conflict through.  Americans of every faith and background are committed to
this goal.

     Yesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and
saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance.  I met with
rescuers who have worked past exhaustion, who cheered for our country and
the great cause we have entered.

     In Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress
have shown a remarkable unity, and I'm deeply grateful.  A terrorist attack
designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation.  Over
the past few days, we have learned much about American courage -- the
courage of firefighters and police officers who suffered so great a loss,
the courage of passengers aboard United 93 who may well have fought with
the hijackers and saved many lives on the ground.

     Now we honor those who died, and prepare to respond to these attacks
on our nation.  I will not settle for a token act.  Our response must be
sweeping, sustained and effective.  We have much do to, and much to ask of
the American people.

     You will be asked for your patience; for, the conflict will not be
short.  You will be asked for resolve; for, the conflict will not be easy.
You will be asked for your strength, because the course to victory may be
long.

     In the past week, we have seen the American people at their very best
everywhere in America.  Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood,
to fly our country's flag.  Americans are coming together to share their
grief and gain strength from one another.

     Great tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that
is in our country, with courage and concern for others.  Because this is
America.  This is who we are.  This is what our enemies hate and have
attacked.  And this is why we will prevail.

     Thank you for listening.

                                 END

Subject: [smu-betas] Dent pisses on Bud Wilkinson's grave


Dear Brothers,
It was good to see everyone make the trek to central Oklahoma to launch
Dent's book.  The Daily Oklahoman published a brief story that suggested
Dent
had made up a bunch of lies about Saint Bud Wilkinson steppin out on the old
lady.  Around here, that's like saying the Pope likes it up the ass.
Needless to say, the Sooner faithful were slightly chapped and the
university
canceled their offer to host the signing party at our new museum.  Fuck 'em.
Who wants to drink beer in a dusty old museum anyway?
     Del, sorry I couldn't make the party but I did get to see Cdie,
Grumbles
, Strange, Woody, Benson, PP, and Space for dinner.  My favorite part was
the
full-volume discussion of who had the biggest penis (next to Benson, of
course).  Typical urology shit.  The family next to us failed to recognize a
medical discussion amongst professionals.  Speaking of Benson, he was
worried
that his erections might crater all of a sudden just like his near vision
has
recently done.  I assured him that this was extremely unlikely but, in his
case, he'd better hope that his cardiac output remains high or else he's
liable to pass out every time he gets a hard on.

                                                                     B.

"Thank You - NYUonline","Jeff,

Just a brief note to thank you and your team for meeting with me during your
busy trip to Boston last week.  Due to time constraints, we did not get a
chance to talk at length about NYUonline, so FYI - I thought I would email
you a brief overview of our group.

NYUonline is the ""for profit"" eLearning subsidiary of New York University,
and we are a content and technology eLearning company.  On the content side,
we work with the over 20 schools at New York University to bring their
content online for the individual school's distance learning programs and
then repurpose for our Fortune 1000, Government and other Higher Education
customers worldwide.

On the technology side, we developed one of the industry's leading Learning
Object Driven, and Scorm conformant (industry standard) Web Based
Authoring/Publishing Tool that will be released commercially in May
(""iAuthor"").  The authoring tool enables Higher Education Institutions,
Corporations and Governments to bring their content and knowledge online in
the form of ""Learning Objects"".   The tool has received very strong marks
from our colleagues in the higher education space (oxford, Stanford, uc
Berkeley, uc Irvine, Princeton, Cornell, London school of economics, etc);
as well as the corporate market.  In fact, one of the presentations we were
having in Boston was to HBS's new interactive unit, and HBS's executive
director - information technology group.

Thank you again for meeting with us, and you have an open invitation to join
us in SOHO next time you are in the nyc area to meet the rest of our team,

Augusto Failde
Senior Vice President

WHITE PAPER:
The Effective Energy Risk Management Program: Design and Implementation

CONTENTS

Foreword by Leslie Haines, Editor, Oil and Gas Investor and Joe Fisher,
Senior Editor, Energy Markets

Why To: Hedging Softens the Blow of Skyrocketing Energy Costs
By Jodi Wetsuki
In the first half of the year, it was next to impossible to pick up an
earnings statement that didn't list ""rising energy costs"" as a major
detriment to the business in question.

When To: Designing an Effective Energy Hedging Program
By R. Martin Chavez
As the derivatives markets have matured, an old debate continues to rage:
should corporations that are exposed to the price of energy hedge their
exposure?

How To: Putting Your Plan Into Action
By Raj Mahajan and Brett Holleman
This article provides guidance to those companies looking to implement an
energy risk management program.

"Strategic Supremacy endorsement","Dear Tracy and Richard,

Here is Jeff Skilling's endorsement for Strategic Supremacy:

In Strategic Supremacy, Richard D'Aveni proves to be as thorough and accomplished an historian as business strategist.  Through intriguing parallels, D'Aveni demonstrates that now, as throughout history, anticipating, creating, interfacing and re-inventing markets, while managing risk, is the ticket to leading and succeeding.

Would you please email your fax number?  I can then forward to Richard some information that contains our most recent numbers.

Thanks!  Let me know if we can help in any other way.

Best Regards!

"A few quotes for McKinsey's internal NewsNetwork?","Hello, Jeff,

I know you must be quite busy with calls for interviews following your
recent announcement that you were leaving Enron. However, I'm hoping if you
have a moment today, you could provide 2 or 3 quotes about your decision
and where you're heading next for McKinsey & Company's internal news Web
site, NewsNetwork, which has loyal readership across our Firm.  Our
upcoming deadline is tomorrow afternoon in time for our Monday, August 20
edition.  Given that we covered you once before on NN (see article below)
we believe this article would make for an important and worthy follow up.

I will take the liberty of calling you today to ensure you received this
message. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.

Warm Regards,

Wylie Goodman
Managing Editor
212-415-1316
------------------------------------------
Questions:

1. Can you elaborate more on the reason behind your decision to leave
Enron?
2. What are the most important accomplishments you feel you've achieved
during your tenure as CEO?
3. Do you have any immediate or mid-range plans for yourself personally or
professionally that you can share?
---------------------------------------------

Below is the first NewsNetwork article about your appointment to CEO:



Skilling named CEO at Enron
Dallas alum, longtime President and COO, elected CEO of the $80 billion
energy marketer.

Jeff Skilling (DA 1979-90) joined Enron in 1990, and became COO in 1996.
Under his leadership, Enron expanded its focus from natural gas pipelines
to become the largest gas and power marketer in the United States, as well
as diversifying into risk management and broadband capacity trading.
Kenneth Lay, Chair of Enron's board, told reporters, ""Jeff is a big part of
Enron's success, and is clearly ready to lead the company.""

Early in his tenure, Skilling helped the company exploit the newly
deregulated natural gas market by developing business models for efficient
trading and risk management. These became the template for the range of
commodity exchanges that now populate Enron's portfolio. McKinsey
contributed as well: Suzanne Nimocks (HO), the Enron co-DCS, says, ""We've
worked very closely with Enron and Jeff on launching many of their new
businesses: gas trading, power trading, and pulp and paper.""

After 11 years with the Firm, Skilling went to Enron well-versed in
McKinsey culture. According to Suzanne, ""Jeff has done a really fine job of
leveraging the strengths of McKinsey and replicating them at Enron. Their
associate analyst program and their personnel review process are modeled on
McKinsey's. He's been able to extract those elements that make McKinsey
special and replicate them in a corporate setting.""

Co-DCS Ron Hulme (DA) adds: ""For those of us on the CST, it is sometimes
hard to tell whether we are at Enron or back at the office. The great news
is, with Jeff's distinctive leadership, it all works brilliantly.""

Enron ranks #18 in the Fortune 500. With revenues topping $60 billion for
the first 9 months of this year, the company is on track to double 1999
results.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Re: [smu-betas] Hey Woodrow","Scrotum Face,
   Would be happy to play literary critic for a day on Amazon.com.  Have
just one more chapter to go and am enjoying it very much.  Am going to
re-read it because I'm just too slow to stay with all the names and places
in the first few chapters.  I could tell later in the book that I wasn't
paying enough attention early on to remember who was famous for what.
That's just a long way of saying my mind is finally suffering the
consequences of many, many years of brain cell destruction at the hands of
thousands and thousands of little 12 oz. red and white cans.  It's another
great book and hope it is doing well for you.  I know you worked your ass
off on it and it shows.
   I'll log on for the review after I re-read it OK?

Yours in -kai-,

PS.  Joe really does have Beta football practice twice a week at 5:30 in the

"Mourning the sudden, tragic death of WTN member, Danny Lewin...","Dear WTN Members, WTN Associates, and other WTN friends,

On behalf of the membership of the World Technology Network, I wish to
express deep, deep condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of
one of our members, Daniel C. Lewin, aged 31, who perished on 11
September on American Airlines Flight 11 as it was deliberately crashed
into the World Trade Center in New York.

Over a year ago, Danny (along with, Tom Leighton, his fellow co-founder
of Akamai Technologies) was inducted into the WTN membership as a
co-Finalist for the World Technology Award for Commerce.  All those who
are even nominated for a World Technology Award, such as yourself, are
singled out for doing work of ""the greatest likely long-term
significance.""  It is, therefore, even more tragic and non-sensical that
a person such as Danny, who so purposefully engaged in a process of
hopeful and innovative creativity, should be a victim of an act of such
purposeful negation of innocent life.

We mourn all of the victims of the constellation of tragedies that
occurred on September 11th and, in particular, we re-salute you, Mr.
Lewin.  The world will miss you.  Your life was clearly already marking
the future.   I suspect somehow it now shall do so even more.

Onward,

James P. Clark
Chairman
The World Technology Network

"Thank You!","Dear Mr. Lay & Mr. Skilling,

I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you and Enron for the $1000.00 I received.  My husband and I were devastated when our home flooded.  I was so proud to be an Enron employee when I heard that we had donated $500,000 to the flood relief fund.  But when I learned that we would be eligible for $1000 as flood victims, I could only burst into tears and thank God for working for such a humanitarian company.  I was a participant in the Fortune 500 survey last year and rated Enron as THE best place to work for! I truly believed it then and even more so now.  Thank you again for going above and beyond this employees' expectations.  We are truly grateful.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"WE DID IT AGAIN!","HEY TEAM - CONGRATULATIONS !!!  TEAM ENRON, the growing wonder of the cycling world, has done it again!!  We successfully completed another MS150.  The great weather, fabulous volunteer support, and team camaraderie made it the best ever.   I can still see those Enron jerseys whizzing by,  and it seems there was always an Enron jersey in sight both days.  The advantage for me in starting first is that within a couple of hours, I get to see all 9,000 riders as they pass by, and no matter how many years I've done this, it's still a thrill to be part of such an awesome event.
  
Thanks to Jeff Skilling, CEO of Enron Corp., for setting such a fine example for the team by riding all the way to Austin.  He is now a veteran of the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tours.  He looked really good on his new bike, wearing the infamous #1 on his helmet....and he beat his own best time into Austin with a12:00p arrival!

Other notable performances:

Mark Muller
&
Dan Leff

"The Morning Market Call - Thursday May 31st, 2001."," <<MF May 31st 2001.pdf>>

			Good Thursday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

With the markets short-term overbought, investors should not be surprised if
negative corporate news takes its toll on stocks over the next month. As we
have mentioned, the corporate confession period is a great time for
companies to lower expectations. However, investors need to be focused on
the big picture. The Federal Reserve is strongly on the side of the
investor. Additionally, with successful passage of the tax bill through
Congress, the Treasury Department will be mailing refund checks to
taxpayers, as the tax-cut is retroactive to January of this year. We believe
the economy will respond positively to this 'twin pronged' stimulation.
Investors should take advantage of any weakness in their favorite stocks. We
look forward to hearing from our readers.

Tomorrow, we look for another weak employment report for May. Overall
employment growth is expected to slip another 15,000, following a 223,000
decline in April. The unemployment rate is projected to rise a tenth to
4.6%.


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.77%. .
The 5-year is trading at 4.94%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.39 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.92 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS
Broadcasting/Radio & TV W. Meyers, .212.526.6011
Time for a Breather?
*With the stocks trading 26% higher in the face of downward revisions (since
mid-April), we believe near-term upside is limited.
During this period, forward multiples expanded from 13.8x to 16x, a level
not seen since July '00. While long-term fundamentals
remain intact, we expect shares to trade down modestly in the near-term. We
emphasize that this is not a change in our long-term
view, rather a trading call based on current multiples, visibility and
expectations.
*The RAB is expected to release April results next week and we are
projecting industry contraction in the 8-10% range. While
anecdotal evidence suggests sequential improvement in May, visibility beyond
June remains murky. Overall, we are revising our FY
2001 ad growth forecast to 1-2% and maintaining our 2002 projection of 7-8%.

Entertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009
What's Next for the Entertainment Group?
*We remain bullish on the prospects for the Entertainment sector but
anticipate a modest pull back before the stocks work higher. The
stocks have outpaced the S&P 500 by 37.4% this year as investors look ahead
to easier comparisons in 4Q and 2002.
*Several near-term positives are now factored in the stocks and investors
will face the realization that tough radio and TV comps will
continue through the third quarter. Since April 4, 2001 the S&P
Entertainment Index has risen 46.4% vs. 17.2% for the S&P 500 on
the heels of several rate cuts, settlement of the writers negotiations and
hopes for a better upfront.
*Investors looking for a dramatic pull back will likely be disappointed, and
instead we recommend taking advantage of buying
opportunities. VIAB and LMGA remain our top picks.

*For May, we expect +1-3% Comps on 0-1% traffic & +1-2% avg check; +2 1/2%
Pricing, of which about 1/2% burned off in May,
should more than offset tradedown; i.e neg mix. Slower pedestrian traffic, a
tough yr-ago & no price hikes causing the decel. May
Comps due after the market close
*FYI; last May, Comps rose 9% on a tough 5% Traffic rise. In Apr 01, Comps
+2% vs a tough 12%, but Apr '00 Traffic (+3%) was an
easier lap
*Expect rev's to rebound to >20% on less ""lumpy"" Specialty sales. Unit
opening run-rate will likely continue above the 1,100 full-yr
target. Maintain EPS view; Much lower coffee costs to drive mgns
*At 38x, with Comps Decel visible & pricing not being taken, near-term
upside is limited. Any retreat to $16-$18 - a low 30-multiple
- would more than discount the issues. Maintain 2-rating

*We cannot predict when, but we believe that a ruling will come at anytime.
Possible scenarios: 1) If the case is not completely
overturned, then a 70% chance the case will be remanded to lower court for
penalty phase, 2) 0% chance the States settle before
ruling, 3) 100% chance the States petition Supreme Court for hearing if case
partially upheld.
*Bottom-line: Unless completely overturned, there is still no easy near-term
exit for MSFT. However, we believe that MSFTs long-term
litigation position has grown stronger. Our view is that the ultimate remedy
will be to tighten the consent decree - and structural
relief will be left off the table. We harbor concerns that investors are
discounting a complete MSFT victory, and would use any
volatility from this excess litigation noise to accumulate the stock.
*MSFT will kick off the release of Office XP today. While informative, dont
expect changes to June qtr estimates of $6.4B revs and
$0.42 EPS.
*PC biz still flat, but we expect MSFT to make June ests on 1) def revs, 2)
Office XP, 3) server apps

Managed Care L. Marsh, .212.526.5315
Industry News Update: California Data and M+C Filing Delay
*We wanted to highlight data points from Cal. as well as the recent HHS
announcement to delay the filing date for M+C and possible
ramifications:
*Maxicare, a small health plan, on Friday said its Cal. subsidiary had filed
Chapter 11. The plan had 275K members, or less than 10%
of Kaiser, WLP, HNT or PHSY. We note that the co. had many operating issues,
including its lack of size, that prevented a
competitve threat.
*Also, we note some apprehension around recent unemployment claims in
California, with unemployment up to 4.8% in April. The
theory states that less jobs means disenrollment.
*Lastly, HHS head Thompson, has indicated that the required date for HMOs to
file M+C changes moves to 9/17, possibly indicating
further changes to come, though we would speculate perhaps ""buying time.""
Gaming & Lodging J. Minor, .617.342.4120
April RevPAR -2.6%, It's Darkest Before the Dawn
*Yesterday, Smith Travel Research released April lodging industry data that
reflects a 2.6% decline in RevPAR growth. Many
companies have been indicating that 2Q01 will be weaker than 1Q01, yet it's
darkest before the dawn and 2H01 should be better.
*In April, supply growth remained at 2.9%, while demand dipped to -0.8%. In
2H01 and 2002 supply growth should fall and demand
should rebound.
*The intermediate term outlook is brighter and we believe investors are
looking ahead as the lodging stocks have (and should
continue) to outperform the market as lodging fundamentals improve. Our
favorites remain Marriott, Starwood and Host Marriott.

"Moving forward: URGENT, URGENT.","Dear Ken: 
This note builds on the earlier voice mail, and a memorandum I have sent to  
you, following the Dave Dorman meeting. Given the initial ground work done by  
our team at ATT leadership level, the meeting between Jeff and David Dorman,  
we think did go as expected by us. I am sure Dave and Stewart, along with  
Jeff have shared their views of the meeting, and do feel positive about  the  
process forward. 
Our take on the meeting is as follows: 
1. Dave Dorman is open and eager to explore ways ATT and Enron could  
cooperate across the board. 
2. Dave wants to move fast, but at a pace that will work within ATT, and is  
strategically sound for both the organizations 
3. He is now looking forward to specific value propositions from  
Enron-Adventis team, which he is prepared to discuss with us. 
4. On that basis I am sure he will guide us to the most appropriate guys  
within ATT who will need to understand and act on the value propositions. 
In view of the above the real work begins now. As discussed with Dave and  
Stewart, we will further reinforce our commitment to develop, and take the  
basic proposals with ATT forward. Our team is already on the job and will  
meet with Stewart early this week. 
I did indicate to both Dave and Stewart that we will like to take the next  
steps in a most expeditious and matured fashion so that all the strategic  
possibilities to create the new bandwidth dynamics between the two companies  
could be achieved. 
Given that there were some hesitation within Enron on the out come of the  
first meeting with ATT, we committed to the last 2.5 weeks of work with a  
reduced fee structure. Now that the first major step has been successfully  
taken, we plan to work with you along our normal professional fee schedule.  
As we do want to move as fast as possible and if at any point indications are  
that the desired out come will be difficult to achieve we could stop and  
review progress. As a result, although not common, we are willing to work  
with a weekly rate, adjusted to professional fees of $75,000/week and out of  
pocket expenses. In addition of course for an engagement of this nature which  
essentially leverages our firms professional credibility and trust in the  
industry, our clients pay us on the basis of successful execution of the  
alliance formation along preset milestones.  
Given the strategic nature of this engagement, and our commitment to assist  
you with all the major Telcos, -- incumbents and new, we will welcome to  
learn from you the basic structure of a formula which Enron is most  
comfortable with; typically in other situations in my professional life, we  
have been rewarded in three stages: 
1. On signing of  the letter of intent(s) 
2. On  signing of the agreement(s) 
3. On launch of the first project (s) 
Ken, while we look forward to formalizing the above, please enure we sustain  
and if not increase the momentum gained from the first summit meeting last  
Thursday. If we do the right things, the upside is indeed huge. We of course  
should also start thinking through how to build the same kind of work  
dynamics with the other Telcos, in most we do enjoy similar professional  
trust. 
We will call you tomorrow to firm up the next 3 -4 weeks of  work --  
documentation of value propositions, actions, meetings, and decisions. 
Regards, 
Partha S Ghosh

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"The Morning Market Call - Wednesday September 19th, 2001.","
			Good Wednesday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

The market is, at this stage, only focusing on the negatives in the
marketplace. The perception that this war on terrorism will be long and
protracted - with the potential short-term impact to the economy being
deeper than prior to September 11th. However, the pace of economic spending
by the administration may hasten the end of the economic downturn. Hang in
there.

IMPACT CALLS

M&T Bank Brock Vandervliet

Upgrade to 2-Buy, Compelling Valuation 2 - Buy / $67.16 (USD)
We are upgrading MTB from 3 Market Perform to 2 Buy, based on valuation and
solid fundamental
performance. Our estimates and target price are unchanged.
Going forward, we expect MTB to generate EPS growth of 11%, significantly
better than the 8% group
overall.

Banks - Citibank Henry Chip Dickson
Citi Previews Stronger than expected 3Q
Citi Previews Stronger than expected 3Q
The September 11th Disaster is expected to reduce Citi's 3Q01 results by
$0.12-$0.14.
Citi had expected to earn $0.77 for 3Q01, $0.02 better than consensus
expectations despite a
deteriorating economy and a challenging market environment.
The sources of 3Q strength appear to be many of the Consumer businesses,
Emerging Markets, Fixed
Income and productivity gains.
Based on the guidance, a weakening economy and global turmoil, we reduced
our 2001 EPS estimate
$0.18 to $2.87 and we reduced our 2002 EPS estimate $0.05 to $3.45.
q Our rating remains 1 - Strong Buy with a $70 price target. Citi trades at,
or just below, the median Large
Cap Bank p/e based on 2002 estimated EPS despite the strength and diversity
of its franchise.


Integrated Oil - European Recommendation Downgrades Jeremy Elden
Low risk, but low recovery potential
Following last week's tragic events, we are leaving most of our price
targets unchanged. The larger
companies now look cheap in absolute terms. However, we expect equity
markets to rally even
more strongly, leaving the oil sector behind and perhaps making the current
position a long-term
relative high point for the sector as seen in 1979/80 and 1990. For now, the
sector has the
advantage of being lower risk but, once investors feel more comfortable with
the economic and
political outlook, they may move elsewhere.
Oil supply currently unaffected
Demand expected to fall
Eni and TotalFinaElf have greater exposure to Mid. East/N.Africa
Repsol YPF price target cut to E17.5 from E18.4
ENI rating cut from Strong Buy to Buy
TotalFinaElf rating cut from Buy to Market Perform
Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production Thomas R. Driscoll
Outlook-Shares in Light of Development
Recent events do not substantially change our view of intermediate-term oil
and gas fundamentals.
We remain cautious on the E&P sector overall but we are looking for
selective purchase
opportunities.
Near-term prospects are that oil prices may be higher than we previously
thought.
Weakening economic activity may hurt natural gas demand and lead to a more
prolonged natural gas
oversupply situation - and weaker natural gas prices.
E&P shares fell 1-6% on Monday and we are looking for entry points.
Both EOG Resources and Noble Affiliates appear to be more than 10% below our
estimate of fair value.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE
Beverages Michael Branca
Consistency & Predictability Uncertaiin
From an earnings stability perspective, the beverage industry will plainly
be hurt by recent events
and increasing recessionary pressure in the near-term. But, historically,
the industry has still
generated relatively consistent profit and cash flow growth -- even during
recession and slow-growth
economic environments.
Nearly all consumer products, including commercial beverages, are impacted
during such trying times.
However, the beverage industry tends to suffer less significant short-term
consumption disruptions and a
far more rapid return to normalcy. Moreover, the 3 big beverage companies
tend to suffer less as their
product portfolios are skewed to more affordable, traditional products which
could benefit from trade down
consumer behavior.
Fortunately, these companies are blessed with the virtue of consistently
generating tremendous amounts
of free cash flow -- such operating performance affords far greater
opportunities for share repurchase and
equity stock price support/resilience, especially in volatile markets.

Cosmetics; Household & Personal Care Ann Gillin Lefever
Seeking Earnings Stability
From an earnings stability perspective, the household and personal care
industry will plainly be
hurt by recent events and the increasing recessionary pressure in the near
term. However, the
industry is likely to outperform the market from an earnings growth
perspective, which has
historically led to multiple expansion above current levels.
q Among the large caps companies in our coverage, we currently prefer
Colgate for its earnings consistency,
driven by the strongest unit growth in the group. P&G is our next choice,
due both to its recent efforts to
reign in costs (and consequently improve its earnings consistency) and its
valuation relative to the other
large caps. Likewise, Clorox is currently in the cost-cutting mode. Gillette
is our least favorite as we
believe that it is most exposed to discretionary consumer spending and has
already fully priced in the
expected upside from its very focused management team.
q Notwithstanding that the large caps are most likely to benefit from an
investor flight to liquidity, we are not
inclined to chase the small caps. As we have noted in the last month, we
believe that Dial almost fully
discounts a takeout price, which we peg at roughly $16. Energizer and
Rayovac appear exposed to
consumer discretionary spending, particularly as we enter the all-important
CY Q4. Underlying
fundamentals at Playtex are still not strong enough to drive relative
earnings out performance, a key driver
of multiple expansion.

Food Andrew Lazar
Stocks Offer Earnings Stability
q From an earnings stability perspective, the packaged food industry will
plainly be hurt by recent
events and increasing recessionary pressure in the near term. But
historically, the industry has
generated relatively stable profit growth - even during recession.
q In short, the packaged food sector is generally less economically
sensitive than other sectors and, unlike
many other sectors, has not had pricing leverage for years.
q While food stocks are not inexpensive - trading at the upper end of their
historic trading range - the group
has traded at as much as a 35% relative premium during periods of slower
economic growth, suggesting
potential further relative outperformance.

NOTES FROM TODAY

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production Thomas R. Driscoll
Storage Report - Wedn. at 2PM
Storage report -- to be announced this Wednesday at 2PM.
We estimate that this week's storage report - to be announced this Wednesday
at 2PM - will be an
injection of about 85 bcf (10 bcf lower than our previous estimate of 95
bcf) compared to an injection of 72
bcf a year ago.
Air Conditioning Customer weighted cooling degree days for last week were 42
(10 higher than our
previous estimate of 32) compared to 62 last year and 48 normally.
We estimate that next week's storage report will show an injection of about
85 bcf compared to an injection
of 67 bcf a year ago. NOAA estimates cooling degree days of 31 versus 40
last year and 39 normally and
heating degree days of 19 versus 27 last year and 27 normally.
We expect the year-over-year storage surplus to increase from 409 bcf as of
9/7/01 to 422 bcf (estimated
injection of 85 bcf versus 72 bcf a year ago) for the week ended 9/14/01.

Oil Services & Drilling - Rowan James Crandell
Reducing Third Quarter Estimate
Rowan Companies continues to experience weak Gulf of Mexico conditions,
specifically for its
premium Gorilla jackups. We believe that Rowan will experience weak activity
levels through 2001
with a gradual resumption of higher drilling levels in 2002. We rate the
shares a 1 Strong Buy.
We are reducing our third quarter estimate to $0.22 from $0.25 in reflection
of continued weakness within
the Gulf of Mexico jackup market. New company guidance is $0.20-0.25.
q For the first two months of the quarter seven to nine rigs have
experienced downtime. Utilization for the
company four Gorilla rigs has run at 31% for the first two months of the
quarter. Other remaining jackups
in the GOM have run at 82%, but we expect this will fall to 60-65% in
September.
q Dayrates continue to be weak, falling to an average of $57,000 from
$61,000 and we believe will fall
farther.

Oil Services & Drilling - ENSCO Angeline Sedita
GOM Weak - Reducing Third Qtr. Estimate
ENSCO is a leading offshore driller with a strong presence within the Gulf
of Mexico, as well as in
the international markets. Continued weakness within the GOM has resulted in
a further reduction
in our estimates, however international markets continue to be strong. As
the stock is trading at
the lowest multiple in the group and we view 2002 as a stronger year, we
rate the shares a 1 Strong
Buy.
We are reducing our third quarter estimate to $0.40 from $0.43 and reducing
our fourth quarter estimate to
$0.25 from $0.36 in reflection of falling day rates and utilization within
the Gulf of Mexico. We are also
reducing our 2002 estimate to $1.35 from $1.99.
New contract roll-overs for the 250ft IC and 300ft IC jackups have fallen to
the mid-to-upper $20,000's from
the low-to-mid $30,000's only a month ago. We expect rates to decline even
further.
ENSCO currently has six jackups idle, but expects one to two rigs to go back
on contract over the next
week or two.

Orion Daniel Ford
Focus on the Numbers 3 - Market Perform / (USD)
ORN is the biggest power producer in New York City and the stock has
declined 22% since trading
reopened this week. Below, we provide a factual summary of market pricing
and conditions.
ORN is the biggest producer in New York City with 2,160 MW. Press reports
set last week's events as
removing 100-200 MW of load from nearly a 9,000 MW market.
NYC economics for ORN are driven largely by capacity revenue (MW available)
and energy pricing margin.
The next bi-annual capacity auction is in October and is based on trailing
demand conditions
Our capacity assumption drops from $105/kw year in 2001 vs. $85 per kw year
in 2002 and has been
conservative though is volatile (every $10/kw year is $0.13/share).

Restaurants Mitchell Speiser
FY1Q Preview/Bias Toward Upside
Expect at least in-line FY1Q EPS & above-category Comps. While Sep sales
likely to be weak on
fragile consumer spending, mgn grth should continue on lower seafood costs &
advertising rates.
Maintain 1-Strong Buy.
Expect FY1Q EPS of $0.49-$0.50, +7-9%. Bias toward Upside on steady Comps &
mgn growth. Expect
update on Sep. sales; given fragile consumer spending, softness likely.
With June/July known, expect FY1Q Comps of 2.5-3% at Red Lobster & Olive
Garden led by Pricing.
1Q/Full year Comps target; low-end of 3-5% range.
With seafood & advertising costs down 20% & 10%+, resp., this is a source of
potential upside.
Expect solid FY1Q/DRI's value positioning & nat'l awareness should drive
above category grth. At <14x,
Maintain 1-rating.

Mortgage Finance Makiko Coakley
FNM & FRE: Strong Fundamentals
We believe FNM and FRE are very well positioned in this uncertain market
environment. When
there are market disruptions, the GSEs step up to provide liquidity in the
mortgage market. The
expected increase in the refinance mortgage volume (due to lower interest
rates) should result in
higher mortgage purchase volume. At the same time, the lower interest rates
should result in
higher net interest margins. Further, their credit statistics continue to
remain solid. FNM and FRE
are still trading at less than 14 times our '02 EPS estimates, which is
below their median P/E
multiples over the last 5 years. We reiterate our 1 Strong Buy ratings for
both stocks. Our price
targets are $100 for FNM and $80 for FRE.
FNM reported its August business volume on Tuesday. While its mortgage
purchase volume came in in-line,
its net interest margin was much higher than we expected (expanded by 5 bps,
while we were
expecting a decline). Despite the margin expansion, the company kept its
guidance for its EPS in 2001
unchanged due to the fact that it is repurchasing its own debt. Debt
repurchases should enhance its
earnings growth in 2002 and beyond.

Medical Supplies & Devices - Eye David A. Gruber
Pre Announces Q3 Results
We maintain our 3-Market Perform rating on EYE given the limited visibility
on 2002 EPS and no
clear indication that the erosion in revenue has subsided.
Company pre-announces Q301 results.
Reducing 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates
Fair value for the stock is difficult to determine.

Food - General Mills Andrew Lazar
Strong Start To FY02. Maintain Buy
General Mills reported above-forecast fiscal 1Q02 operating EPS of $0.60
(excluding $0.02 of
goodwill addback) - in line with our estimate and a penny better than
Consensus.
We continue to forecast double-digit EPS growth in fiscal 2002 for GIS core
business, supported by peer
leading volume gains.
Fiscal 1Q volume improved 5%driven by yogurt and snacks. Cereal shipments
declined slightly resulting
from strong sell-in of new products in previous quarter, however, takeaway
rose a robust 5%.
q Given recent events, our contact phone number will be 917-689-2587. We
look very forward to
reconnecting with all of you.

Electronics Manufacturing Services - Solectron Louis Miscioscia
Meets Expectations, Challenging FY Ahead
Solectron reported in-line 4Q01 results and maintained forward guidance.
However, we are
reducing our estimates given the lack of visibility and in order to take a
more cautious approach.
For the 4Q revs came in at $3.6B, $200M above our est, and EPS hit concensus
at $0.06. For the full year
revenues were $18.7B and cash EPS of $0.78.
We are moving FY02 revs to $13.4B, down from $14.9B and well below guidance
of $16.5B-$18B. Our
new EPS est is $0.30 from our prior $0.57.
Our reason for being below the revenue and EPS guidance of $0.60-$0.65 is
due to the concern that the
end markets will take longer to bounce back, especially those in the comm
areas, and we want to remain
conservative on sequential growth.

Business & Professional Services Jeffrey Kessler
Cendant to Offset Airline Traffic Drop
The market's immediate response has hit Cendant's stock by xx%, due mainly
to its increasing
exposure to the travel sector. While we may have to lower our estimates a
few cents, there are
several factors which should offset any serious downward earnings estimate
changes.
Negatives: An expected drop in airline travel should hurt earnings at
pending acquisitions Galileo and
CheapTickets, at same-store revenues in Cendant's airport-related hotels,
and eventually at Avis, when
the current auto-rental surge ends.
Positives: Over the very short term, Avis is sold out, giving it more time
to continue de-fleeting. Over 5000
of Cendant's 6000 franchised lodging units are roadside based, and are also
getting a short-term pop from
non-airline travel. Longer term, the 20%-30% surge we are seeing in new
franchise sales in both lodging
and real estate, as well as NRT's aggressive acquisition activity should
offset the same-store declines.

Paychex Inc. Adam Waldo
Expect Another on Target Quarter. 2 - Buy / $31.69 (USD)
On September 20,we expect PAYX to report F1Q02 results (for the quarter
ended August 2001). We
look for revenue of $244.3 million (up 20% year over year) and EPS of $0.19
(up 24% year over
year). Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 11AM
EST at (877) 668-3803,
no passcode. A replay will be available at (706) 645-9291, passcode is
1572439.
With a high return, low execution risk organic growth ""rollout"" strategy, a
64%(and rising)return on average
invested capital, historically low revenue and earnings volatility,a vast
addressable market opportunity
which grow 11-13% per annum and is about 15% penetrated,and a strong market
position,we believe
PAYX is one of the highest quality stocks in our Business & Professional
Services universe

Department Stores/Broadlines Jeffrey Feiner
Week 2 Retail Sales (Part 1)
q Below are the estimated sales for September, week 2 for major retailers.
q Sales for week 2 - which were obviously an anomaly given the events of
September 11 - were below to
significantly below plan for most of the retailers in our universe. The
exceptions were value-oriented
retailers. Wal-Mart, for example, experienced more-favorable results from
increased sales in food as
consumers stocked up on pantry items in reaction to the recent events.
Dollar General's comparable store
sales for the second week were slightly above plan while Costco reported
sales for the week just slightly
below plan.

Department Stores/Broadlines Jeffrey Feiner
Week 2 Retail Sales (Part 2)
q Below are the estimated sales for September, week 2 for major retailers.
q Sales for the second week of September were below to well below plan with
the exception of the discount
sector, which experienced strong sales of consumables and other items
associated with 'pantry loading.'
After falling as much as 20% at department stores, retailers in our universe
reported that sales began to
return to more normalized levels over the weekend, although sales at
mall-based retailers and those with a
large presence in the Northeast remained sluggish. Below we provide sales
commentary for several
companies in our universe.

Business & Professional Services - CTAS Adam Waldo
Quarter of Decelerating Top Line Growth
On September 19, we expect CTAS to report F1Q02 results (for the quarter
ended August 2001). We
look for revenue of $576.8 million (up 10.5% year over year) and EPS of
$0.34 (up 13% year over
year). Management will host a conference call to discuss the results at 11AM
EST at 800-946-0782,
passcode: 520860.
In F1Q02, we look for consolidated revenue growth of 10.5% (8% internally),
marking the third straight
quarter of decelerating top line gains in the slowing U.S. economy. CTAS'
two principal drivers of the
velocity of top line growth are the pace of GDP and employment growth.
Trading at 28 times our fiscal 2002 EPS of $1.49, 36 times our fiscal 2002
free cash flow forecast, and a
trailing EV/EBITDA ratio of 15 times (private market value range of 7-11),
we think CTAS is fully valued
despite a ""defensive"" 60% recurring revenue model.
With management following strategies for longer-term shareholder value
creation (nicely improving internal
unit growth, unit pricing, and capital efficiency), we would be buyers in
the low $30s.

Wireless Services John Bensche
DCEL to Sell 5 Properties to Verizon
The sale of 5 non-strategic to Verizon will de-lever the balance sheet,
putting DCEL on stronger
footing. We reiterate our 1 Strong Buy rating.
DCEL is in negotiations to sell 5 properties (AZ, CA, GA, OH, TN) to Verizon
for $550M or $480 per POP.
The proceeds will be used to pay down debt.
The company indicates that the properties under negotiation were a good fit
for VZ, and are not strategic to
AWE or Cingular. In addition, these markets are island markets that were
non-contiguous to other DCEL
properties.
The TN property is owned jointly with AWE through the American Cellular JV,
the purchase price for this
property is expected to be $202M or $697 per POP. Proceeds to DCEL will be
$101M.
We estimate that $337M will go to Dobson to pay down debt. The per POP price
for the 4 Dobson
properties (AZ, CA, GA, OH) is $406.

Postponing Management Lunch on 9/19
Postponing Management Lunch on 9/19/01.
Due to the unfortunate circumstances in New York City last week, we are
postponing the American Tower

intend to reschedule this
event as soon as possible.

Wireless Services Timothy Luke
Conference Call: 9/20 - Investigating Global Wireless Outlook
We are pleased to announce our Wireless Services and Wireless & Internet
Infrastructure analysts,
John Bensche and Tim Luke, are hosting the Lehman Brothers Global Telecom
Conference Call on
Thursday, September 20, 2001, at 10:30 a.m. Following a series of checks, we
are reviewing the
outlook for global wireless capital expenditures, subscriber growth, and
handset volumes in 2002.
Upon extensive carrier by carrier checks, we believe infrastructure
investments by global wireless carriers
are likely to be flat to down in 2002, reflecting more modest spending
growth in Europe and lower capex
growth in Asia, the U.S., and Latin America.
As a result of this revised outlook, we recently trimmed our estimates for
leading wireless equipment
vendors ERICY ($3.50) & NOK ($15.22), following recent revisions to MOT
($15.45). We believe the
stocks already reflect much of the challenging outlook but with few near
term catalysts, we remain cautious
on the equipment group. The CDMA market continues to outpace growth of
industry. We are maintaining
our 3 Market Perform ratings on Motorola and Ericsson and our 2 Buy rating
on Nokia. Our preferred
defensive names remain CDMA innovator QCOM ($46.37) and applications play
Comverse ($22.67), both
rated 1 Strong Buy.

Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.  All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.  In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.

With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.  Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.

"[smu-betas] Tailgating today.","Hey guys,

As you know today is the home opener of SMU's 2001 season and we play rival
TCU.  Beta's on campus will be tailgating on The Boulevard.  If any of you
saw us last year, we will be farther north than that, closer to the turn at
the top.

Sorry for the vague description, hopefully next week we'll have a map up
(along with the rest of the alumni site) on http://www.smu.edu/~beta

Come find us and have a burger and a beer if you're planning on going to the
game.

"Re: [smu-betas] SETI via eWooglin","
Ok Drow,
BO&BM
You will note that I haven't responded to all the Beta replies cause I
didn't need to talk to bros.  They needed to talk to each other ( I shoulda
been a counselor).
My whiny ass plea was a service response to another brother, who loves you
very much BTW,  and will go unnamed (to avoid your venomous attacks).  He
thought that perhaps eWooglin was busted and we were running a test.

The test worked.  The bros are talking again.
Including you, you big shit, so cut me some slack.

But if you're feeling lonely and blue.... just reach out and send email.
Or come down to Austin and we'll cuddle.

Shacklepuss,
    I made the grave error of not checking my email for the past three days
and then pull it up only to find about 4,000 Beta replies to your whiny ass
plea for somebody to talk to.  My theory is you were just feeling very
lonely and blue, and missed some serious homosexual overtures from the
bros.
  Well, it worked.....will have to remember that the next time I'm feeling
lonely and blue.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

PS. Chuckles, can't BELIEVE you actually put your brother's address and
phone number on the website.  If any of these gorillas actually show up and
scratch one of his precious autos or spray paint one of his fricking Van
Gogh's,  he'll just shit!!

"RE: [smu-betas] SETI via eWooglin","Do I see another re-enactment of the (in)famous eWooglin dorg?  Maybe an all
new version of the ""weakest link"" (aka The Shep)in the making for prime time
TV.  Like Bro Storhtz I will be thinking of you home comers (does this make
you homies?), just not from Palm Springs - Howard Cunningham and I will be
attending an ACE Hardware convention in beautiful KC!  Speaking of Storhtz,
I received an e-mail from him recently.  He thinks we were on opposite ends
of the political spectrum while at SMU.  Can you believe that shit?
Whatever.....
This web site stuff is great.  I have been ""listening"" to all this banter.
It takes me back to days of youth.......and my Beta days.  My daughter is a
first year student (I hope she still is - that is where I send the checks)
at SMU & Wheeler & I have seen Drow, Grumps, Mule and some others recently
on our trips to Dallas.
Hope everyone has a great homecoming - wish Wheeler & I could be there.  We
have a special invitation for all Betas.  Our company will be having our
annual Christmas party on December 8th in Okemah, and we are inviting you.
Now, before you hurt yourself laughing, check out the band; Red Dirt
Rangers.  This party will rival the Studio Club and Texas Rose!  Check out
their web site www.reddirtrangers.com.  Lodging is available for all comers
We hope you can make it.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

john@pgsenergy.com

 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania - October 10, 2001 - PGS Energy Training
announced today the official release of its innovative new training product
Seminars-on-Demand (version 2.1) for the energy and electric power
industries.

Seminars-on-Demand is a completely new way to train employees in the
critical subject areas of energy derivatives, electricity trading, and
proper
deal structuring techniques. It eliminates the time and distance constraints
that frequently preclude live classroom training and enables employees to
increase their value in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner.
http://www.seminars-on-demand.com/whatis.html

""In today's marketplace, a well-trained staff is a firm's most powerful
strategic weapon. This new product finally allows a company to deliver
training across the entire organization in a cost-effective and timely
manner"", said PGS Energy Training CEO John Adamiak.

Seminars-on-Demand works by combining an innovative CD-ROM
seminar presentation with a matching instructional manual and phone-based
instructor/student interaction.  Two-week, annual and unlimited corporate
enterprise licenses are available.

Free Preview CDs are available by calling 412-279-9298, visiting
www.seminars-on-demand.com, or by visiting the PGS Energy Training
booth at PowerMart in Houston next week.

Established in 1990, PGS Energy Training delivers in-depth training programs
in energy derivatives, electricity trading and gas-to-electricity arbitrage.
In addition to its new Seminars-on-Demand CD-ROM based training, PGS
Energy Training offers on-site classroom programs, open registration public
seminars and confidential training for senior executives.

"Macerich Conferences","Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	Macerich Conferences


Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially ""Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy"").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our ""e-Business Transformation"" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our ""Value
Network"" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.

The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.

We  offer a divine medley of colorful bouquets, preserved designs  and even bulb kits paying tribute to fall.   Our Williamsburg  Bouquet  (shown right) is a stunning assortment of terra cotta  colored roses, golden Peruvian lilies, russet hypericum berries  and unusual velvety orange coxcomb. It truly recreates the look  of the pedigreed blooms found in the historical manor homes of  Virginia. The exceptional crackle-finish footed urn in which it  is displayed is adapted from those in the European market circa  1800.    Our sweet Rose  Spice Wreath  brings a concentration of fall color to a small  area while our Golden  Harvest Roses  proclaim the season in a riotous display. Combining  ruffled yellow roses with flaming orange roses it's a wonderful  choice for any occasion   We're pleased to introduce our new Ranunculus  Bulb Kit . This sophisticated flower is well known for its  dense, round heads of distinctive crepe paper-like petals and  has been noted by many trend watchers for its growing popularity.  Our kit is a unique take on these blooms and makes a perfect gift,  especially for those with children.   We invite you to visit our Sale page for limited-time offers  & our Birthdays   page for darling gift-giving ideas.    Calyx  & Corolla   	[IMAGE]

"My Resignation, and a Question","Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Jay

"well....","
I can't imagine the volume of fan mail on your exit, so I'll be brief. 
Just returned from an unplugged vacation to read the surprising/intriguing news.  3 comments: 
1.  The Times tells me you're engaged.  A thousand blessings on your heads.  (I always wished I were Jewish but couldn't qualify on taste or IQ).
2.  I've told people that  you are my business hero for several years now.  It seems a little unfair that you would now vie for the ""personal life"" hero as well, so I'll hold that title in abeyance for the moment. It goes without saying that if there were ever any way to work together, the firm (not that firm) and I would be honored.
3.  On the trip back, I've been reading Katharine Graham's autobiography.   Apparently, she slept a lot with Adlai Stevenson, another wicked smart guy.  His most widely used quote at ""retirement"":
""I'd just like to lie under a tree with a glass of wine and watch people dance."" 
They say he was too smart to be President. 
All the best.

"Tragedy Claims Life of Enron Employee","As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

"Datacentric Broadband","
Both of you met Gary Remy, the new CEO of Datacentric Broadband, at yesterday's YPO meeting.  Datacentric Broadband is a woman owned company that we invested in last year which is developing a last mile solution for wireless broadband access in smaller cities throughout the U.S.  They have done previous work for EBS including providing a link from the Doubletree Hotel to the network for one of EBS' employee meetings.  After yesterday's YPO affair they had another meeting with EBS and McCloud Cellular discussing further business relationships.  

We believe that Datacentric Broadband offers a solution that is very valuable in today's marketplace.  Any relationship that can be developed with EBS would enhance the prospects for more rapid development of the Datacentric business plan and I assume would be very beneficial to the success of EBS.  Let me know if we can do anything to move the relationship along if you agree that it is important to do so.  

Thanks for visiting with Gary and doing anything you can to help develop a stronger tie between Datacentric and Enron..

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

"Hello - From India -[Please Read]","Respected Sirs:

This is Xafira Mendonsa, one of the nominees to your round table held on November 14, 2000. 

Just felt like writing these few lines telling you that - It was great being with you in Houston. Thanks so much for giving us the chance to work for your Company in India. It is really very depressing to see things going bad, but I love and treasure Enron very much and along with Enron you will always be remembered by each one of us. I have worked for this Company for 7 long years and it has been a home for me and for my family as my husband and son also work in the same project. How I wish this project would go on and on and I could retire in the same company.  

Unfortunately things are not rosy here anymore. However, I am opted to accept new challenges and jobs across the Enron Corp. world-wide - if given an opportunity. Here in Mumbai, I have been recently promoted from an Executibe Secretary to an Administration Officer. I request you to keep me in mind and give me a chance to serve the Company anywere outside India.

Once again, I thank Enron for treating its employees so well and making us all feel important and wanted. I am proud to be associated with Enron and it is for that reason that I want to work for you till I retire.

Do consider my humble request and will be anxiously waiting for a reply. Greetings and many thanks from India.

Best regards with Blessings from the Almightly,
Xafira

"The Grubman.","Jeff, I wouldn't be too concerned about calling you-know-who an asshole.  I don't think it hurt ""W"" too much, and it gave us all something to talk and/or chuckle about.  I am very fond of using it myself, but my favorites are ""dickhead"" and ""dickbrain.""  In fact, I used them so frequently that my husband urged me to use a Spanish translation, which turned out to be Ricardo Cabeza and Ricardo Sesos (pronounced ""say-sos"").  Please feel free to use those anytime you feel the urge.

Seriously, thanks for the good things that are happening at our company.  The stock is looking better, and us old folks appreciate that.  Hope you are taking time to enjoy life as well.  Are you doing the MS150 this year?  Good luck in all your endeavors.  Fondly, Peggy

"Harvard Forum - September 22, 2001","Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum
""Pathways to Success:  What it Takes to Move from Dorm Room to Board Room in Two Easy Decades""
Dinner and Discussion Club
Following upon the rousing success of the Club's first Harvard Forum ""Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence,"" the Harvard Club of Houston is conducting another Harvard Forum.  We plan to have three during the current academic year.
For those of you unfortunate enough to have missed the first Forum, the format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvard grads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from their perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves in a moderated discussion.  The panel members will be knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow Club members better than ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.
We hope that the topic we've picked for the second Forum will be captivating to recent and older alumni alike.  Our panelists will cover the spectrum of vocational experience, not all business people; and you might argue whether some even have a vocation.  Some will identify the critical factors in achieving success, while others will argue that all personal planning is an exercise in self-delusion.  We are confident that the discussion will be informative and lively.
Because of the format, only the first 40 people can be accepted.  We had to turn away people last time, so please respond promptly, as indicated below.
When:    Saturday, September 22, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person
Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084  (Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

"greetings","Hello Jeff-- I had been meaning to contact you recently but events somewhat curbed that idea. Wanted to know a couple things, first if we can continue to sent you The Desk, and second if you'd be intersted in participating on our editorial board. Not a lot of responsibility really, but, more of an on-call advisor on market or ops issues -- other members often submit commentaries for The Desk or The Risk Desk, Bandwidth Desk etc, on market issues and so on. Also, if you're on the board, we'll send you the publications for free -- anyhow, let me know. Interested to learn what your plans are--understand the pressure you publicly described from running the big E, but, all of us here and others in the market firmly believe this game would suffer a huge loss were that ""Skilling fellow"" to call energy markets ""quits"" for good. If there is anything we can do, let me know. Also attached the special edition we ran last week, in the wake of the NYC tragedy.

"PIE THROWING EPISODE, BE SAFE!","Dear Jeff,
     Heard about the pie episode today in California.  From all the press
accounts I've read, it sounds like you handled what had to be a difficult
situation admirably and, in the immediate wake such adolesence, still
managed to clearly and articulately make your case about what's been going
on out there.  Congratulations---hats off to you, Jeff. I am glad you
weren't hurt--please, Jeff, stay safe!
    Have been following the whole California situation as best I can and
have been glued to the recent hearings on the subject in D.C. via C-SPAN.
They've made a mess of it and I don't envy you having to deal with that
whole situation.
    The picture with you and Jeffrey from the Inaguration is terrific and
sits on my table at home. Thank you for your thoughtfulness and pass my
thanks along to Sherri for mailing it.  That whole trip was special and it
was an absolute joy to see Jeffrey.
    Heard wonderful reports from Sue on the trip to Mark's wedding in
Istanbul. Would have loved to have been there and I told Mark so.
    Take care of yourself, Jeff.  I'm thinking of you through all this!
                         Tom

"Re: Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request","I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.

In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record & loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.

Respectfully,

Sean Zurbrick

Sean;

Thank you for bringing your concerns to us.  We value the input of our employees, and constantly seek ways to improve the quality of our employee benefits.  After talking to some of the parties involved in this matter and reviewing our vacation policy, we find that your management acted within the scope of its responsibility and within the bounds of our vacation policy.  In addition, we find no evidence of inconsistencies and believe that you and your co-workers at Clinton have been treated equitably and fairly regarding the denial of vacation during this transition period. 

In closing, we support the decision to deny vacation requests to the Clinton employees affected by this transition.  Should you have any other questions, please do not hesitate to direct them to your management

cc:	Judy Gray/HOU/EES@EES, Ashley Kerr/HOU/EES@EES, Tim Weithman/DUB/EES@EES, Ken Brooks/DUB/EES@EES 
Subject:	Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request

I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

Sean Zurbrick

"","Mr Skilling,

I would like the opportunity to talk to you at some point to discuss your vision and goals for the Broadband
Operating System (BOS), and strategic development in general in Enron/EBS. 


Since EBS is currently focused almost exclusively on short-term tactical delivery  (which it should be), I'm not 
sure how strategic efforts like the BOS fits into those goals.   Balancing these tactical vs. strategic goals is 
becoming _very_ difficult.  Indeed, because of the current customer-specific tactical deliverables, there is 
very little strategic development going on in general in EBS.  Yet I know that BOS is still a very important  
deliverable.  

I want to make sure we're doing everything we need to do to support your goals and vision for EBS.

It would _really_ help me if I could hear a little bit more about your short/med/long term goals for the BOS, 
and perhaps some of your thoughts about EBS' technology and products in general.  Then we could discuss 
ways to properly balance the tactical and strategic efforts to achieve those goals.


---


On a different topic, I understand that you are currently thinking about potential projects for the Xcelerator. 
And I understand that you are focusing on technical products and capabilities that do not overlap the current 
& past initiatives at other business units.  I think that there are many great opportunities in that approach.

I have seen a number of very interesting product concepts from various people in Enron that 
would fit that model perfectly.  And I'm sure there are many many more.   As a sample, I've attached 
a short document  listing just a few of the technology-focused ideas that I have heard about.

I also included the idea of commercializing BOS as a stand-alone product on that list.  Perhaps this is
one way that BOS could continue developing within Enron without interfering with the current tactical focus.
Obviously, EBS would still be the primary customer for BOS no matter how it is developed.

....just a thought....


Thank you for your time.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors.

"[smu-betas] successful surgery","Dear Bros.,
    I'm happy to announce Grumps came through his angioplasty procedure
today with flying colors.  The artery in question was, in fact, 100% blocked
and they successfully unblocked it with the balloon.  Bro's Benson, Walker
and I were there to lend moral support to Linda, as was Grump's Pastor and
Associate Pastor.  Always thought God and Wooglin made for a fairly
formidable duo.
     Grumps was a different man after so many of you called and expressed
your concern, support and love.  He was indeed very much afraid, as would be
anybody, but your thoughts and well-wishes provided immeaurable morale
building at a time when he most needed it.
     Thanks again guys.  He'll be playing golf within a week.

Yours in -kai-,

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

"[smu-betas] Dent's wrath","Dear Shack,
     I appreciate your standing up for me.  Dent has always had it in for me
ever since we threw his sorry naked ass into the fecal slime of Turtle Creek
and then dumped him into the middle of the Gamma Phi house during chapter
meeting.  What really chapped him was that most of our pledge class was busy
doing the same to Mitch Baddour and Rob Bugh.  The only ones we could spare
for Dent were Wilson Jones and Steve Larash.  Even so, I think Steve stayed
in the car and let Wilson take care of Dent by himself.
     I know Doug Dyer was in my pledge class, you morons.  That allusion was
an obscure literary device known as ""sarcasm"".  If you're still confused,  I
have a fraternity brother who is also a best-selling author.  He might be
able to explain it better (if he can get the creek shit out of his ears).

We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

"Evoke Data Analysis & mapping","Jeff,

I hope the information below will be of benefit you your efforts.  Please
review and pass to the appropriate people.

The risks associated with data-intensive information technology projects are
overwhelming.  The business and IT people responsible for working with
corporate data often discover that it is poorly documented, unreliable, and
spread out among different computing environments.  Data-specific projects
like e-business, merger & acquisition-related business systems
consolidation, data warehousing, customer relationship management, supply
chain management, business intelligence, etc often fall short of the
benefits they were designed to provide.

In addition:

""The amount of data that most organizations have created and the
inconsistencies that exist in that data make it more of a liability than an
asset.""    The Gartner Group

""Only 17% of corporate projects that require integration, migration or
consolidation of data succeed.  83% of these initiatives either over run or
fail.  The key reason being a lack of understanding of the source data.""
The Standish Group

Evoke Software's AXIO product suite enables companies to accelerate and
enhance their business initiatives and deployments of new applications. AXIO
automates the analysis of corporate data residing in disparate systems
across the enterprise. It discovers data relationships and dependencies and
identifies data quality issues, inconsistencies between different systems
housing similar information, and incompatibilities between data sources and
target systems. The results of this process-accurate metadata about existing
systems-are stored in the Evoke Repository and are used to develop accurate
maps and transformation specifications that drive subsequent extract,
transform and load or application integration processes.
AXIO sometimes gets confused with data cleansing and ETL Tools.  Evoke's
products do not move or cleanse your data.   We provide the ground-zero
analysis of data from any source to ensure the success of your data-specific
projects and avoid costly re-work of data issues.

The attached document explains the business reasons why companies like IBM,
AT&T, Agilent and Kraft utilize our technology to reduce risk and increase
time to market of their enterprise projects.  Please review the document at
your leisure.  If you should have any questions please call me at (972)
383-1220.

Dear Jeffrey,

I meant what I said about you showing a great deal of character to talk to
what was in the best of conditions  an "" unfriendly "" crowd. You could have
stayed in Texas, or not made public a public appearance. Either way you
didn't have to make the effort.


 I am sure you have given your presentation a great deal of thought. If
could I  offer a suggestion.
 You correctly identified the ugly side of human nature which needs someone
to blame. No one has a problem blaming the regulators but there is still
this outstanding question who is profiting. If sales of power have gone from
7bln in 99, 27bln in 2000 and 50bln in 01. Who is profiting?  The cost of
generation has not risen this much, so someone is making a large profit. You
alluded to municipal power generators but the more specific you can be,
break it down etc, the more believable it will be that Enron is not an evil
energy company pocketing Californians money.

 Secondly, Enron has a great opportunity to be visible in promoting
alternative sources, and or mass transportation improvements. To set an
agenda for the country that is responsible and progressive.


Sincerely

Tim Cook
Managing Director

"Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"Microsoft CEO Summit Follow-up","It was nice to see you on the panel.  As promised at the Summit, under
separate mail I have sent the Korn/Ferry brochure, ""What Do Employees Really
Want?  The Perception vs. The Reality.""

As I also mentioned to you, Siemens is in the process of targeting Enron as
one of the top 20 key accounts in the country. We envision you as a
trendsetter as well as a high-potential customer.  I hope to be able to call
on you if we need top level feedback or run into unforeseen barriers in our
attempt to be a premiere supplier to you.

"Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum REMINDER","Space is still available for the upcoming Harvard Forum.  If you would like to attend, please make your reservations today.  In case you did not receive the invitation, please see the information below.

""Pathways to Success:  What it Takes to Move from Dorm Room to Board Room in Two Easy Decades"" - Dinner and Discussion  Club
Following upon the rousing success of the Club's first Harvard Forum ""Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence,"" the Harvard Club of Houston is conducting another Harvard Forum.  We plan to have three during the current academic year.
For those of you unfortunate enough to have missed the first Forum, the format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvard grads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from their perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves in a moderated discussion.  The panel members will be knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow Club members better than ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.
We hope that the topic we've picked for the second Forum will be captivating to recent and older alumni alike.  Our panelists will cover the spectrum of vocational experience, not all business people; and you might argue whether some even have a vocation.  Some will identify the critical factors in achieving success, while others will argue that all personal planning is an exercise in self-delusion.  We are confident that the discussion will be informative and lively.
Because of the format, only the first 40 people can be accepted.  We had to turn away people last time, so please respond promptly, as indicated below.
When:    Saturday, September 22, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person
Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084  (Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)
For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or 713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or 713-665-4218).

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

"Luminant","
Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

I will miss your leadership here at Enron.  I have certainly enjoyed our interactions over the past couple years.  I thank you for the time you took to listen to my ideas, and I appreciate the good counsel I received from you on several occasions.  I hope that our paths cross often in the future.  Best regards.

Subject:	Organizational Announcement


It is with regret that I have to announce that Jeff Skilling is leaving Enron.  Today, the Board of Directors accepted his resignation as President and CEO of Enron.  Jeff is resigning for personal reasons and his decision is voluntary.  I regret his decision, but I accept and understand it.  I have worked closely with Jeff for more than 15 years, including 11 here at Enron, and have had few, if any, professional relationships that I value more.  I am pleased to say that he has agreed to enter into a consulting arrangement with the company to advise me and the Board of Directors.
Now it's time to look forward.
With Jeff leaving, the Board has asked me to resume the responsibilities of President and CEO in addition to my role as Chairman of the Board.  I have agreed.  I want to assure you that I have never felt better about the prospects for the company.  All of you know that our stock price has suffered substantially over the last few months.  One of my top priorities will be to restore a significant amount of the stock value we have lost as soon as possible.  Our performance has never been stronger; our business model has never been more robust; our growth has never been more certain; and most importantly, we have never had a better nor deeper pool of talent throughout the company.  We have the finest organization in American business today.  Together, we will make Enron the world's leading company.
On Thursday at 10:00 a.m. Houston time, we will hold an all employee meeting at the Hyatt.  We will broadcast the meeting to our employees around the world where technically available, and I look forward to seeing many of you there.

"Prayers for America - YPO friend from INDIA","Dear Jeff,

I & my family  are deeply disturbed by the cowardly attack on America.  It
has been extremely painful to watch such acts of crime.  This is the gravest
tragedy we have come across in our lives.

America is the richest democracy in the world & India the largest.  We enjoy
freedom & no amount of terrorist act can shake our foundations.  Terrorism
is the biggest danger to humanity & let us bravely fight to end these
barbaric acts.

Like America, India has been suffering cross border terrorism for more than
2 decades.  Along with you, we feel & suffer from such brutal pains &
sorrows.  Our arms reach out for all the families who were victims of this
dastardly attack.

I sincerely hope your family, friends & colleagues are safe & are recovering
from their worst nightmare.  In the true spirit of YPOer, we all pray to
give you, your family & America strength to bear the loss of fellow
citizens.

Today, all of us at home & office stood in silent homage.

With sympathy & warm regards,

Rev. Lawson would like to thank you for extending to him the invitation to

New York.  Unfortunately, he will not be able to attend the event, and the

rejoices with this esteemed honor and will continue to keep his friend in

Subject:	Endorsement Approval


Dear Ms. Patrick,

Thank you very much for providing an endorsement for Expectations Investing
by Al Rappaport and Michael Mauboussin. We really appreciate receiving Mr.
Skilling's thoughtful comments. We will plan to use the comments on the book
jacket, the front page, or in some cases, in other promotional materials.

Our manuscript editor has suggested the following edit to the comments for
style consistency with the rest of the work. Could you please review the
revised endorsement below and determine if it meets with your approval?

Also, please confirm the name and title as you wish them to appear with the
endorsement:

""Expectations Investing reinvents today's investment market architecture. .
. . A valuable tool for the innovative investor.""

-Jeff Skilling, CEO, Enron Corp.


I would really appreciate it if you could please send me an email
(ekorey@hbsp.harvard.edu) or fax (617-783-7489) confirming your approval as
soon as you have reviewed the edited endorsement.  If I have not heard from
you by Monday, July 2, I will assume that the changes meet with your
approval.

Once again, many thanks for your support of Expectations Investing. I will
send you a copy of the finished book as soon as it becomes available.

Sincerely,
Erin

"Harvard/Enron Multimedia Cases","Hi Ken Louise and Jeff,

Attached are the links to the multimedia cases Harvard prepared in association with the cases recently written, excerpted from the videos they took of the 3 of you a few months ago.

I'm remotely  accessing this while travelling and have been unable to open the videos.  This is likely a function of the remote connection.  

Ken and Jeff, I'll review each of yours when I'm better able to access. I'll then  provide you my comments (if any), as you will need to sign off on the release and use of these by Harvard.

Louise, will you please review at least your portion?

Thanks!

Hi Christie,
I'm happy to send you the links to our two Enron multimedia cases.  The
written part of the cases is exactly the same as their traditional,
hard-copy counterparts; the video clips are taken from the longer Enron
video tapes we had made in January.

I'll be sending you the required paperwork for your sign-off.  (We'll also
need sign-offs from the three case protagonists--Ken, Jeff and Louise.)  In
the meantime, if you could review the cases and pass them on for Ken's,
Jeff's and Louise's approvals, that would be great.

Please feel free to contact me if the video links don't work--I've checked
them on my machine and they seen to work fine, but things sometimes get
distorted in transmission--or if you have any questions.  Thanks for all
your help, and have a great weekend!
Best,
Meg

"Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it's time to hump it","Fartie Artie Kretz, Rag-Man Stewart, Space Hosman , (and Strap Anderson was
mentioned ) !

What a day ! First of all, I want to apoligize to Kevin Stewart for not ever
getting together with you and Sandy since you moved up here. I promise to
rectify that situation in the near future. I don't know wether you consider
that good news or bad. Instigated by Space's referance to -KAI- .

As for those roll numbers , I always thought they did it alphabetically ! I
was #460 and I thought I was last in our class ( although we were first in
pledge class GPA.) Who was #459 ? After spending a week with my hand on his
shoulder I should know.

And Tocks - I never replied to your e-mail. I do still play golf, have a 5
handicap, and hope to play better than it. If you, or any Beta Bros., get to
the NY Met area in decent weather I play at a club you all would enjoy -
really tough and NO FEMALES !  I would love to see anybody that could make
it and have a little get together. Perhaps our Beta intermural team - four
players with a total handicap of 8 and we didn't win the trophy !

Hess and Woody - your info regarding our political and spiritual leadership
is well received. Hess, you can't beat yourself up over decisions you made
30 years ago. You reacted the way you reacted then and thats it. You can
only learn from it and move forward and know that your future decisions will
be better for your experiences.

On a lighter note, my third child, Scott, is a freshman  student/lacrosse
player at Washington & Lee in Virginia and is real serious about pledging
some fraternity ( not a social organization ) called Beta Theta Pi. He
doesn't want them to know that he is a triple legacy because he doesn't want
to be called "" Flounder ""  or Mr. Dorfman.  But he has already been to a
TOGA party. History does seem to repeat itself if you're not wary.

Elvis- HELLO !
                                                        Later............

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

"Passages","
Jeff,
 
Congratulations!--on  your amazing successes and your uncanny ability to make good  decisions.  I've always held you in the highest regard for being the  smartest person I ever worked with.  I'm certain it's been a tough few  weeks as you wrestled with your choice.  In a small way I can relate and if  others were willing to speak out you would find that you're far from  alone.
 
Nine years ago this  month you and I met in McKinsey's Dallas office to discuss my role with  Enron upon its acquisition of Access.  I maintained that my  employment agreement must have an escape clause to prevent me from being  transferred to Houston.  You were understandably surprised and  suggested that my career opportunities would be limited if I stayed in  Dublin.  Having recently been divorced I knew that if I left the city  where my then 14 and 15 year old sons lived with their mother I would  never be able to continue the father/sons relationship which was so  important to me.  When I met with Ken Lay a few weeks later, he too  seemed surprised that I wasn't going to join the management team in  Houston.
 
I don't know what  might have happened in my career had I not made that choice.  Perhaps  the politics in Houston would have done me in since I was truly a small  company entrepreneur.  But, when I compare myself to my then  peers, Lou, Mark, Ken and later Cliff, Andy and Kevin, I do  believe I was/am their intellectual equal.  Thus, I may have paid  an extremely high financial price for my personal choice.  Regrets?   On the contrary, my ex-wife moved away so I actually was able to raise my  sons, both of whom are doing great (One graduated from Washington University and  lives in San Francisco and the other graduates from Florida State this  December).  I also wouldn't have ended up with Sue and gained four more  kids.  I adopted the youngest--now nearly 11.  I also watched the  births of my two grandchildren and my step-son is trading emissions for  Enron.  
 
So, I react to  your decision with respect and admiration.  I really learned from Sue,  whose workaholic late husband died at 42, that life truly is too short.   We're enjoying ours and I hope you will too.  But, with only one child  left at home we're ready to move to warmer climes.  If you decide to change  the world again, even if on a smaller scale this time, and would like some help,  give me a call.  Best of luck.
 
Regards,
 
Lance

"Business Council brochure and picture directory","Mr. Skilling,

I am sending information to the printer this afternoon for our new brochure
and picture book for The Business Council.  I was wondering if we should
just list you as a Graduate member and list you as Former President & CEO of
Enron Corp. and keep the same business address and phone numbers.  Please
let me know asap.

Thanks.

"Re: [smu-betas] New member","Brothers George and Justin,
 Welcome to the Beta e-Wooglin group.Or as most people here in Houston say,
""Bienvenidos"".I was the former scholarship chairman of the Gamma Omega
chapter in'72-'73.My main contribution to the chapter was to initiate the
comparison of the semester grade point averages of the pot smokers vs. the
drinkers. There was a  spirited competition and a much awaited, well
attended Monday night meeting when the winning team was announced. It was
always close.We remain a pretty tolerant bunch as we reach our late 40's and
early 50's. The parts of my college life that I remember were excellent.
This is a fun bunch of guys and I enjoy keeping up with them.

"The Morning Market Call - Thursday June 7th, 2001."," <<MF June 7th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Thursday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Over the last few weeks, the bond market has rallied (except for today),
despite early indications that May was a relatively solid month for the
consumer. If consumer spending remains strong, the US economy is likely to
avoid a recession. With inflation under control, and the economy hopefully
emerging from the slowdown over the next few quarters, it seems that
financial assets, and in particular stocks, should perform well going
forward. While there are some sub-sectors of the economy that are in a
recession (such as manufacturing and the tech. sector), they too should
start to respond to an improvement in the overall economy. Longer term,
investors have a great opportunity to invest in stocks now.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.70%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.29%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.84%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.95 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.77 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS
Wireline Services B. Bath, .202.452.4732
Scaling DSL - RBOCs Poised to Mine Returns in '02/'03
*We expect the RBOCs to benefit from multiple expansion as returns improve
on the key growth initiative of DSL. The declining
need for fixed investment as broadband network upgrades reach completion and
rapid reductions in unit expenses as the subscriber
base scales will combine to push DSL toward positive operating cashflow in
'02 and positive FCF in '03. We believe there are strong
parallels between the multiple expansion cable experienced over the last few
years as it passed its peak investment period and the
RBOCs today.
*We believe THE DSL story of '02/'03 is one of decreasing required fixed
investment and dramatic declines in expenses-per-subscriber,
not minor fluctuations in the level of net adds each period. We expect FCF
to improve from ($3.8B) in '01 to nearly
$500M in '03.

Cable Communications Services L. Warner, .202.452.4705
Consumer Broadband - Cable vs DSL Chapter 2
*We believe consumer broadband Internet penetration rates have reached the
steepening portion of the S curve and are poised for
significant acceleration. As a result, the race for the broadband customer
remains of paramount importance for those providers
offering the service; namely the cable MSOs and the RBOCs. We are publishing
our Lehman Brothers Broadband Report Card
which provides an update on this race, the relative positioning of the
competitors, the strength and sustainability of demand, and key
trends that we see emerging which may impact the industry.

Downgrading MCH to Market Peform Rating
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $15.99 EPS 2000 N/A $1.65 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $20 - 13 EPS 2001 $0.09E -$0.25E $0.18E N/A
Mkt Cap: $1.1B EPS 2002 N/A $0.70E $1.22E 22.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $22 $17
Rank 2 3
*We are downgrading MCH from 2-Buy to 3-Market Perform due to the sharper
than expected slide in U.S. and European TiO2
demand and the deteriorating fundamental trends in the chemicals (Equistar)
and the fragrance & flavor chemical businesses.
*We reduced our FY2001 EPS estimates from $0.09/share to a loss of
$0.25/share, due to a sharper than expected downward trend for
each of MCHs businesses. Our preliminary FY2002 EPS estimate is $0.70/share.
*Our revised EPS numbers for this year and next account for the pronounced
pressure on MCHs earnings both in terms of the product
specific fundamentals and the slower macro economic environment both in the
U.S. and Europe.

Commodity Chemicals S. Vasnetsov, .212.526.3212
Trough EPS - Second Leg of the ""W"" Year
*The chemical industry is experiencing one of the worst periods in its
history. While the companies are indeed scraping the bottom of
the cycle, we believe that the forthcoming quarterly earnings this year are
going to be even worse than current expectations. Hence,
we are cutting estimates for NCX, DOW, MCH and LYO.
*While our old estimates accounted for the trough industry conditions,
higher energy costs and economic slowdown, our latest
revisions reflect the pronounced lack of demand that we see in many of the
commodity products, notably ethylene.
*The trends in recent weeks provide no signs of earnings relief for the
balance of this year. Commodity chemical earnings will remain
weak with sluggish demand and the market's anticipation of new capacity
startups over the balance of this year.

Solectron Corp(SLR) 2 - Buy L. Miscioscia, .212.526.3472
3Q01 Preview: Trimming Numbers
OLD NEW STREET P/E

Mkt Cap: $14.0B EPS 2002 $1.00E $1.00E $1.10E 22.6
FY: 8/31 Price Target $29 $29
Rank 2 2
*Solectron is scheduled to report 3Q01 results after the close on Monday,
June 18. Our checks indicate that business conditions
remain difficult with customers continuing to pushout orders, albeit at a
slower pace.
*Thus we are lowering 3Q01 revenues to $4.0B from $4.2B and EPS to $0.11
from $0.14. For 4Q01 we are moving to revenues of
$4.2B from $4.4B and EPS goes to $0.13 from $0.16. Our FY01 estimates are
now revs of $19.3B and EPS of $0.85.
*On a positive note Solectron has a significant amount of cash to pursue
acquisitions and we believe the company will benefit long-term
from the increased amount of outsourcing. Any transaction could help offset
current weakness in the end markets and when we
finally get some stabilization in the economy Solectron's business should
rebound. Also the shares have sold off from near-term
highs, so we believe some of this bad news has been priced into the stock,
however we remain cautious near-term.

AOL Time Warner(AOL) 2 - Buy H. Becker, .212.526.1764

FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*The cable industry, including AOL's Time Warner Cable division remains
best-positioned to benefit from strong consumer demand
for broadband services.
*We are increasing our 2001 subscriber estimate for Road Runner by 11% to
1.95 million (+106% Y/Y).
*Given limited visibility into 2H01 economic conditions and the back-end
loaded nature of our forecast, we are maintaining our 2001
estimate of $40.6 billion in revenue and $11 billion in EBITDA.
*Commercial roll-out of multiple ISPs (Road Runner, AOL, Earthlink, Juno &
HSA) over TWC's pipes is expected for later this year.
*Ultimately, we believe open access will be a net positive for TWC,
resulting in both incremental subscribers and revenues.
*We think a potential rate strategy would be to brand Road Runner as a
""value"" offering at $40 and AOL as a ""premium"" service at
$50 plus per month.

Wells Fargo(WFC) 1 - Strong Buy H. Dickson, .212.526.5659

Mkt Cap: $84.8B EPS 2002 $3.25E $3.20E $3.21E 15.2
FY: 12/31 Price Target $65 $65
Rank 1 1
*WFC announced today that they will be taking a $1.13 billion (after-tax)
charge primarily due to impairment write-downs on
securities in the venture capital portfolio. We believe that this charge is
not reflective of a charge to the core businesses and we
believe that it better positions WFC to sustain strong operating
performance. We continue to rate WFC 1 - Strong Buy.
*We are reducing our 2001 estimate $0.78 to $2.10 and reducing our 2002
estimate $0.05 to $3.20. These reductions reflect the
charge and lower volatile revenue levels.
*Approx. $1.05 B (after-tax) is related to impairment write-downs due to
recent sustained declines in market value on publicly traded
and private equity securities. In 2Q00 and 4Q99, WFC recorded approx. $1B in
unrealized gains on these securities.
*Approx. $70 mm (after-tax) is related to putting the First Security auto
lease portfolio up to the WFC standard. The portfolio is now
insured.

Dover Corp(DOV) 3 - Market Perform D. Zwyer, .212.526.2008
Reiterate Cautious 3 Market Perform Rating
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $42.17 EPS 2000 N/A $2.57 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $52 - 33 EPS 2001 $1.75E $1.75E $1.87E 24.1
Mkt Cap: $8.6B EPS 2002 $2.10E $2.10E $2.40E 20.1
FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 3 3
*We reiterate our cautious 3 Market Perform rating on Dover's stock, which
trades at 20 times est. 2002 EPS of $2.10 per share. We
expect Dover's circuit board assembly and test (CBAT) and specialty
electronics components (SEC) businesses will continue to face
difficult market conditions through the rest of 2001, and the expected
rebound in 2002 will be off of a lower base than many investors
expect. We also anticipate weaker than expected results for Dover's
diversified manufacturing businesses. We note that our earnings
estimates are below Street consensus, suggesting disappointment is possible.
*Industry trends suggest that Dover's technology customer demand is
continuing to suffer from bloated inventories and a slowdown in
telecom spending. Recent reports suggest that Dover's contract equipment
manufacturer and telecom/datacom customers continue to
see weak demand.

Linens 'n Things(LIN) 1 - Strong Buy A. Rifkin, .212.526.1922
Continued Challenging Environment - Lowering Estimates
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $28.32 EPS 2000 N/A $1.60 N/A N/A

Mkt Cap: $1.2B EPS 2002 $2.15E $2.05E $2.13E 13.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $35 $35
Rank 1 1
*We are lowering our EPS estimates for 2Q, 2001 and 2002. We point out that
while sales are soft, we believe comps at Linens 'n
Things are consistent with overall retail trends for the quarter.
*In addition to the broad-based weakness in the macro environment, we
believe that recent liquidation sales at HomePlace have had a
greater negative impact on comps than previously expected, hurting LIN 2Q
comp by an estimated 1.5%. We believe business has
stabilized in the last week, with easier comparisons in June vs the month of
May. Quarter-to-date, we believe LIN comps are
trending in the (2)%-(3)% range.
*Lowering Estimates. We are lowering our 2Q est to $0.15 from $0.17, our 3Q
est to $0.48 from $0.50, and our full year 2001 est to
$1.73 from $1.78. We are also lowering our 2002 est to $2.05 from $2.15.
*Valuation. LIN shares trade at 16.4x our 2001 est of $1.73 and at a 60%
discount to BBBY---near the lowest relative valuation to
date.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Internet Infrastructure Services H. Blount, .212.526.9128
Refuting the Overcapacity Myth
*Lehman and Cushman & Wakefield have completed a proprietary study on telco
real estate (TRE) including carrier hotels and data
centers. Our conclusions:
*We believe other recent studies overstate truly available capacity. While
we have identified about 77 million sq. ft. of total capacity,
we believe only 43 million is actively available for lease. Much of the
difference is unlikely to be used as TRE and has been
incorrectly emphasized in other market studies.
*We reject the conclusion that all TRE is a commodity. Lease prices to
operators for existing TRE are holding steady in most markets.
*Barriers to entry are rising due to power, capital and location
constraints.
*Operators' customer demand remains weak, but operators like EXDS with
quality properties should benefit long-term.

Oil & Gas T. Driscoll, .212.526.3557
Exploration & Production: Injection of 117 bcf for week end 6/1
*This week's storage injection of 117 bcf was far in excess of our 90 bcf
expectation. This injection number, adjusted for weather
implies supply growth or a demand decrease of 2 bcfpd. We think demand needs
to rise 2-3 bcfpd from recent levels to balance.
There is an increasing likelihood that gas prices will fall through the
floor implied by residual fuel oil. As a result, gas could reach
the low $3/MMbtu range.

Jeff,

After your call I thought I should give you some background on Datacentric Broadband (DCB). 

1.	The company was founded by Leslie Anderson a woman entrepreneur in Conroe Texas.  Leslie continues to be the largest non institutional shareholder and is Chairman of the Board.  The president is Gary Remy, a Hispanic, whom you met recently at the YPO gathering. 

2.	DCB is in the broadband wireless access market focusing on smaller cities in Texas.  They have deployed in nine different locations and have a strategy to grow from a regional player to a national player.  The market they are in requires no license fees and is one where being first to locate in a city is critical to success.

3.	We have invested $2 million in DCB to date and brought in Redstone Investors who also invested $2 million. Redstone should continue to participate with us in any future investments we make in DCB.

4.	We have talked to Kevin Garland  to solicit interest from him, however he made it clear that DCB was not in his target market and he was not interested in the investment.

5.	DCB has engaged Arthur Andersen to help raise additional funds for continued growth.  We along with AA have been talking to other potential investors and have found a receptive yet cautious reception.

6.	About two weeks ago we were approached by representatives of Union Pacific Railroad and Norfolk Southern Railroad with a proposal to invest up to $75 million in DCB over the next five years beginning with an initial investment of $15 million.  U P asked if Enron would be willing to invest a similar amount alongside them to help DCB grow into a national broadband wireless access provider to smaller cities. After this request I asked Ken Rice if EBS would be interested in an investment in DCB either in conjunction with U P or on a stand alone basis.  My hope was that EBS would view DCB as a strategic fit to their business model and would be interested in a much closer relationship with DCB perhaps leading to a buyout. ( Although EBS and  DCB are in different businesses I know that the trading group of EBS has used DCB to provide liquidity and last mile access for many of their trades.)  Ken's response was that EBS was not interested in an investment in DCB and he didn't see a strategic fit between the two companies.  

7.	We have also talked to Lou's group, the Xcelerator, and to LJM about investments in DCB and it appears that LJM is very interested in committing funds however I don't think they will be ready in time to match U P's commitment.

8. 	At a subsequent meeting with U P we told them not to expect any additional funds from Enron other that a possible $2 to $3 million from ourselves since that is all of the capacity that we have left for this investment.  They are very disappointed that Enron does not see the strategic potential of this business the way they do, but nevertheless are still moving forward in their efforts to invest in DCB in the $75 million range.  We are currently in the due diligence process with U P and hope to wrap up a deal structure by the end of May.

	 We have solicited the support of other Enron groups all along the way while making our investment decision.  I truly believe that DCB is in a space that could be very integral to the success of EBS and had hoped that we could work together more closely, however EBS does not see a strategic fit with DCB.  We will continue to develop relationships with other strategic and financial partners in order to enhance and grow the value of our investment in DCB.

	I will be happy to talk to you further about DCB and our investment.  We will of course seek your approval for any additional investments that we make in DCB.  Please call me if you have any additional questions.

Gene

			Good Friday Afternoon - Comments From The Local
Guys!

One of the reasons that we, the Local Guys are pretty exited about the
recent rate cut by the Federal Reserves is that we think it will make a real
difference. Over the last few months, there has been considerable talk that
while capital spending (especially information technology spending) has been
budgeted by corporations for 2001, it has, to a large extent, been 'frozen'
as the economic uncertainty had taken a grip of corporate comptrollers. We
believe that this latest rate cut  (and possible future cuts), could well
spur greater corporate confidence (as well as spur greater liquidity from
the capital markets) and thus free up already allocated budgets for
corporate spending.


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.81%.
The 10-year yield is 5.30%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.81%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.03 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $5.06 p/mcf.

IMPACT CALLS

Network Associates(NETA) 2 - Buy I. Hernandez, .415.274.5395
Upgrading from Market Perform to Buy (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $9.27 EPS 2000 N/A -$0.16 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $27 - 3 EPS 2001 -$0.22E -$0.16E -$0.30E N/A
Mkt Cap: $1.3B EPS 2002 N/A N/A -$0.29E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target N/A $16
Rank 3 2
*We are upgrading Network Associates from a 3-Market Perform to a 2-Buy. We
are also establishing a 12-month price target of $16-
$18 per share using a conservative sum of parts valuation.
*Improving visibility-after yesterday's solid 1Q results, we are raising our
FY01 revenue estimates from $755 million to $763 million
and reducing our loss estimates from ($0.22) to ($0.16).
*Closing the credibility gap: results indicate that new management is
focused on delivering on expectations which should drive
multiple expansion.
*New cost cutting initiatives and new strategic sales hires in Europe & Asia
should drive NETA towards 4Q profitability and improve
2002 sales outlook.
*Sniffer product can provide upside potential to top-line numbers as
enterprises look to optimize performance of existing network
infrastructure.
*Security sector outlook remains positive.

Cable Communications Services L. Warner, .202.452.4705
Cable 1Q01 Performance Should Turn Heads
*We believe 1Q01 results for the cable industry will serve as a major
catalyst for the group by reinforcing that new services growth
remains strong despite a slowing economy. As a result, cables revenue and
cash flow projections are not only intact, but may in fact
be conservative for 2001.
*We believe each of the cable operators will deliver new services net adds
between 3Q00 and 4Q00 levels with no signs of slowing
demand.
*As a result, revenue growth for 1Q01 will accelerate from 2000 levels by
100-200 basis points and is poised for 200-500 basis points
in acceleration by 4Q01.
*Cash flow growth in 1Q01 will represent the low water mark for the year
with 2H marking significant acceleration as new services
continue to scale and high speed data breaks even

Omnicom Group(OMC) 2 - Buy K. Sullivan, .212.526.2341
1Q01 Earnings Preview
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $92.5 EPS 2000 N/A $2.40 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $98 - 68 EPS 2001 $2.78E $2.78E $2.79E 33.3
Mkt Cap: $17.5B EPS 2002 $3.25E $3.25E N/A 28.5
FY: 12/31 Price Target $95 $95
Rank 2 2
*Omnicom is due to report 1Q results on Tuesday, April 24th before the
market opens.
*We are looking for earnings of $0.50 p/s (+12.8% Y/Y) on revenue of $1.58
billion (+14.3% Y/Y). Consensus forecast is $0.51 p/s.
*We continue to believe Omnicom has the best growth prospects in the
industry based on powerful new business wins during '00 and
1Q01.
*We project organic growth of 13%-14% and modest 20 bps improvement in
operating margins.
*The primary focus will be on forward guidance as the U.S. ad market has
clearly weakened and we suspect some marketing services
are under pressure.
*OMC is up 12% over the past two weeks and now trades at 31.8x our '01 est.
We believe earnings upside will be needed to maintain
current valuation levels.

eBay, Inc(EBAY) 3 - Market Perform H. Becker, .212.526.1764
eBay Reports Solid 1Q'01 (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $49.99 EPS 2000 N/A $0.24 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $82 - 27 EPS 2001 $0.33E $0.36E $0.36E 138.9
Mkt Cap: $13.9B EPS 2002 $0.62E $0.62E $0.64E 80.6
FY: 12/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*As expected, eBay reported solid 1Q'01 results that were ahead of our
estimates.
*EPS came in at $0.11 ($0.03 better than our est which was in-line with
consensus) on revenue of $154 mm vs our estimate of $150
mm.
*Growth in key operating metrics was robust as well- gross merchandise sales
were up 72%YoY, registered users were up 135% YoY,
and auctions listed were up 66% YoY.
*We are increasing our 2001 revenue est. from $662 mm to $679 mm (up 58%
YoY) and maintaining EPS estimates for the next three
quarters.
*Despite these strong results, we continue to believe that at 136x 2001E
EPS, the risk reward of the stock is not favorable. We remain
concerned that new initiatives may struggle to take off and hold back
profitability.
*Given our concerns about growth and valuation, we are maintaining our 3
(Market Perform) rating.

INITIATING COVERAGE
KPMG Consulting(KCIN) 2 - Buy K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Initiate With 2-Buy Rating (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $16 EPS 2000 N/A $0.50 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $24 - 11 EPS 2001 N/A $0.78E N/A 20.5
Mkt Cap: $2.5B EPS 2002 N/A $0.94E N/A 17.0
FY: 6/30 Price Target N/A $21
Rank N 2
*We initiate coverage of KPMG Consulting shares with a 2-Buy rating and a
12-month price target of $21 per share, based on an
assumed multiple of 20 times our CY02 EPS estimate of $1.05 per share. KPMG
Consulting is one of the worlds largest consulting
and IT services firms and completed a $2.3 billion IPO in early February at
$18 per share.
*Yesterday after the close KPMG pre-announced in-line March quarter revenues
and headcount cuts of 5% of the workforce. We
expect EPS of 24 cents, just below current consensus of 25 cents. In our
view, these results will be viewed as a positive. Our CY01
EPS estimate of 90 cents and our CY02 estimate of $1.05 (up 16%) are
moderately below Street consensus. KPMG expects to report
after the close on May 1st.
*At $16 per share, KPMG Consulting shares trade at 18 times our CY01 EPS
estimate and 15 times our CY02 EPS estimate. In our
view this multiple is very fair but unlikely to rally near-term due to the
difficult market conditions and challenges faced by KPMG's
major alliance partners Oracle, SAP and Cisco.

FOCUS STOCKS

Nortel Networks(NT) 2 - Buy T. Luke, .212.526.4993
Weak 1Q01, Limited Visibility, Ests Lowered (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $17.45 EPS 2000 N/A $0.74 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $86 - 13 EPS 2001 $0.25E $0.05E $0.17E 349.0
Mkt Cap: $55.5B EPS 2002 $0.60E $0.50E $0.58E 34.9
FY: 12/31 Price Target $17 $17
Rank 2 2
*Post close yesterday, Nortel reported weak 1Q01 results following its
recent preannouncement. We consider NT's decision not to
provide guidance for FY01 & suggestion the usually seasonally stronger 2Q
could potentially below 1Q underlines ongoing weakness
in the service provider comm equipment market. We are once again lowering
our ests & see few n-term catalysts for shares at current
levels.
*Sales of $6.2B down 2%YoY reflected particular weakness in long haul
optical (-30% impacted by excess capacity/pricing) &
circuit switching with optical metro & wireless (+38% YoY) seeing solid
growth. US -23%, ROW +38%. Book to Bill 0.80.
*Gross margins down from 45.5% 4Q00 to 30.1% 1Q01 with n-term outlook
uncertain, announced further 5,000 job cuts now @
20,000 in total. Bal sheet broadly intact, slight QoQ decline in
receivables, inventories
*Ests Move to $0.05 in 01 & $0.50 in 02 from $0.25 & $0.60. 01 revs $27B
-11%. With shares at 35xCY02 would be more aggressive
at $12-13 range

Microsoft Corp(MSFT) 1 - Strong Buy M. Stanek, .650.289.6027
MSFT 3Q Results - A Penny Saved Is A Penny Earned (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $65.43 EPS 2000 N/A $1.70 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $83 - 40 EPS 2001 $1.78E $1.81E $1.78E 36.1
Mkt Cap: $362.4B EPS 2002 $1.87E $1.91E $2.01E 34.3
FY: 6/30 Price Target $115 $115
Rank 1 1
*MSFT beat our estimate by $200M and $0.02 with results of $6.4B and $0.44
EPS. The diff vs. our estimates was recognition of
$130M ($0.02) in deferred revs.
*Guidance for Q4 called for $6.4B and $0.42. FY02 estimates 12% topline
growth (about 2% better than expected) and 6% EPS
growth. We expect to see some operating margin pressure due to Windows XP
and XBox marketing blitzes.
*Overall the product line-up is strong, and the financial leverage to MSFT
apparent. But while unit growth still remains weak now, we
do expect a pick-up in seasonal PC shipments into the high single digit
range.
*To rationalize the current valuation, MSFT needs to get to 12-15% EPS
growth we believe they can achieve this going into the
holiday selling season. Given that the stock is up 10% in a week, and 40%
YTD, we would accumulate on weakness knowing that it
will be a slow summer.

Sun Microsystems(SUNW) 1 - Strong Buy G. Elling, .212.526.3823
Disappointing Q, with More Tough Comps Ahead (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $20.71 EPS 2000 N/A $0.51 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $65 - 13 EPS 2001 $0.48E $0.44E $0.47E 47.1
Mkt Cap: $69.5B EPS 2002 $0.60E $0.52E $0.85E 39.8
FY: 6/30 Price Target $40 $40
Rank 1 1
*Yesterday Sun reported 3Q01 results, with revs below our ests., and EPS
in-line. Sun faced a trying quarter, with a combination of
several pressures weighing in, including tough comps & weak US demand. The
quarter was disappointing, with the shorter-term
outlook still tenuous. Nonetheless, looking out to CY02, our belief is that
several catalysts can drive Sun to renewed momentum.
These include U-III portfolio of products, storage, Internet Infrastructure,
iPlanet and Cobalt-based products. While worldwide IT
spending upturn may be a few quarters away, in our view, Sun's shares are
among those to own once the cycle turns. We continue to
view Sun as well-positioned and maintain our 1-Strong Buy rating.
*Due to near term uncertainty, we are reducing our current estimates. For
4Q01, we are estimating revs to decline by 16.9% and EPS
at $0.05, down 75%, making FY01 ests.17.2% rev growth and EPS at $0.44. In
FY02, we are lowering our rev growth est. to 15.1%
and EPS est. to $0.52.

Textron Inc(TXT) 3 - Market Perform D. Zwyer, .212.526.2008
Lowers Guidance For 2001; Reports 1Q01 Results (A)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $56.76 EPS 2000 N/A $4.65 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $66 - 41 EPS 2001 $4.05E $4.05E $4.74E 14.0
Mkt Cap: $8.1B EPS 2002 $4.45E $4.45E $5.26E 12.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $48 $48
Rank 3 3
*Although 1Q01 EPS of $1.00 (vs. $1.06 a yr. ago) was above our $0.88 est.,
TXT lowered its EPS guidance for the yr. and now
expects EPS for 2001 at $4.65, flat with 2000 levels vs. its previous 5%
growth forecast. Textron expects 2Q01 EPS to be about
$1.10, down 11% from last year. We are keeping our 2001 est. at $4.05 and
maintain our cautious 3 Market Perform rating. We
believe investors are too complacent about the negative impact of the weak
economy on TXT's businesses.
*Aircraft results improved in 1Q01 vs. last yr. However this is the first
qtr. since '98 where backlog at Cessna dropped on a sequential
basis. Backlog at Bell declined for the 5th consecutive qtr. These trends
support our cautious view on the segment although the
current backlog is still quite strong.
*Automotive sales were down 19% & profits dropped 25%. Fastening Systems
sales declined 14% with profits down 19%. Results in
these segments were essentially in-line with our expectations. Textron
Financial revenues were below our expectations, but profits
were higher than our forecast.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
International Game Tech(IGT) 3 - Market Perform J. Minor, .617.342.4120

FY: 9/30 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*Yesterday, IGT reported F2Q01 EPS of $0.70 vs. $0.34 in F2Q00, $0.04 above
us and $0.05 above consensus (less than the $0.13
surprise of F1Q01). The quarter was strong, but the 2H jackpot won't be as
large as it: 1) will not have the pricing spike of 1Q, 2)
has no unit growth (vs. +43% in 1H), and, 3) has less demand from Native
Americans in California. In addition, we remain
unconvinced that cashless will accelerate replacement. With a historically
high valuation despite earnings growth deceleration, we
maintain our 3-Market Perform rating.
*Better than expected pricing was responsible for the $0.05 upside surprise.
IGT expressed comfort with the high end of consensus for
2001. We are upping our estimates to reflect the surprise and somewhat less
conservative pricing assumptions, though we forecast
pricing below the spiked level of F2Q01.
*Unit growth will no longer provide a boost to earnings, as production of
30,000 or so is flat Q/Q going forward vs. up 43% in F1H01.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $49 $49
Rank 2 2
*IDEC quarter consistent with pre-announced numbers. We are adjusting our
model to reflect delayed Zevalin launch.
*IDEC reported 1Q 2001 EPS of $0.12 per share, representing a profit of
$20.8 million. This was consistent with the numbers pre-announced
on April 12th.
*Sales for lead product Rituxan were $168 million in the 1st quarter, making
it the fourth consecutive impressive quarter for the drug.
*IDEC management confirmed that it expects to receive a Complete Review
Letter on Zevalin from the FDA in early May, and it does
not anticipate an invitation to the June advisory panel meeting. We are now
assuming Zevalin launch in 1Q 2002.
*Our EPS forecasts are at $0.52, $0.67, and $0.82 per share in the years
2001-2003, down from $0.55, $0.77 and $0.86. Our EPS
changed because of reductions in our Zevalin forecast and increases in our
expense projections.

How about, maybe near its completion,  the building guy meets the ""building girl"", fall in love and marry on top of the Enron Building.  The ""two"" (buildings) join as one and live happily ever after in Enron World.  Could be a televised promotion.

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Carl,
    That's a great idea and is one the men there are already trying to work
on.  As you might imagine, relations with the black frat are a bit raw
emotionally right now, but it's a good idea.

Thanks,
Drow

PS.  By the way, that's quite possibly the very first intelligent thing I've
ever hear you articulate in, oh, about 30 years or so.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 2nd

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

"Re: Gerald Smith","Ken said ""Tim - I hope this works out"".

From:	Tim DeSpain@ECT on 04/20/2001 02:49 PM
To:	Kenneth Lay/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jeff Skilling/Corp/Enron@ENRON

Subject:	Gerald Smith

Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about $235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

Regards,
Tim DeSpain

"East Africa","
Jeff,
 
I am Dr. Mona Yousry.  You don't know  me.  I earned my PH.D. in Mathematics in 1982 and have served in the  Telecommunications industry for 19 years.  I was recruited by Bell  Laboratories, AT&T, Ameritech, and Sempra Energy.  
 
I have always been impressed by Enron's  performance and business strategies.  I believe you were instrumental in  what Enron is all about today.
 
 
I read an article about you and your zealous interest in Africa.  You  need to meet Larry Robinson.  The following is in his words.  Please  read it.
 
Mona
 
Lawrence Robinson: Born in Congo, Central Africa, 1952.   
My father was born in Zimbabwe, Africa. My parents and grandparents were  Missionaries. My grandparents went to Africa from California in 1912 and are  both buried in Africa. I was raised in very remote areas of the Belgian Congo  and from an early age spent lots of time in the African Bush. This was a time to  learn many of the secrets necessary to survive the African bush and love it. I  had the opportunity to study and learn animal behavior in ways that most experts  only dream about. Some of my greatest memories are from times I would take a  pocket full of salt with my rifle and go into the bush for 10 days to 2 weeks at  a time, sometimes totally alone. It was also a time to learn about the African  people and their languages and cultures. As time passed and Independence swept  the Continent, I saw Zaire, the great land where I was born, turn into a blood  bath. I learned more about the most savage creature of all. As I saw men  slaughter men, women, and children, I understood better how organized and  balanced nature really is. I am a U.S. Citizen and Resident in Tanzania, East  Africa. I am tri-lingual and understand three other African languages. I have an  FAA Commercial Pilots license. Educated in Cape Town, South Africa, Singapore,  Beirut, Lebanon, Michigan, and California. Have two B.S. degrees. One in  Agriculture and one in Industrial Education. Have traveled around the world many  times. My longest overland trip was from Germany to Cape Town driving my own  Toyota Land Cruiser. This was a 10 month journey of over 30,000 miles. Crossing  the Sahara Desert and the Kalahari Desert before a GPS was available was indeed  a great adventure. From 1985 to 1992 I owned and operated my own Import Export  Company in Central Africa called ""Malaika Zaire"".  Presently I am Managing  Director and Chairman of the Board of ""Solar Universal Network"" - a Californian  Non-profit Organization, 501(c)3. Solar Universal Network is also established in  Tanzania as an International NGO since 1995. S.U.N.'s primary focus is to  establish safe, permanent, water supplies for communities in Tanzania using  alternative energy. An example of our work is at Sukenya, Northern Tanzania  where we are pumping approximately 12,000 gallons of water per day from 250 feet  deep for the Maasai Community using only Solar Energy. This system has been  operating for a year now with outstanding success. When necessary, we also use  UV Water Purification Units powered by Solar Energy to purify any contamination  which may exist in water supplies.  One of the areas we are now working in  is located in Northern Tanzania just South of the Kenya boarder and just East of  the Serengeti National Park. This is considered Maasai Land and is fascinating  country. Each year hundreds of thousands Wilderbeasts migrate south through this  area to give birth to their young in the Southern plains of the Serengeti. The  great migration is considered one of natures last unmatched marvels on earth.  This is the time when the predators like lions, leopards, cheetah, and hyena are  roaming the area. There are also heards of Cape Buffalo, Elephant, and many  types of antelope and zebra. Because of the Community Development that S.U.N.  has done in this area, we have an exceptional opportunity to hike, camp, and  hunt with the Maasai in this location. I have personally been within 10 yards of  a lion and his kill while on foot with a Maasai warrior and only a spear in  hand.  Tanzania is also the land of Mt. Kilimanjaro, Serengeti National  Park, Ngorongoro Crater, Lake Victoria, and Zanzibar  Island.

"The Morning Market Call - Tuesday May 1st, 2001."," <<MF May 1st 2001.pdf>>
			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The National Association of Purchasing Managers report for April this
morning was essentially unchanged versus March. The actual number was 43.2.
Any number below 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is still
contracting. So, while this contraction is still in effect, it does seem as
if the inventory drawdown is continuing apace, which is a positive.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.72%.
The 10-year yield is 5.28%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.83%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.85 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.70 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

*We believe UtiliCorps ownership of Aquila is not fully reflected in UCUs
stock price and is, therefore, undervalued. As a result, we
are raising our rating to Buy from Market Perform with a $41 price target.
*Based on a sum of the parts valuation we believe UtiliCorp is worth $41 per
share, suggesting a potential total return of 19%. As
such, we are raising our rating to Buy from Market Perform.
*Approximately $17 of this value is derived from the value of the companys
North American networks business, interests in United
Energy Limited and UnitedNetworks Limited and an investment in Quanta
Services, Inc. The remaining value reflects the 80%
ownership of Aquila, Inc.
*We are also using this opportunity to raise our 2001 and 2002 earnings
estimates to $2.24 from $2.15 and $2.55 from $2.35,
respectively. Our new estimates reflect the beneficial effects of a
favorable commodity environment on the wholesale energy
business.

*Forest remains one of our best investment ideas. Forest's robust earnings
outlook coupled with short-term, medium-term, and long-term
stock catalysts provide the required ingredients for investing with
confidence in the current market environment. Expected
newsflow on escitalopram next week represents the next key stock catalyst.
*On May 9 at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, new Phase 3
clinical trial data will be presented on escitalopram, Forest's
follow-on compound to blockbuster antidepressant Celexa.
*Escitalopram represents an important franchise lifecycle management tool
for Forest. Therefore, degree of differentiation for
escitalopram (vs. Celexa) remains an important swing factor in the product's
ultimate commercial success.
*Onset of action, raw efficacy, and side effect profile are the metrics that
allow for improvement with a new antidepressant. We
believe that escitalopram's faster onset of action (1 week vs. 2+ weeks)
will be a key competitive advantage.

*Yesterday's announcement of a $750 million zero-coupon convertible
financing (see our note on the issuance), will shine a spotlight
on CD's acquisition/growth strategy. We believe Cendant is actively looking
at both auto rental, as well as lodging franchises. Both
are quickly accretive.
*Cendant could opt to pay down some debt as well with its zero coupon
financing. However, the most bang for the buck will come
with buying good franchises and operations at low EBITDA multiples. While
rumors in surrounding Budget have covered the
media, we think integrating a pure play - and at a lower multiple - like
ANC's Alamo or Dollar Thriftys Dollar, might be easier and
cheaper. We also expect the company to buy another lodging name that pushes
the ""upper limit"" of its mid-range brands (like
Amerihost), as well as continuing to buy and consolidate the cottage rental
business in Europe, to feed into its timeshare exchange
system.
*Real estate franchise, flat in Q1 may be helped by better than est. results
at a comp. March existing home sales were also better than
forecast.

Banks H. Dickson, .212.526.5659
1Q01 DCF Analysis: Median Undervaluation 18% (CD)
*According to our DCF analysis, the median stock in the Lehman Brothers Bank
Universe is undervalued by 17.9%. Based on April
26, 2001 closing prices, the stocks in our universe range from being 61.4%
undervalued to 8.7% overvalued.
*We continue to expect companies in our universe to sustain very modest
perpetuity growth. Our forecast implies median after-tax
dividendable income growth of 1.6% to perpetuity, versus 2.6% last quarter.
*This forecast means revenue growth should increasingly be a differentiating
factor in bank stock valuations.

FY: 9/30 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*We see a fundamental bottom beginning to form at Lucent. The worst of y-o-y
rev declines are behind us even if the lack of growth
in front of us is still uncertain. As the largest supplier to the comm
service providers, it is going to be difficult to execute any sort of
a turnaround in a declining market.
*We have raised our CY01 and CY02 sales est and now expect $25.7 bil and
$29.1 bil, 13% growth, vs. to our previous est for $21.4
bil and $24.8 bil. We are lowering our expectations for gross margins and
now expect norm EPS of ($0.68) and $0.20 in CY01 and
CY02, compared to our prior estimates of ($0.54) and $0.11, respectively.
*We believe a bottom is more clearly forming in Lucents performance, but the
overall weakness of the telecom industry, and the
relative fragility of the company itself, make it difficult for us to change
our stance on LU shares. We continue to look for signs of
sustainability of revenues, increasing gross profitability, and further
improvements on the balance sheet before upgrading our rating.
The risk of a liquidity crisis has essentially diminished.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

I want to introduce myself to new friends and reintroduce myself to old

other things as illustrated by the following list of activities:

* Developed a web page for my business (http://www.petrostrategies.org)
* Gave presentations at meetings in Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston.
* Conducted three training classes for international oil companies held in
Orlando, Florida and Mumbai, India.
* Prepared a series of oil and gas industry training courses ranging from
one to five days.
* Taken two classes on web-based authoring and taught two statistics classes

"Leadership Subcommittee of Culture Committee","Ken/Jeff:

As part of the Culture Committee discussions, ""Leadership"" has been identified as an area of concern at Enron.  There are of course many definitions of leadership and, as such, we would like to define leadership as it applies to Enron's culture and business objectives.  As a result, we think it is important to meet with each of you to discuss your views of how ""leadership at Enron"" should be defined.  We believe the best way to achieve this end is to discuss with each of you:

1.  The criteria you used to choose Enron's current business leaders.

2.  The attributes you believe Enron's leaders should possess.

3.  Whether or not and to what extent you believe leadership impacts the bottom line at Enron?

We would prefer to have this discussion with both of you together.  But that may be an impossible task.  I will speak with each of your assistants to arrange a convenient time to discuss these issues.

Thanks

Sean

Subject: Re: [smu-betas] 76ers - it's time to hump it

Where the Hell were you guys last weekend?!  Of course, I saw only 2 of my
pledge brothers (Class of '69).  But, I saw a bunch of the brothers from the
class of '71 (whose 30th Reunion it was - mine was 2 years ago!).  I was
hoping to meet some of you jackoff idiots who I didn't know.  I thought
Chuck Paul was going to be there, but if he was I didn't get to renew -
kai -.

Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finally
met a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a book
signing before the A@M/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of ""The
Junction Boys"" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We had
a nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70's when
you were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass off
over in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a business
card, and I've been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitous
occasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you'll acept this - my
apology for not contacting you before now.  I've actually thought about it
several times before now.

So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes just
after mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys before
me haven't found it appropriate to write on this Board), I'm quite impressed
to see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -
just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of
'71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven't seen in over 25+ years -
and we picked up as if there hadn't been any time that elapsed between.
Damn, it's great to be a BETA!

Have you ever experienced problems accessing the network remotely when traveling on business or when trying to work from home on your Enron laptop?  Would you like someone to test and customize the dial-up access on your laptop before you head out of town on your next trip? 

We have identified a need and are now supplying a new service for Corp and EBS employees and it's called Ready2Go !

This new service has been established to test, modify, and update the dial-up software on your laptop.

How it works:

A calendar has been created on ITCentral at <http://itcentral.enron.com/Data/Services/Ready2Go>

Go to the site and schedule a time that is convenient for you. Then, bring your laptop to our testing site, (either at 3AC105 or EB2268D).  We will examine your system, update your software (if needed) and even customize it for the next location you will be traveling to.  We'll also provide a training session in accessing the network remotely with your laptop.

If you are interested in participating, simply access the web site and schedule an appointment.

Washington, D.C.
This year's NDA will take  Red Herring's predictive look at the biggest ideas still to come

    Thursday, April 19, 2001 Issue 26   EDITORIAL  It's been a busy few weeks  It's been a busy two weeks in the energy sector, since our last newsletter.  The Intercontinental Exchange is rumored to have made an offer for the IPE, and NYMEX has started offering new products to compete with IPE's traditional markets.  The California energy crisis continues to rack up victims with another utility declaring bankruptcy.   Conoco's refinery explosion has caused a spike in prices, and Enron and Dynergy have both reported record earnings.   As you can imagine with everything going on, we had a hard time focusing on just one issue for this edition of the Briefing.  Instead, we decided to give you a bit of everything-some e-business news with a look at what NexClear's up to; a look at online trading; and an overview of privatization efforts in Latin America.  So take a look and let us know what you think-is Latin America the next big growth spot on the energy market?  Is online energy trading going to be the thing that takes the energy sector from laggard to front-runner in e-commerce adoption?  How viable are green energies-are they the future or just a blip?  Let us know.   One final note.  Our American readers will no doubt be aware of next week's Earth Day (our non-American readers might be struck by the irony of Americans celebrating Earth Day considering some of President Bush's recent stances).  The entire Eyeforenergy team would like to wish everyone out there a happy, and environmentally friendly Earth Day (and of course take a moment to plug our upcoming Green Energy Conference in November-keep your eye out for information; and let you know about our new site we'll be launching in about 2 weeks:  www.eyeforfuelcells.com that will focus on the commercial applications of fuel cells)    --Allison Robertshaw, Editor    CASE STUDY   The Race is On   Basing its business model of its experience in wholesale energy commodity trading in the United States and OTC commodity clearing in Europe, NexClear, Inc., Boulder, Colo., is one of three known companies gunning to be the first to offer complete OTC clearing services in the United States  ""Currently, no one offers OTC clearing product there,"" says Roger Kristiansen, director of NexClear's European operations.

The offer valued at US $65 million (45 million pound) has apparently won the approval of Man Financial, the brokerage division of Man Group Plc., which holds 10 percent of the IPE. Oil giant BP is reportedly also in favor of the offer.  The offer, as presented to IPEs board, is said to comprise a combination of ICE stock, shares in the merged entity and a new second class of share. IPE's market capitalization was last valued at ?29.9m ($43m), after shares were suspended on Monday. ICE is estimated to be worth about $1.3bn.... Click here for Full Story      INSIGHT   Insight: Privatization of Latin America   The privatization of a state-owned industry is a development of historic dimension. For many Latin America nations, their formerly state owned energy companies represent their largest investment. For much of the world former global giants such as British Petroleum, British Gas, Petro Canada, Elf Aquatine (France), ENI (Italy), TOTAL (France) and Reposal (SPAIN), have recently undergone the transition from state ownership to at least partial private ownership.  Eye on the prize   With an eye on the prize that could spell billions in new investments, privatization efforts are underway everywhere from the former Soviet Union to Latin America.

"Visions of Enron"," May 26, 2001

Dear Mr. Skilling:

As part of Enron's Imagine the Future Day (4/24/01), a group of Ernonite's voluntarily got together under the tutelage of Dr Peter Bishop (Chair, Studies of the Future Program, University of Houston) to create scenarios of possible futures and their impacts on Enron. You once said, ""I guarantee that if there is one thing Enron thinks about, it is what we'll do in the future."" (ESpeak 2/29/00). With that in mind, you might find the following of interest - our ideas and thoughts about Enron and the future.  

The context created for envisioning possible futures for Enron was based upon our opinion of Enron's core capability: our ability to effectively exploit discontinuities in the marketplace. Enron has successfully exploited discontinuities created by pipeline deregulation, resulting in the creation of Enron; the Internet, resulting in electronic trading and on-line business activities/portals/exchanges; and telecom deregulation, resulting in bandwidth trading. Since Enron is so adept at this, we focused our activity specifically on identifying potential future discontinuities and their implications to Enron. These are our conclusions: 

Future: Rock Around the Clock  
Description: Anytime you want it, anywhere you want it capability to transact business/to do work. 
Discontinuity/Trends: Builds on discontinuities created by the Internet and current technology trends of convergence, increased ubiquity, wireless and miniaturization. 
Enron In This Future: Is fully and entirely networked; primary revenue generation occurs via the communication wires. Business ops ""rock around the clock"", 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Employees are fully networked and fully connected, giving employees the choice of when and where to work. Office space is no longer an issue because the employee IS the office. Employee uncertainties exist about privacy, lack of interpersonal relationships, and ""wireless chains.""
Wildcards: Major information systems disruption (global?) completely shuts down business ops; Enron wires unknowingly become 24-7-365 facility for international wire fraud and money laundering.  

Future: Not in My Region, You Don't 
Description: The return of regional protectionism and increased government interference. Globalization is seen as too overpowering, prompting regions to fight for a return of power and local sovereignty. The result is strong regional trading and political blocks that wield much influence. Their first action: restrictions on international business activities.   
Discontinuity/Trends: Contrary to discontinuities created by the fall of communism, and trends related to globalization and eroding boundaries; corresponds with current trend related to increasing numbers of regional economic unions (EU, CIS, ASEAN, Mercosur, NAFTA, etc). 
Enron In This Future: Is ordered by international authorities to dispose of non-US based assets (at a loss) and is forced to vacate foreign countries. Retrenching back into the US occurs. Enron's competition becomes increasingly intense and vicious as other multinationals retrench as well. This increased competitiveness occurs at the same time collective group/industry action is needed to counteract the action of the regional blocks, leaving Enron (and others) struggling to find a balance. 

Future: Regulation Re-run  
Description: Power and telecom re-regulation occurs. 
Discontinuities/Trends: Contradictory to current global trends toward privatization of government services; supported by social and political reaction to ""CA style"" market failures, perceived decline of competition due to provider consolidation, perceived supply issues with water, gas, oil. 
Enron In This Future: Goes ""incognito"", taking on a new identity. Governments seek to nationalize our assets. 
Wildcard: propelled and facilitated by increased regionalism and protectionism (Not in My Region, You Don't). 

Future: The Taxman Cometh - Even to Cyberspace 
Description: Internet commerce has become so big, taxing authorities can no longer resist - taxes are levied on all Internet transactions. 
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with current discussion by US and others regarding Internet taxing; corresponds with the increasing power of the Internet as a purchasing mechanism.   
Enron In This Future: All of Enron's on-line transactions are now being taxed. The volume of transactions still remains high; record keeping becomes a nightmare.
Wildcards: Tax imposed is retroactive; government cannot track flow of funds and ability to tax accurately is ineffective.

Future: Enron's New ""Corporate DNA"" 
Description: rapid advances in biotech solutions lead to trading opportunities in biological ""commodities.""
Discontinuities/Trends: Corresponds with: recent technological advancements in genome mapping and sequencing, and cloning; increased political/social discussion regarding bio-ethics; increased business/social/political discussion regarding bio-based intellectual property rights. Uncertainties exist regarding the effect of biotech on human race/evolution. 
Enron In This Future: Is the first biological commodities trader in the world. Focus is shifted from energy into the biotech realm. Move clearly positions Enron as a company of the BioTech Century. Enron structures the new bio-market and creates new types of bio-commodities paper. Biotech trading requires a new type of trader with life sciences background; Enron forms relationships with medical, nursing and other bio-based programs for recruitment. 
Wildcards: biotech terrorism; worldwide epidemics; social opposition. 

Historically, discontinuities such as these favor smaller companies because they are inherently quicker to respond. As Enron grows, we become more vulnerable to rapid market changes because it takes longer for us to ""sense"" them and to react. While none of these discontinuities is certain of course, there is merit in understanding they may occur so Enron can 
""sense'"" them and be prepared to respond early to the new opportunities they may offer. 

Of the futures this group constructed, Enron's New Corporate DNA is our most interesting and merits further ""flushing"" for details. I'm sure this group could do that well, should you be interested. There could be significant opportunity for Enron in the bio-tech trading future.

"Best Wishes","I have wanted to write you a note for several days, but you don't know me.  However, I do know how much you care about others and thought you would receive this in the context it is given.  

I am Mark Palmer's assistant and have had the fortune of seeing you ""in action,"" if only for a short time.  I wanted you to know how well-respected and admired you are ""among the troops"" and after having worked on the trading floor, your reputation is unmatched.  You are the kind of ""general"" who gets in the trenches with his troops and one that many will follow into war - without hesitation.  When you came down to personally wish Mark a happy 40th birthday, it sent a message to everyone - you were one of us and you truly cared about us.    Enron would not be Enron today without your decade of leadership.  

You've chosen the path countless others wish they had the opportunity to do - to be with your family when it matters.  It is your family who will make the chicken soup and be with you Christmas morning.  

Best wishes for a happy and healthy life.

Jody Underwood

Subject:


I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't
you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you
tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

"Talking Points - AT&T","
Attendees:

AT&T:  David Dorman,  President of AT&T (bio points below)

Enron:  Jeff Skilling, Stewart Seeligson, David Cox

Adventis: Partha Ghosh, Andy Belt and Mark Bruneau (via telephone)


Background:

As you well know, over the last 9 months EBS has made substantial efforts to establish a significant commercial relationship with AT&T.  Thus far, there have been no transactions between EBS and AT&T other than a couple dozen of circuit purchases by us mostly local loop.  Previously, our primary senior point of contact with AT&T has been Frank Ianna (President of Network Services).  It is probable that Ianna brought only the typical legacy perspective which prevented him from seeing how we could facilitate the AT&T business from a wholesale relationship.  They seemed to only want to sell us services.

Adventis advises us that Ianna now reports to David Dorman and that Dorman should be able to better understand the value that EBS can bring to further his business objectives.  It is my understanding that it will only be Dorman at the meeting (he is supposedly not bringing Ianna).  I view this meeting as a worthwhile shot to see if it is worth pursuing AT&T at all for the balance of the year for a big transaction.  Dorman's positive receptability to us is the only reason I can see to spend significant resources on AT&T in the near future.


EBS - AT&T History

Jun 2000 EES sponsored Executive Briefing with focus on EES and EBS - attendants include Frank Ianna from AT&T.

Oct 2000 - Extensive EBS team meets with extensive AT&T team to set up eight tactical and strategic working teams to find opportunities for the 		companies to build a bilateral commercial relationship.  After three weeks, results were presented to executive committee of both teams. Nothing materializes.

Potential Opportunities

AT&T currently spends a significant amount each year (expected to be in the $100s of millions) on offnet services (wholesale expenses) .  EBS would like AT&T to allocate a potion of the purchases towards EBS.

Adventis states there are currently numerous major undertakings by AT&T which are transforming the telecommunications operations at AT&T.  Is there not something EBS could do to help advance these undertakings?

At a minimum we would like AT&T to interconnect to our pooling points.


Final Note

I do not think we should lead with trading.  We should lead with our ability to provide services to the wholesale sector of the industry. The typical reaction we get from incumbent players is that if they don't trade or if they think that trading puts downward pressure on prices, then they should not do business with Enron.  They need to understand that they don't need to trade to have a valuable business relationship with  Enron

I just wanted to let you know that you will be greatly missed here.  Enron won't seem the same without you. There have been a few tears shed today, and I'll admit, a couple of them were mine.  I've personally had a blast getting to know you over the past couple of years.  I'll have an extra gin and tonic tonight in your honor.  I wish you the very best in in all your new ventures. Just don't forget us little people!

Hugs and cheers,
Sarah.

P.S.  The least you could do is come down to the 47th floor to hug the Internal Communications girls goodbye and maybe sign a poster or two before you leave!  :-)

"A note of thanks","Mr. Skilling,  
Hello! My name is Tim Ng and I was a summer analyst the last 2 summers. Last  
August, I met with you for a few minutes in your office to talk and ask for  
advice. You told me to diversify my life experiences, as that can only help  
you throughout life. Like you, with your desire to fly planes, I decided to  
take a plane to travel around the world. In the last year, I studied abroad  
in Hong Kong, traveled to places such as China, Macau, Thailand, and  
Australia. After travelling, I see how doing different things, seeing  
different things can only enhance your total life experience.  
Tomorrow, I will return to Enron as a full-time Analyst. I look forward to  
this opportunity to learn more, and challenge myself, and hopefully, do new  
and different things to diversify my experiences.  
I thank you for taking the time to meet with me last summer. It really meant  
a lot to me, and your advice has really changed the way I go about things in  
life now.  
Perhaps one day, I can meet with you again. I know that your schedule can  
only be busier now, but hopefully I can see you during your talk with the new  
Analysts sometime in the next week or so.  
Take care and I hope to hear from you soon!  
Kindest regards,  
Tim Ng

"Re: [smu-betas] Dent's wrath","Dear Brothers:

Perhaps it is my age. But I can't remember Bill Miller throwing me into any
fecal slime a mile or so from the SMU campus. But I do remember marching his
ass all the way to Oklahoma during the dorg. Next time I will dump him in
the Red River and make him sing Boomer Sooner in his pink skivvies. By the
way, I still think the Oklahoma brothers should convene Nov. 17 for the
Tech-OU game. I'll invite some Kappas to the house and perhaps we can
reenact mud-puppy. By the way, has anybody seen Singleton?

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Now, Now.  It's not MY kind of thinking that lead anywhere.  It's stupid
pledges with insufficient guidance from the leaders of the Auburn chapter
that lead to this discussion.  The Leaders of the Beta chapter should have
sent those guys packing immediately for their un-funny dress up.  But
remember when Ted Danson dressed in blackface when he was dating Whoopi
Goldberg?   The glitterati considered it poor taste and then dropped the
whole issue almost immediately.  I can't claim to know the Greek diversity
statistics at Auburn, so I don't pre-suppose that the Black Fraternity has
no whites, nor that the other national fraternities have no blacks.  I do
know that  campus life has changed considerably in 30 years, that
inter-racial dating and marriages are quite prevalent and the student bodies
and their organizations (including Greek) are reflective of those changes.
The point still remains that the Black Fraternity is as racial isolated, or
perhaps even more racially isolated, than probably any other campus
organization.  Perhaps that is why they take such offense at the Beta
stunt - maybe even more offense than the situation warranted.

"Re: [smu-betas] new members","Hey Chuck you Ol' Fart!  (After 40, we all meld together and age equally;
i.e. we're all Ol' Farts).
Anyway, it's great to hear from you and yes I remember you too!  Tell
Grumbles I said ""Hi"" and to
send me an e-mail and tell me what he's up to.  The last time I saw him was
at the House during
Homecoming about six or seven years ago.  I remember seeing Grumbles,
Foladori, Tom Duran
from the great old town of Goldthwaite, Texas, Bruce Sparling, and a hell of
a lot of the ol' gang
except most of the guys from my class and before.

Foladori just recently joined my law firm as a Partner and he has said that
he plans to be at Homecoming
along with a lot of the guys from his class ('71) since this is their 30th
reunion.  (I had mine two years ago!)
I've got my FB season tickets, my SW Airtlines reservations and and a hotel
room, and my wife Phyllis
and I will be there too.  I hope that you, Grumbles and a whole slew of the
guys I remember will be there
as well.  I f only the guys from my own class and before would get
interested and start participating, it'd be great!
I've been going to home and away FB games for years, and I never see any of
the Brothers who were there when
I was younger.  Maybe we can use this site with the help of our young Alumni
Director (Andrew McCarty) to
shame some of the old bastards to show their faces.  I will say that Carl
McCaffrey and Fred Dotts do come to the
games; but they're about the only ones I ever see.  Sadly, that holds true
for most of my friends from my class years
whether they were Betas or not.  This needs to be fixed!

-kai-
Dick Dent '69

P.S. Beek, I look forward to both seeing and meeting you and some of the
other guys from your class/es at Homecoming.

"Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock","Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr. Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

"Leadership of the Xcelerator & John Echols","Mr Skilling,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the last Executive Forum. It was very informative.  And it helped me 
to understand some of the corporate goals and issues more clearly. 

As I mentioned in that meeting,  I think the Xcelerator can be a key tool for leveraging our ""soft"" assets, as well 
as helping Enron develop new business models to lead it into the future.  I also think the Xcelerator
can play a key role in creating a balance between technology and commercial realities.  

---

To succeed in these goals,  it's obvious that the Xcelerator needs a very dynamic, strong leadership.  

I understand that a new COO has been hired and starts next week.  I think that this is a great way to introduce a good 
process & structure to the Xcelerator quickly.

I also understand that you're looking for a CEO from within Enron.  I just learned this morning that John Echols
is moving out of EBS.  I believe that John would be a fantastic person to lead the Xcelerator.  John is an extremely 
bright and creative  person, who first visualizes the overall business model, and then works dilligently to achieve it.
John is well respected within Enron, and is viewed by everyone as a ""neutral"".  He would give the Xcelerator
the internal credibility it needs to succeed.

I'm excited about the opportunity of working with the Xcelerator regardless of who becomes the CEO.
I think it will become a great asset to Enron.


Thanks again for your time.

Jeffrey,
 
Got your letter; will call you early in the week you get back from your trip with an update, unless you would find it preferable to set aside some time during your trip for a chat.  If the latter sounds better, let me know how to reach you.  If the former is your preference, let me know so I can set up a time with Sherri.
 
Enjoy you trip with Jeffrey Jr.; hope you at least find the desserts there more tasty than those flaky things they serve up out west in California.    
 
Take solace in the fact that your stature here to the east continues to grow.  Sukran's dad has found a resemblance between you and Ataturk; its apparently in the eyes and forehead (and perhaps in his imagination).   
 
Say hey to the kids and Rebecca.  Sukran sends her love
 
Yours,
 
Mark

		[IMAGE] 	
[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   Selecting the right gift or seasonal accent to adorn your home  or office is made easy with our original bouquets, orchids and  preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items has its own  character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.   Take our Orchid  Blaze Bouquet  (shown right) for example. With its fiery orange  orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal centerpiece.  This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.   The Colmanara  Orchid Plant  is quite possibly the most exciting new orchid  to be introduced in the last decade. This alluring orchid, nicknamed  ?Wildcat? is diligently sought-after for its long lasting  blooms.   Our Antiqued  Holiday Wreath  is a preserved design whose color scheme works  with most decors. It is available with our brass wreath hanger,  making it a breeze to display. And don?t forget the ideal  autumn birthday gift! The Golden  Harvest Roses  bouquet is sure to add special meaning to a  wonderful occasion.  Remember to visit Autumn  Sales  where you will find keen gifts like the Autumn  Jewel Arch  at very special prices!  Calyx  & Corolla   	[IMAGE]

Subject:  Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas



alDentiii, JaDrow:

I applaud your additions and input!  He's right, Woody.
And he doesn't need me to say that, either, but I wish I had thought of
what he added first!

The B.F. (Black Fraternity, what are the Greek letters?) holds most of the
cards in this scenario.  Therefore, whoever the intermediary is is
excruciatingly important vis-a-vis credibility with local Auburn parties as
well as the National fraternities.

Bottom line:  Can everybody (including the polka-dotted people) step
outside of their stereotypical roles for a minute and make a statement to
their unborn sons and daughters that racism of all colors ends with our
generation?  (Shocking coming from a Republican)  Or is this just another
news story, another missed opportunity?  After all, we went to SMU for the
same reason they are at Auburn now.  Most of us are or will be amused to
look back at some of the unexpected sources of the lessons learned.

Can you tell that my profession is very close to this question more often
than all of its members wish to admit?

"Houston Flood Relief Effort","
On Saturday, June 9, Tropical Storm Allison left Houston in chaos dumping more than 20 inches of rain and flooding the city in a matter of hours. As of Sunday night, 17 people had died in the storm and many others are still missing. One of those who perished in the fatal flood was one of our employees, a summer intern in ETS and student at Texas A & M University, Chad Garren. Our condolences go out to his family and co-workers. At this time, Enron Community Relations and Aggies@Enron <mailto:Aggies@Enron> are planning to establish a scholarship fund in his memory.  More information on the fund will be forthcoming.

Enron has made a corporate contribution of $500,000 to the American Red Cross to aid in the victim relief effort. Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.   Enron will match your contribution dollar for dollar and your donation will not be counted against your $15,000 annual limit.

Although Enron is supporting the American Red Cross, please feel free to make your donation to the non-profit organization of your choice that is offering aid to flood victims (they must provide proof of their 501c 3 status). Please send your check to EB1635a before Friday, June 15, and we will send it, along with a matching check to the appropriate agency.  On the memo line of your check, please make sure to write ""Houston Flood Relief.""  

We know that many Enron employees have been severely impacted by this devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. If you have been displaced because of the flood, please contact the Community Relations hotline at ext. 37181 for assistance. Also, if you would like to help your co-workers who have been displaced, an account has been set up at the Enron Federal Credit Union to accept donations. Please bring/send your contribution to the Enron Federal Credit Union and make your checks out to Employee Flood Relief .

There are many agencies in Houston in need of volunteer assistance. If you would like to volunteer, please e-mail your name and extension to communityrelations@enron.com <mailto:communityrelations@enron.com>. Please note if you are willing to lead a project.

Again, our hearts go out to Chad's family and to all of you who have been impacted by this tragedy. Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

"COX GLP 2002","Dear Jeff,

As I am back to the drawing board and start planning for the  Global
Leadership Program 2002, I would like to ask for your continuous support.
The visits this year to the  offices in London and Tokyo have received most
favorable feedback and ENRON  was mentioned several times during our GLP
symposium by both groups.  Your innovative ideas and global views has
enriched their  MBA experience.  Quoting directly from one of the students
this year:  "" ... a wonderful, life-altering program.  The trip was truly an
amazing experience, one that was both personally and academically rewarding.
Hopefully, the GLP will remain an essential part of the Cox experience for
many years to come.""

I would really apprecite the opportunity for the incoming class to visit
ENRON  in London and Tokyo during their GLP trip in May if possible.  Again,
thanks for everything and I look forward to hearing from you.

"Update - Basel Conference New York","Dear Mr Skilling,

http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2

Update on IBC's major international conference:
BASEL - MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES
31st October and 1st November 2001 - New York

We have obviously considered very carefully whether to continue with this event in the light of the recent terrible events in New York. However, as the business community appears to be trying to get back to normal as far as possible, we have decided that the conference should proceed as planned.

We therefore hope you will take this excellent opportunity to hear the industry response to the latest Basel proposals on Capital Adequacy and Risk Management, and to gain practical advice on meeting the significant business challenges that these proposals pose to the management of risk within the financial services industry.

Conference highlights include:

* A keynote address from William Rutledge, Executive Vice President, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK

* An impressive panel of leading industry speakers - visit the event website http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 for full programme details.

* Round table discussion: examining the key elements of operational risk management and control

* Outstanding networking opportunity - over 100 delegates attended our European Capital Adequacy event earlier this year

To reserve your place call +44 (0)1932 853 857, visit http://www.ibc-financial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2, or e-mail cust.serv@informa.com. Alternatively, please forward this e-mail to any colleagues from ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES CORP who may also be interested in attending.

RABIN and DARYL KELLEY, TIMES  STAFF WRITERS  The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a  preliminary inquiry into whether energy consultants advising Gov. Gray  Davis used inside information to trade stocks of power companies doing  business with the state, a source with knowledge of the matter said  Monday.  The federal agency began its review late last week, the  source said, in response to a request from California Secretary of State  Bill Jones. A Republican rival of Davis, Jones charged that stock trading  by consultants may have violated federal laws barring buying and selling  based on information not available to the public.  On Friday, top  aides to the governor disclosed that five consultants had been fired for  possible conflicts of interest between their official positions and their  personal finances. As news of the SEC inquiry spread through the capital  Monday, Davis officials were confronted by a flurry of questions about who  in the administration owns energy stocks.  Financial disclosure  records filed by the governor's spokesman, Steve Maviglio, show that he  owns between $10,000 and $100,000 in a Texas company he and his boss have  accused of making ""obscene"" profits while California has been ""on its  knees."" Maviglio said he bought the shares in Houston-based Enron Corp. in  1996.  ""It's not a crime to own energy stock,"" Maviglio  said.  He also owns 300 shares of San Jose-based Calpine Corp.,  which has the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power  contracts.  Maviglio placed the order for the stock on May 31, one  day after San Jose's mayor dropped his opposition to a controversial  Calpine plant favored by the governor and others. Under the terms of  Maviglio's purchase, the transaction was completed about three weeks later  when the stock reached $40 a share, a value of $12,000. It has since  fallen in value.  ""I viewed it as a good long-term investment,""  Maviglio said, adding that he purchased the shares for his retirement  account based on publicly available information.  The Davis  administration has spared Calpine the kind of fierce criticisms that it  has leveled at other electricity suppliers, such as Enron. But  California's grid operator has identified the company as one of many  energy merchants to overcharge the state millions of dollars.  The  fired consultants also owned shares in Calpine, ranging in value from  several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records  show.  Another top Davis administration official, legal affairs  secretary Barry Goode, disclosed in his economic interest statement that  he recently held between $100,000 and $1 million in another out-of-state  company accused of multimillion-dollar price gouging.  In a  statement, Goode said he sold his stock in Williams Co's. a month after he  began working for the governor in February. Goode said the shares were  supposed to be sold before he went on the state payroll, but his broker  failed to do so.  In light of the recent disclosures, Secretary of  State Jones said the governor must do more to ensure the public that its  interest comes first.  ""The governor should direct all of his staff  to immediately file updated conflict of interest statements that reflect  current holdings and any activity since their last statement of economic  interest was filed,"" said Jones, who is seeking the GOP nomination for  governor.  Word of the SEC's entry into California's energy problems  comes as the governor faces harsh criticism from lawmakers and others for  the quick and broad hiring of highly paid private consultants to guide him  through the crisis.  In his written request to the SEC, Jones said  that recently filed disclosure documents showed that at least one  consultant bought and sold shares of two energy companies within the same  month, raising ""a red flag"" about the possibility of insider  trading.  State law prohibits officials from participating in  decisions involving their personal financial interests.  The five  consultants fired last week were among 11 named in Jones' letter,  delivered to the San Francisco office of the SEC last Wednesday. It was  not clear which individuals are the focus of the SEC's inquiry, or whether  the agency's review would result in any charges.  Two of the former  traders said Monday that they had not been contacted by federal  investigators and knew nothing of an inquiry into possible insider  trading.  But William Mead, fired Thursday, said it is no mystery  why so many of his colleagues owned Calpine stock.  Mead said he  bought it 2 1/2 years ago and made so much money he recommended it to his  colleagues last year, while they all still worked for the now-defunct  California Power Exchange in Alhambra. Calpine power was not traded on  that exchange, so there was no conflict of interest, he said.  Mead  and three other energy traders--hired by the state in February and  March--were terminated by the Davis administration for allegedly buying  power for the state from Calpine while owning the company's stock. Fired  traders Herman Leung, Peggy Cheng and Constantine Louie did not list the  date of their Calpine purchases on financial statements that the state  required to be filed only two weeks ago.  ""But I'm sure they bought  it while they were still at the power exchange, because that's when we  discussed it,"" Mead said. ""It was kind of like a hobby. I'm sure it wasn't  done with the intent to manipulate.""  Former trader Elaine Griffin,  who also owned Calpine stock and resigned two weeks ago to take another  job, said she didn't know she owned energy securities until she checked  with her financial advisor July 13, just before leaving her state  job.  Griffin said she and her husband own about $10,000 worth of  Calpine stock in individual retirement accounts managed by their advisor,  who bought the stock Feb. 1 without their knowledge, she said, after  research found it to be a good investment.  ""I kind of feel like  we've been used for political reasons,"" Griffin said. ""We would have  disclosed anything right at first, but they never asked.""  As a  trader, Griffin said she occasionally bought Calpine power for the state,  but only at market prices.  Meanwhile, two Democratic political  consultants, who helped Davis polish his image after the ongoing energy  crisis caused his poll numbers to plummet, have agreed to accept no  payment for their work as part of an out-of-court settlement of a taxpayer  lawsuit.  Tom Hiltachk, a lawyer for conservative anti-tax activist  Lewis Uhler, said the settlement was reached last Friday after  negotiations with lawyers for communications consultants Mark Fabiani and  Chris Lehane.  ""Now they will not receive one red cent,"" said  Hiltachk. ""Very simply Mr. Fabiani and Mr. Lehane have agreed to cease all  activities for the governor, to accept no payments for their services and  to basically get out of the consulting business with the  governor.""  As his part of the agreement, Hiltachk said, Uhler  withdrew his lawsuit Monday morning.  Uhler had filed a lawsuit  against the two consultants and Controller Kathleen Connell in June  contending that they should not receive any payments because of a conflict  of interest. The two men also did consulting work for financially troubled  Southern California Edison, which was seeking help from Davis and the  Legislature.  Connell, a former Los Angeles mayoral candidate who  has been at odds with Davis since he endorsed an opponent, had held up the  payments pending the outcome of the lawsuit.  Under an agreement  with Davis, the men were to have been paid $30,000 a month for six  months.  Fabiani and Lehane could not be reached for  comment.  *  Times staff writers Nancy Vogel and Virginia  Ellis in Sacramento and Robert J. Lopez in Los Angeles contributed to this  story.

"speeding","A police officer pulls a guy over for speeding and has the following  exchange:
Officer:
May I see your driver's  license?
Driver:
I don't have one. I had it suspended when I got my  5th DUI.
Officer:
May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?
Driver:
It's not my car. I stole it.
Officer:
The  car is stolen?
Driver:
That's right. But come to think of it, I think  I saw the owner's card
in the glove box when I was putting my gun in  there.
Officer:
There's a gun in the glove box?
Driver:
Yes  sir. That's where I put it after I shot and killed the woman who
owns this  car and stuffed her in the trunk.
Officer:
There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?
Driver:
Yes, sir.
Hearing this, the officer  immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly surrounded by police, and  the captain approached the driver
to handle the tense  situation:
Captain:
Sir, can I see your  license?
Driver:
Sure. Here it is.
It was  valid.
Captain:
Who's car is this?
Driver:
It's mine,  officer. Here's the owner' card.
The driver owned the  car.
Captain:
Could you slowly open your glove box so I can see if  there's a gun 
in it?
Driver:
Yes, sir, but there's no gun in it.
Sure  enough, there was nothing in the glove box.
Captain:
Would you mind  opening your trunk? I was told you said there's body in it.
Driver:
No  problem.
Trunk is opened; no body.
Captain:
I don't understand  it. The officer who stopped you said you told him you
didn't have a license,  stole the car, had a gun in the glove box, and that
there was a dead body in  the trunk.
Driver:
Yeah, I'll bet the liar told you I was speeding,  too!

IMPACT CALLS


Portfolio Strategy 		Charles Reinhard
Cutting Exp. EPS, Eqty Returns, & Valuation

q The policy response to the savage attack on civilization continues to be
vigorous. A sustained
diplomatic and military campaign against terrorism is coming into place.
Monetary policy has been
aggressive, with more to come. And fiscal policy is swinging into gear.
Still, the United States is
likely to remain in recession for the remainder of 2001. We are thus cutting
our 2001-2002 S&P 500
EPS forecast from $49.25 to $46.50 this year, and from $59.00 to $53.00 next
year. In a riskier world,
we are also assuming lower valuation for the stock market. Accordingly, we
are cutting our forward
one-year S&P 500 price target from 1375 to 1200; the Dow Jones Industrials
equivalent is 10,000.

q Our Economics team is now looking for a shallow U.S. recession for the
second half of this year, with GDP
down roughly 1.5% in the third and fourth quarters. The jobless rate will
rise to 5.3%, we think, as CPI
drops to 1.9%. With the Fed Funds rate at 3%, expect the Federal Reserve to
cut rates to 2.5% at the next
FOMC on October 2. With core CPI at 2.7%, that would take the real Fed Funds
rate below zero.
Historically, the real Fed Funds rate has always gone to at least zero
during profit recessions of the current
magnitude. Whether the Fed will need to do more after October 2 remains to
be seen. That the central
bank will do whatever it needs to do is beyond question. With another drop
in short-term interest rates, the
yield curve should steepen further.

Charter Communications Lara Warner
Downgrade Rating to ""3"" from ""1"" 3 - Market Perform / 12.75 (USD)
q We are downgrading Charter to 3 Market Perform, from 1 Strong Buy, and
lowering our 12-month
price target to $17, from $33 previously.
q The company announced yesterday that Jerry Kent, its CEO, would resign
effective September 28, 2001.
q We believe that this event, as well as the potential for additional senior
management departures, increases
execution risk significantly for Charter.
q We have revised our estimates downward to reflect less robust new services
and advertising growth.

Bank of New York	 Henry Chip Dickson
Third Quarter Preview 1 - Strong Buy / 33.70 (USD)
q We believe BK should be one of the companies most leveraged and best
positioned to an
improvement in the economic and market environments because we believe that
improvement will
be preceded by stronger market volumes and greater capital market activity.
We continue to rate
BK 1 - Strong Buy, with a $50 price target.
q Because of the World Trade Center tragedy and the weak market conditions
that existed through the end
of August, we have reduced our 3Q01 EPS estimate to $0.50, which is below
consensus expectations.
We expect consensus expectations to be revised down over the next several
weeks.

Safeway Inc	 Meredith Adler
Going into 3Q w/some uncertainty 1 - Strong Buy / 40.65 (USD)
q Safeway's sales growth is the greatest area of focus, given the sluggish
performance in 2Q01.
Although we expect SWY to beat its 1.0% guidance, it probably will not be by
much.
q Comments by Kroger last week indicate a ""hot"" competitive environment in
some markets, with Albertson's
attempting to improve its pricing image with consumers. We expect both KR
and SWY to take steps to
protect market share.
q The weak economy is not likely to impact Safeway's sales much, given the
minimal exposure to
discretionary items.
q Safeway is trading at a 2002 P/E of 13.5x, well below historical levels.
The stock has not traded at this low
a P/E since a brief period in 1994. We view Safeway as a vastly better
company than it was at that time.

INITIATING COVERAGE

Tekelec 	Steven D. Levy
It's Time to Take a Look at Tekelec 1- Strong Buy / ($14.37)
q We have been culling through our comprehensive list of publicly traded
communications
technology companies looking for attractive investment opportunities.
q Tekelec is the leading provider of critical network intelligence systems
used by most incumbent carriers
around the globe, and in our research on Tekelec we have found that the
company is likely to be one of
the first to rebound when overall telecommunications spending picks up
again.
q We are initiating coverage of TKLC shares with a 1-Strong Buy rating and a
one year price target of $20.


Bed Bath & Beyond		 Alan M. Rifkin
Stellar 2Q EPS - Still Delivering The Results 2 - Buy / $22.96
q BBBY posted 2Q EPS of $0.18 versus $0.15 last year---a 21% gain, and in
line with our expectation
and original company guidance. We view the gain as impressive considering
the broad-based
slowdown that has impacted most retailers.
q The company posted a strong 21.1% increase in total sales to $713.6MM,
driven by an impressive 4.8%
comp gain, which was ahead our 3% estimate, as BBBY continues to post the
strongest sales gains within
our Specialty Hardlines coverage.
q Management continues to endorse 3Q and 2001 EPS estimates of $0.18 and
$0.72 respectively. We
maintain our Street high 2001 estimate of $0.74.
q BBBY remains one of our top picks, with a history of posting strong sales
and EPS gains irrespective of a
difficult macro economic environment.
q Valuation. BBBY shares trade at 31.0x and 25.2x our 2001 and 2002
estimates of $0.74 and $0.91.

Integrated Oil		 Paul Cheng
Weekly U.S. Crude Oil & Refined Products Inventory Summary /
q Despite the current cloudy outlook, we expect U.S. refined product demand
to hold up reasonably
well, as some of the lost jet fuel consumption should be replaced by
increased gasoline and diesel
demand as consumers opt for alternative means of transportation. We remain
optimistic regarding
the domestic refining market's medium-term outlook, and maintain our
overweight position on the
independent refiner stocks.
q On the surface, last night's inventory report from the American Petroleum
Institute (API) appears extremely
bearish given the outsize stock build in the gasoline market. At a closer
look, the data tells a somewhat
different story given that the huge inventory increase was driven largely by
very high import levels,
specifically, 1 million barrels per day (mmbls/d) over the past week, which
in our opinion is unsustainable.
In addition, we expect next week's implied gasoline demand to trend higher
from this week's dismal level of
approximately 8.4 mmbls/d as consumers gradually return to the road. Thus,
while the increase in
gasoline inventories was substantially larger than expected, we think it is
premature to draw any negative
conclusion. In contrast to the gasoline market, middle distillate stocks
experienced an unexpected decline
due to apparently strong demand, which is an encouraging sign although we
admit it is still too early to
know for sure. Looking ahead, despite the current cloudy outlook, we expect
U.S. refined product demand
to hold up reasonably well, as some of the lost jet fuel consumption should
be replaced by increased
gasoline and diesel demand as consumers opt for alternative means of
transportation.


Bowater Inc		 Peter Ruschmeier
Modest 3Q Shortfall not a Surprise 2 - Buy / (USD)
q Despite a modest 3Q EPS shortfall, we find shares of BOW as increasingly
attractive and
recommend adding to positions on any pullback.
q BOW expects to report a 3Q loss of $0.22 to $0.32 per share which is below
the consensus view but in line
with our expectations.
q BOW now expects to take 120,000 tonnes of newsprint downtime in both 3Q
and 4Q which is greater than
their previous guidance, but not surprising given recent trends.
q The risk to our 2002 estimate of $2.75 per share remains on the downside,
but we continue to believe
Bowater has peak earnings power of more than $10.00 per share.

FirstMerit Corp 		Brock Vandervliet
Compelling Valuation But Our Caution Remains 3 - Market Perform / ($22.00)
q FMER notched up a better than expected second quarter performance and we
have a high level of
confidence in our full year estimates. We remain concerned about the
manufactured housing
exposure. FMER 3 - Market Perform.
q Although we don't expect a large margin boost we would not be surprised by
a modest improvement on the
order of 10 bps which would be FMER's 4th consecutive qtr of margin gains.
Organic loan growth should
run in the high single digit range, which may be blunted by residential loan
sales like last quarter.
q Fee and expense growth which were both solid in Q2 should be marked by
similar performance with low
double digit fee growth offset by mid-single digit expense growth, largely
linked to incentive fees.
q Our perennial concern, particularly in this environment remains credit
quality. NPA's will likely climb
higher putting them above 70 bps with 50-60 bps of NCO's. Due to the
manufactured housing operation,
which is roughly $800mm on balance sheet or just over 10% of total loans, we
believe both NPA's and
NCO's will continue to run above the mid-cap average.

Marshall & Ilsley Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: M&M - Margin & Metavante 2 - Buy / 50.99 (USD)
q We continue to rate MI 2-Buy with a $62 price target.
q We expect MI to report operating EPS of at least $0.92 on October 10.
Reported results will likely contain
several acquisition related charges.
q Third quarter results will contain two months worth of MI's purchase
acquisition of National City Bancorp.
q We expect the quarter to evidence continued net interest margin expansion
and further improvement at
Metavante. We believe 1Q01 marked the bottom for revenues at MVNT.
q Sluggish loan growth could restrain further improvement.
q Asset quality metrics should hang in there, although an uptick in NPAs is
expected.

Wilmington Trust	Brock Vandervliet
Maintaining Est.But Consensus Looks High 3 - Market Perform / $51.30 (USD)
q We remain confident in our WL estimates as they are already conservative
and in the case of 2002,
our estimate is nearly $0.10 below Street consensus. However, the stock
could come under
pressure as others trim their guidance for '02.
q We carry a $0.96 Q3 EPS estimate for Wilmington Trust (WL)-in line with
consensus. WL is expected to
release October 18th. At this point we are maintaining our full year
estimates of $3.79 and $4.10 which
implies 8% EPS growth.
q In spread income we believe there will be some softness in loan demand
largely tied to C&I in the metro-Philadelphia
market. We believe the margin will decline somewhat to around 4.95% or
perhaps slightly
lower.

Countrywide Credit		 Makiko Coakley
2Q Met Raised Est. Raising Our 3Q Est. 2 - Buy / 40.21 (USD)
q CCR reported its fiscal 2Q (ending on 8/31) EPS of $1.20, meeting our
upwardly revised estimate
and beating the consensus by a penny. Its 2Q EPS was up 56% YoY and 20% QoQ.
Its 3Q earnings
should also be strong. We believe CCR should work as a safe stock, and thus,
it should do well
over the short-term especially if the market remains volatile and depressed.
q Most line items in 2Q came in as expected.
q CCR gave guidance for its fiscal 3Q EPS -- $1.20 to $1.25 vs. the
consensus of $1.12. This is based on
mortgage origination volume for the company of $30-$33 bil. in 3Q vs. $33.5
bil. in 2Q and $30.6 bil in 1Q.
We are being conservative and raising our number to $1.20 from $1.09.

Rockwell Automation 		Robert T. Cornell
Rockwell's '01 and '02 Outlook Revised 2 - Buy / (ROK-$13.67)
q Stock could reflect EPS uncertainty for a while
q Rockwell guides 4Q EPS in a $0.05-$0.07 range, and 2001 EPS to $0.91-$0.93
due to downturn in global
industrial automation market.
q Management now expects sales in 4Q01 and 1Q02 to be sequentially off 4%
from previous quarter. 1Q02
EPS to gain modestly over 4Q01.
q Accelerated restructuring could mean additional net cost savings of
approximately $50 million in 2002.
q We are moving our 2001 EPS estimate to 0.93 from $0.95 and 2002 EPS
estimate to $0.75 from $1.10.

RadioShack Corp 		Alan Rifkin
RSH/Blockbuster Tour In Vegas - New Date 1 - Strong Buy / 22.24 (USD)
q Lehman Brothers-Sponsored Trip to Blockbuster Store in Las Vegas Featuring
Newly added
RadioShack Store-Within-a-Store Concept.
q We are pleased to announce that we have rescheduled the Store Tour for
Monday, November 19, 2001, at
11 AM (preceding Lowe's Analyst Meeting), Lehman Brothers will sponsor a
trip for institutional investors
to visit the newly opened ""RadioShack Cool Things"" store-within-a-store
inside a Blockbuster store.

Time Warner Telecom		 Daniel Zito
Selloff Overdone 1 - Strong Buy / 9.15 (USD)
q Shares at distressed levels, despite funding cushion, interest coverage
and increasingly success
based cap ex. Reiterate 1- Strong Buy.
q Pre-announced 3Q01 revenue of $170-$175M below our street low $184M
estimate primarily driven by
timing of intercarrier compensation collections.
q Our prior $$38M EBITDA estimate is within the company's pre-released
$36-$39M range, demonstrating
the company's cash management skills.
q Lowering our 4Q01 revenue projection 3% to $180M and our 2002 outlook 1%
to $801M. Our EBITDA
projections remain unchanged.
q Share currently trade at 11.7x 2001 EBITDA and a favorable 0.39x on a
growth adjusted basis.

"ValueScience Corporation Overview","

Friends,

Most of you know about our company ValueScience Corporation, though for some
this is an introduction.  We have been ""at it"" for two years now, and have
created a really special company dedicated to developing world class tools
to unravel the mystery of building shareholder value.  We have attached a
very brief overview and FAQ which will help fill in some of the blanks, but
suffice it that we are setting out to completely change the basis on which
companies are valued, the way that we understand stock market behavior, and
the tools by which Senior Management sets priorities, allocates scarce
resources, and values transactions (e.g., M&A, private equity, IPOs,
technology acquisition)

Please expect us to begin communicating routinely to you about ValueScience,
comments on recent market events, insights about trends in value drivers in
key markets, etc..

Cheers,

Bob

	a) we are formulating a response to Chase on a possible fix to the contract plus who will be the senior sponsership in Enron (as per my bcc from this morning);

"Here's what you're missing...","Cinergy going into
summer long
on power

Cinergy CEO Jim Rogers told Restructuring Today in a three-part
interview that this summer prices will be low and electric supplies
plentiful.
     Is it the result of the June 1998 price spike that rose to $7,500?
Did the high price lure in generation that's now providing ECAR
consumers with economical prices at a time when the West Coast is being
punished for not doing the same?
     ""The short answer is yes,"" Rogers replied.
     ECAR is getting 4,000 mw more capacity this summer, he added.
     Rogers thinks the Ohio market will be slow to open and may not get
robust for five years.  He was critical of other IOUs that are dragging
their feet in RTO formation.
     We'd love to send you the Rogers interview and others we've
published recently:
     Walter Higgins, Sierra Nevada; Corbin McNeill from PECO Energy;
Marce Fuller of Mirant; Erle Nye of TXU, the incoming EEI chairman -- to

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Drow,

You don't want to hear this, but if they have already pursued every angle of appeal (A two sentence statement sounds pretty final.) to no good result, then they have to fight fire with fire.  If this was more a political move than anything else, they need to apply to come back in an equal and opposite posture so the national can look good accepting their application.

How?  Get the black fraternity on board (quietly at first) showing them this chapter ""was not fairly represented by these stupid acts"", something to that effect.  By on board I mean Beta leaders meet their leaders and convince them to endorse the application to national (A letter from them would be powerful, saying 'these guys are real and they are rushing some of our people', I don't know).  The re-charter, then, is a correction of the mistakes and, therefore, the new chapter is clean.

As you can tell, I know nothing of the procedures behind a charter and this could take forever, but what alternatives are there if the appeals fell flat?

To quote another ass from Little Rock, I feel your pain, as I have Travis, Tyler and Trenton coming along later and I will fight like hell to protect my guys from this type of injustice in any case.

Sarl, Hans Hohl, Carl

... And I hope to be a better one.

Carl Hohl: Tomball native.  Active father of 3 boys, Travis, Tyler and Trent; 2 dogs, Susie the Shelty and Socks the Beagle.  Wife is Paula, 'Commercial Real Estate Typhoon'.

Both Carl and Paula are in relentless pursuit of excellence in solutions to Real Estate sales and acquisition problems.

e, a Beta pledge at Auburn, called me last night to
>inform me their chapter's charter has been revoked, effectively ending 34
>years of Beta's at Auburn.  At a recent costume party, several pledges (Joe
>NOT being one of them) decided it would be funny to mock the all black
>fraternity on campus by painting their faces black and wearing that frat's
>letters.  As unbelivable as it seems, that one act set off a chain reaction
>in Oxford and the General Secy flew down and, in a two sentence statement,
>ended life for the Betas as they once knew it.  The incident coincided with
>the Delta Sig chapter doing something even more stupid at a separate party
>on a separate day where pictures showed up on the internet by their party
>photographer of three D Sigs dressed as a black, a KKK clansman and a
>Confederate soldier, all looking as if they were trying to hang or shoot the
>black.  Brilliant huh???  That incident really got the student body in an
>uproar and then the Beta deal came to light about the same time and bam,
>goodbye Betas.
>    I only tell the story here because there have been many news coverages
>of both events across the country, making the Betas look like they were way
>out of line when, in fact, it was pretty harmless and the black fraternity
>really was only tremendously upset with the D Sigs.  Joe, his pledge
>brothers, and the actives are in shock at the severity of the decision by
>Oxford and I must admit, so am I.  If any of you out there have any ideas on
>what to do about it, I certainly would welcome them.  Joe was really falling
>in love with that chapter and it had a ton of campus leaders in it, much
>like Gamma Omega did once upon a time.  My feeling is that the chapter
>deserved some serious and accountable disciplinary punishments and the
>chapter agreed what they did was stupid and in horrible taste, but to

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

such advantage.  If we tell you your prostate's gone to shit, that baby

		[IMAGE] 	
[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   This year, more than ever, Thanksgiving means family, tradition,  and the celebration of this uniquely American holiday. Cherished  memories and a slice of nostalgia touch the very heart of our  festivities. For you or a loved one far away, we've assembled  a grand Thanksgiving selection sure to speak of these warm, wonderful  holiday traditions.   Calyx & Corolla creates luxurious style with Thanksgiving-inspired  touches. Couture  Cornucopia  (shown right) is a true tabletop tradition set  to be a focal point in the holiday home. Our enchanting moss-covered  cornucopia brims with autumn?s bounty.  Nothing is cherished more than the feast upon the Thanksgiving  table. Celebrate your family meal with the added beauty of our  Harvest  Centerpiece . It?s an eye-catching collection of nuts,  leaves, branches and herbs designed to show from every angle.  If adding ambience to the air is your desire than you?re  sure to love our Harvest  Candle Ring , which symbolizes the cycle of the year and the  bounty of the fields.  The fall flower of the moment, Red  Rover Mums , is the emblematic floral choice this holiday.  With their dramatic shades of rusty red streaked with gold your  guests will be impressed by this glowing display. Not to be outshone,  our Sienna  Roses  are a fine consideration for a traditional family gathering.  Afterall, the rose is the National Floral emblem of the United  States of America.  At last, our Sale   page is now featuring limited-time holiday offerings & our  online Specials   make simply spectacular gifts.  Calyx  & Corolla   	[IMAGE]

"Migrate to a more Scalable Database","Hi Jeff,

Today's most challenging business and technical problems require and generate mountains of data. Managing this data explosion has become an incredibly complex task.

New implementations always require moving data from the legacy system into the new application. Products, components, customers, vendors and employee data - everything must be moved. And it doesn't always come from just one place. Sometimes data from multiple systems must be moved to one big 'integrated solution'.

The issues involved in data cleansing, formatting, converting and preparing for upload are so time consuming and so exacting that it makes sense to outsource select components of the project to an established firm with extensive experience in data migration!

How do you meet this challenge?

Live TechSolutions

Whether your need is for continuous sharing of information between single or multiple source and target entities, networks, applications or systems, or a one-time data conversion from your legacy system, our team has the experience and software utilities to convert and migrate data with incredible speed, precision and security.

Strategy > Analyze > Design > Test > Implement > Maintain

Live TechSolutions team minimizes the time, your valuable staff needs, to devote to solve application integration issues or to transfer critical data from existing software applications to new applications.
Our disciplined approach and demonstrated success in meeting deadlines with sensitive data is reflected in our refined methodologies and ""best of breed"" tools.

Our solutions seamlessly interface legacy systems to maintain ""mission critical"" functionality while integrating necessary information sharing.

Live TechSolutions is an industry leader in data migration and transformation services. We have helped hundreds of companies transition from a legacy software system to a variety of ERP, HR, and Payroll systems.

Jeff, Please let me know of a convenient time to contact you and schedule a more in depth conversation about our Data Migration Services.

"Best Wishes","Jeff - - -
   Let me add to my best wishes for you and Rebecca that I conveyed the other night at Vallone's, my sincere hopes that the next post Enron-CEO phase of your life brings you personal happiness, fulfillment, fun and contentment. Although we often had different perspectives, my one-on-one sessions trying to get deals past you, while few in number, were some of the most stimulating and challenging I experienced here. I regret we never worked closely together - - you're the only really smart guy I've been unable to convince of/ demonstrate my value to in my working life.  I think Ken Rice owes me for pissing you off and getting deselected to head the new US electricity efforts in '93!
 On a more somber note, I admired you for going over to Teeside last week to face the families. I can still remember vividly the faces, the destruction, the emotions in the hours after the San Juan Gas explosion in 1996. It was hard for awhile to get motivated to press ahead with the power/LNG project in the face of that tragedy and the distant thought that, gee, I'll be responsible for bringing the new facility to this island. Am I sure it won't kill people? If there was a catalyst or ""straw"" that tipped you across the line in asking how hard you're willing to fight just to keep doing the CEO job, instead of every other direction you could take your life, it wouldn't surprise me if the experience at Teeside was it. One changes, even if only subtly, after that kind of experience.
  Thanks for treating me civilly even when you were the most angry with the rest of EI. Good luck with your new marriage and the next phase of your life.

"","Jeff,
Like many, I was surprised to hear of your decision.  I know that it is a
very difficult time in the business environment, but I hope that things are
okay with you personally.  Once the dust settles and you get a chance to
decompress some, I'd enjoy getting together with you to catch up.

Let me know if there is anything Sallie and I can do.

Best regards,

"Texas Children's Hopes to Remain in The CHIP Program","As you perhaps will have read in today's ""Houston Chronicle,"" Texas
Children's Health Plan has sent the Texas Health and Human Services
Commission a notice of termination of our participation as a contractor in
the Children's Health Insurance Program known as CHIP.

The decision to send the notice of termination was made after we were
informed by the HHSC of a new individual member premium rate that would
cause the already substantial losses we have incurred from the CHIP program
to grow even more rapidly.  To date, the CHIP program in Texas Children's
Health Plan has recorded a $9.7 million loss.  The new rate is predicted to
cause an additional $16 million loss over the next year.

Texas Children's Wants to Continue in The CHIP Program

Even though we sent the HHSC a notice of termination, we continue to
negotiate with them in good faith.   We began these negotiations nine months
ago, in December, 2000.  That was when we realized the program, only six
months old at that time, had been designed without appropriate provisions to
cover the medical costs of caring for children with catastrophic and
chronically devastating conditions and illnesses.

One of the main reasons more than 48,000 CHIP families have chosen Texas
Children's Health Plan as their CHIP provider is that we are able to care
for the sickest children.  In fact, we are the only provider in the state
who has the medical, surgical, nursing and other allied health services to
care for scores of serious pediatric conditions and diseases.  This is not
bragging; it is fact.
What it means is that Texas Children's is experiencing significantly higher
costs in its CHIP program as we respond to the medical needs of many very
sick children in the CHIP program.

It is very important for all of us to know that Texas Children's Health Plan
specifically and the Texas Children's Hospital Integrated Delivery System
very sincerely want to remain in the CHIP program.  We were totally
supportive of its creation by the Texas legislature and continue to believe
the program fills a crucial void in providing health care to children who
otherwise would not receive it.

Texas Children's Is Not Alone in This Dilemma

It is also important to tell you that all the other CHIP contractors in the
state are experiencing losses from their participation in the CHIP program.
In fact, the Health and Human Services Commission itself has confirmed that
cumulative losses in all the CHIP programs in the state from May, 2000 when
the program began, to June, 2001 total $38 million.

We are relatively confident that both our past loss, which is 25 percent of
the total, statewide CHIP loss, as well as our projected losses are larger
than those of any other program.  Again, this is because of the large number
of very seriously ill patients Texas Children's has in its CHIP membership.


We Pledge Our Best Efforts to Find a Solution

I want you to know that Texas Children's Health Plan and the Texas
Children's Hospital Integrated Delivery System will continue to do
everything possible to find a solution to this situation.

In fact, Texas Children's Health Plan has retained two independent,
third-party actuaries who are working to validate both Texas Children's
Health Plan CHIP data as well as data developed by the Health and Human
Services Commission.

We recognize the CHIP program is still a young program whose complexities
have yet to be completely understood.  We know it can be improved in many
aspects and will dedicate ourselves to helping identify those improvements.


Texas Children's Hospital Will Continue to Care for CHIP Children

Once again, let me repeat that Texas Children's Health Plan is negotiating
with the Health and Human Services Commission in good faith to remain a
provider in the CHIP program.

However, if the Texas Children's Health Plan is unable to reach an
economically viable settlement on appropriate premiums to cover the care of
our very sick CHIP members, Texas Children's Hospital will still care for
them if they require treatment or hospitalization.

Because above all, we remain steadfast to our mission of providing the
finest possible pediatric patient care to any child who needs us.

Thank you very much for your continued support.

Mark

President and Chief Executive Officer

Subject:	Memo from Jeff Skilling

Dear Enron Employees:

I am saddened to inform you that there was an explosion and fire at our Teesside power facility in England at approximately 2:40 p.m. local time.  At this point, we know that two employees have died, and at least two others have been seriously injured. The area has been evacuated and the power station is currently off-line.  The cause of the incident is not yet known.  

Our hearts and deepest sympathies go out to the families of those affected by this terrible incident.  

Jeff Skilling

[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,   The finer things in life are sometimes green. Our modestly monochromatic  Fragrant  Eucalyptus Bouquet  (shown right) is a natural display of greenery  that shows true luxury has nothing to do with imposing grandeur.  Easy to arrange in our architectural glass vase, the bouquet can  be left to air-dry naturally for enjoyment indefinitely in the  home or workplace, and has a unique fresh scent.   With its handcrafted, grass-covered pot, our Grass  and Grain Sculpture  is an unusual dried arrangement in a natural  palette of beiges and pale gray-greens. Perfectly suited for any  type of gift giving, it is an interesting way to add natural beauty  to a setting and best of all, it requires no care.  As the weather changes, you can surely add warmth to a special  occasion with our decisively different Strawflower Plant . Also known as Everlasting Flower or Paper  Daisy, our cheerful Strawflower plant will bloom for months. The  papery petals actually make a rustling sound as the flowers open!  Two eclectic fall specials we are proud to showcase this October  are our Obake Anthuriums  and our majestic Protea   that create a much-admired tropical look.   Please remember National Boss?s Day is Tuesday, October  16. We invite you to visit our Specials   page for ideal gift selections & our Sale   page for limited-time offers.

the Redhead did to make it happen.
Tell me how to get on the Beta website and get on the e-mail list.  Hope the

"RALLY AGAINT TERRORISM","                         MEDIA RELEASE
FROM: THE FATIMA CENTER, 266 Elmwood Ave., Buffalo, NY 14222
CONTACT: Coralie Graham, 905-871-7607 or coraliegraham@softcom.ca
OR WEBSITE: www.fatima.org
26 October 2001 - FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATE

""RALLY AGAINST TERRORISM"" SET FOR NEW YORK
Mid-November prayer campaign targets 6 million Catholics

Thousands of Catholics in New York and around the world believe
that the terrorist attack against the World Trade Center was
prophesied by the Blessed Virgin Mary to three shepherd children
at Fatima, Portugal, on July 13th, 1917. A Rally Against
Terrorism, to be held at New York's Hotel Pennsylvania, from
Saturday, November 10th through Monday, November 12th, will offer
New Yorkers the chance to do something positive to make world
leaders listen to the Fatima Message.
     The Blessed Virgin Mary said, ""If My requests are not
granted ... the good will be martyred, the Holy Father will have
much to suffer, various nations will be annihilated."" According
to Father Nicholas Gruner, the ""Fatima Priest"", this foretells
tragic events like those of September 11th. ""This is it!"", he
says, ""This is what Our Lady tried to warn us about.""
     The Rally Against Terrorism is being held in New York
because, the organizers say, of the nearly 300 million Americans
who are at risk of annihilation, New Yorkers should be the most
aware of the death and destruction which can be rained on us from
the skies or delivered through the mail. The only thing we can do
to protect ourselves, they say, is to pray and campaign for
obedience to the Message of Fatima.
     Attenders at the rally will hear seven distinguished
speakers, including Father Gruner, explain the simple, step-by-
step instructions Our Lady gave us for averting an even worse
disaster. ""Everything else has been tried,"" the Fatima Priest
says. ""We have nothing to lose, and world peace to gain, by
insisting that the Pope and all the bishops do what Our Lady of
Fatima has commanded."" Participants will be urged to play their
part in making this happen.
     There will also be opportunities to join in Masses, Rosaries
and other prayerful devotions offered up in remembrance of those
who have died and for the protection of the living.
     Admission to the Rally Against Terrorism is free. Sessions
are scheduled from 8:45 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, November 10th through 12th, at New York's Hotel
Pennsylvania, 401 - 7th Avenue, between 32nd and 33rd Streets.
Further information can be found on the Fatima Website:
www.fatima.org.
                                                            - 30 -
NOTE TO MEDIA: We especially invite members of the press--
including electronic media as well as print- to attend and cover
the Rally Against Terrorism. For more information, contact Arthur

"","Jeff:

I managed to work your explanation about why you went to San Francisco into this piece, and I'm glad you gave it because no one has heard your side of that story yet. And thanks for the Reuters plug during the conference call as well.
By the way, in listening to the tape of the interview, I realize I didn't explain why I thought the scene out there sounded like it was from a Stanley Kubrick movie. I heard there were folks in pig masks, and with the pie throwing, cops and cries of ""Beat them!"" it could have been an outtake from ""A Clockwork Orange.""
Anyway, thanks as always for your time and candor, the latter of which particularly makes covering Enron a real blast. And I want you to know that you have the single-best PR department I've ever run across. Karen, Mark, John and Vance deserve special mention for the number of phone calls they take from me, and for the expedition with which they respond. They always deliver the goods.
See you after the third quarter.

Best regards,

CBH

    By C. Bryson Hull
   HOUSTON, July 12 (Reuters) - The thus-far cool summer in California and the emergence of specifics about Enron Corp's <ENE.N> limited involvement in the embattled California power market should ease pressure on the energy giant's stock, the company's chief executive said on Thursday.
   ""I think we are going to get through the summer just fine. In terms of the financial impact on Enron, it's pretty much over,"" Enron President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling told Reuters in an interview.
   The rhetorical attacks on the Houston company as an out-of-state generator ignore key facts about how much power Enron sold into California, he said.
   ""I don't know how they can keep using us as the poster child when all of the numbers keep coming out. The poster child ought to be the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power,"" Skilling said.
   According to sales records maintained by the California Independent System Operator, which manages most of the state's power grid, Enron accounted for 0.4 percent of the alleged $9 billion in overcharges.
   The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is slated to decide if there was an overcharge to California, and if so, how much should be refunded.
   The same records show that the L.A. municipal utility and other municipal utilities in the state overcharged PG&E Corp.'s <PCG.N> Pacific Gas and Electric and Edison International's <EIX.N> Southern California Edison utilities millions more than Enron did.
   ""I believe ultimately in the longer term, as people become more knowledgeable about the data and statistics, I don't think they'll harp on Enron so much,"" Skilling said.
   Skilling has personally felt the nasty nature of the duel between California and ""out-of-state power producers,"" the label California Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has used to blast energy companies like Enron. During a June 21 speech in San Francisco, a demonstrator threw a cream pie and hit Skilling in the face.
   ""I knew something was going to happen out there, but we  wanted to get our facts out and show our commitment to getting the facts out,"" Skilling said of the reason for his visit.
   After he was hit with the pie, Skilling calmly explained his and Enron's belief for the reasons behind California's power woes.
   While Davis blames Enron and others for jacking up wholesale energy prices, the companies pinpoint California's flawed deregulation scheme and a rise in the price for natural gas as the main problems.
   The latest manifestation of the flat-out war between California politicians and Enron is a California legislative committee's finding that Enron is in contempt for refusing to hand over confidential business documents in a probe into price gouging.
   The California Senate believes the finding gives them the power to fine Enron and possibly jail its senior officers.
   But just before the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted to hold Enron in contempt on Wednesday, the Houston company sued in a California court on a claim the legislature has no jurisdiction over them.

"THINKING OF YOU..HOPE YOU'RE WELL","
Dear Jeff,
     Had a send a note to tell you I'm thinking of you and hope you're well.
Heard the news at work late yesterday (Wednesday).  I don't know the details
of this but it was a tough call, I'm sure, and I'm in your corner all the
way. As I've told you, you have made all of us so proud and I love you very
much.  I know I'll learn more about all that's transpired but wanted you to
know I'm thinking of you.  This has undoubtedly been a period of much
thought, soul searching and reflection.
     I'm going to get you up to Alaska, yet. Tried to interest Jeffrey
during our January meeting. The region is just gorgeous! A Chicago Federal
Appeals Court judge, of all people---a gentleman by the name of Frank
Easterbrook---has just in the past 6 months bought the condo unit next to
mine in Girdwood.  Had a chance to meet him for the first time when I was up
in June. His brother, Greg, has authored a phenomenal and, perhaps most
remarkably, balanced book on the environment.  To have that subject
addressed in a balanced way is an anomaly in this day and age, and yet this
guy has managed to do it. I'm still wading through it in those moments I get
a chance to sit down and actually read a book. 35 beautiful wooded acres
have just come on the market in Girdwood--something I thought would never
happen---and I've made a bid for them. We'll see.  Will let you know how
that goes.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

"Enron's secret bid to save deregulation - PRIVATE MEETING Chairman pitches his","
Jeff
 
Candidly, this wouldn't have been my approach  (posh location, closed format, odd group, seemingly self-serving agenda).  
 
I read the article below  as unsympatheticand almost  mocking in its tonetoward Enron.  It's  noteworthy theBeverly Hills meeting was not covered in the Los Angeles  papers.  Instead, this article comes fromthe front page of the Bay Area's San Francisco Chronicle (Democratic bastion and  home to both of California's United States Senators, power broker Willie Brown,  Attorney General Bill Lockyer and the state's public utility commission).  
 
Consistent with myconcern about a ""coast-to-coast  firestorm""engulfing Enron, the New York  Times ran two articles today that were  unsupportiveof the  company.
 
q        Senator Calls  for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS
Senator  Dianne Feinstein called for hearings into possible improprieties between members  of the F.E.R.C. and private energy interests.
 
q        Enron's  Dispute With Utility in India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI
The  dispute between the Enron Corporation and Indian federal and state government  officials keeps getting messier.
 
These follow the Times'  tough piece on Ken Lay yesterday.   Undoubtedly, the Washington Post will have to get into fray  soon.
 
My feeling is that just as  with the ""business"" side, Enron's public policy strategy needs be well informed,  sophisticated and comprehensive.  I  fear that anything less will fuel the potential of undesirable outcomes for  Enron's reputation, leadership and shareholdervalue.

PS - May I have a copy  of the position paper that was circulated in the Beverly Hills  meeting.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation 
PRIVATE  MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur,  Chronicle Staff Writers 
Saturday, May 26, 2001  ?2001 San Francisco Chronicle   
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/26/MN209410.DTL   
Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries  this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to California's  energy crisis.  
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and  federal investigations and less rather than more regulation.  
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign  contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the  Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday.  
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham  Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990  and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star  Schwarzenegger;  
and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been  courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates.  
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified,  said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support  Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the  state's energy mess.  
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is  concerned that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power  markets by either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority  to provide electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create  and fund a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in  California.  
""They're trying to rescue deregulation,"" the source said of Enron  executives. ""They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea.""  
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper  titled ""Comprehensive Solution for California,"" which was obtained by The  Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in  debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of power  price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse.  
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway  electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power  generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by  regulators and economists.  
One of the talking points read: ""Get deregulation right this time --  California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers."" Another  point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving electricity.  
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and  was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a  competitive power market system.  
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially  produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from  generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this year,  Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion.  
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for  Enron, said she would ""look into that"" and then did not return repeated  telephone calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the  meeting.  
D.C. CONNECTIONS
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached  unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, Lay  supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs regulating  the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story also said Lay  essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support Lay's desire  to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay denied the  allegation.  
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief  executive of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of  Occidental Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant  Amgen.  
Among those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles  Lakers star Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton  supporter Ron Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's  first civilian space trip.  
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but  declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment  through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon.  
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor  attended,  
but was ""not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this  issue.  
His intent is to listen to all sides.""  
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to  Davis and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support  Lay's position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who  participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and  asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

    Thursday, May 31, 2001 Issue 29   EDITORIAL  Today and Tomorrow-what Asia faces and what we've all learned from the past  As you probably know, the Eyeforenergy team is off to Mexico next week for our Latin American e-business in energy conference.  But to prove that our interests are global, our Insight article this week focuses on the state of the energy in Asia.  Like their colleagues in Latin America, Europe and North America, energy executives in Asia are facing a host of changes-e-business, regulatory changes, and the commercialization of alternative and micro energy sources.  All of these are examined in the article below, and it paints an interesting picture of the state of play in Asia today and what sort of challenges they face tomorrow.   In other news, the move towards online trading continues apace in the energy industry (unlike recent developments in most other industries) with announcements by Pantellos and Duke Energy North America.  Pantellos' move into the international arena with its procurement solution points towards the increasing use of online marketplaces in the energy supply chain (or at least a refusal to give up in the wake of Petrocosm's demise).      While Duke's announcement of their move to OpenLink's software points towards the increasing use of Internet technology on the commodity side of energy trading.   Either way, the energy sector seems to be one of the few bright spots in the wake of the dot com gloom. The energy industry's measured response and refusal to jump on the e-commerce bandwagon at the start seems to be proving dividends now.  Perhaps the rest of the new economy is learning what it seemed that the energy industry always knew-the Internet is just another tool (a useful one, but just a tool) and at the end of the day you still need to get the oil out of the ground and the electricity to the customers.         Q&A   Mirroring the Marketplace   Founded in late 1997, Excelergy Corporation, Lexington, Mass., a developer of software products and technologies for online energy marketplaces, is one of several companies providing products and services in this arena.  Recently, eyeforenergy contacted Jay Sherry, vice president of global marketing, to discuss hybrid business models and approaches and the issues that face those trying to implement them.  Hybrid approaches to conducting e-commerce transactions online are rapidly finding a home in the retail energy space.  Such approaches are not being implemented for altruistic reasons; instead, for some, it's become the means to survival.  Determining other uses for existing technological expertise...

Dear Jeff,
 
Several months ago I sent you an E-mail describing  my personal situation in the EBS work force reduction.
You may recall that I relocated in March 2000 from  New York City. 
I left my job with AT&T of 18 years, sold my  home and moved my family to Houston with the promise of opportunity and growth  at EBS.
As we are both aware, due to decline in the  telecommunications industry, EBS had to release 20% of it's work force. I  harbor no ill feelings towards EBS or Enron because I realize this is an  industry wide problem.
I have been unsuccessful at gaining employment up  to this point. The severance package I received from EBS is running  out.
 
I guess I am asking you if there is anything  available in Enron corp for me? 
I am willing to pursue a career in a different  area. 
 
I am attaching my resume for your  review.
 
Any help you can provide would be greatly  appreciated.
 
Thank you,
 
Rob Picciotto

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.
Enron Global Technology

"FW: UM Grads","Jeff,

It took a couple of weeks, but I found exactly what you wanted (I hope).  The CFO at Texas A&M was in administration at Michigan for about 30 yrs and had a ""back door"" we could go through to get the info.  

Please let me know if you find the person you're looking for - that's all Bill Krumm asked for in return.

Thanks again for spending the time at Harvard and NYU last week.  I enjoyed getting to visit with you.

"YPO Regional Conference - Additional session","
Jeff,

As you know, you are going to be the keynote speaker at this year YPO Regional Conference next September.  The organizers are asking us if you will be willing to participate in a ""breakout"" session right after your speech.  The session would be 1 hour 15 minutes long and only a fraction of the 130 couples would participate.  Since the topics being presented at the same time are more family oriented ( The Aspen Contemporary Museum of Art, mother- daughter relationships, wealth and family business), Bill and I thought that if you decide to go ahead with this session, you would probably like to talk about a business topic form a personal perspective like how to become a CEO or the characteristics of a leader.

In my opinion, we will not get much extra from this additional session, but since you are involved with the organization, I wanted to check with you before saying that you were not available for an additional session. Please, let me know if you want to participate and what topic would you like to talk about.

Regards,

Ursula

"Corrected Organization Announcement"," Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, please welcome Ken in his new role.

"Thanks for the slides","
Dear Mr Skilling,

Please forgive this interruption to your business day, but I thought it might be time I owned up before you found out from someone else.

A.  I saw you speak at the Tibco conference in Las Vegas and I was inspired.  I've been at Enron for over 5 years, and I think it's fantastic that we using the 'strategy' word more and more.

B. I stole your slides and re-used them for my own purposes.  I hope you don't mind.

C. I think I can see how to move forward with our technology team to build the kind of systems ""structure"" that goes some way to mimicking the capabilities inherent in your new business structure. 

I thought you might enjoy thumbing through ""my"" slides and notes.

Regards,
Richard.

"Meeting with Mr. Idei","

Mr. Awano,

Per your recent request to Dr. Kitatani, we have contacted Mr. Idei's Office to
find out his travel plans to the US in June.  Unfortunately, we were informed
that he is currently not scheduled to be out in the West Coast in June, and
therefore, will not be able to meet with Mr. Skilling at this time.

However, we were also informed by Mr. Idei's Office that he would be more than
happy to meet with Mr. Skilling during his next visit to Tokyo.  Therefore,
please keep us posted on any future travel plans to Tokyo that Mr. Skilling may
have so that we may assist you accordingly.

Thank you and should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call.

Best regards,

Ann Rubin

We have reviewed the web cast from the Darden website of outtakes from Jeff's speech and interview at the Batten Institute event in May.
 
First let me say that both the audio and visual technical issues associated with the first version appear to have been remedied on your end--he now comes across loud and clear!
 
Further, we respectfully request the following edits:
 

In the ""Idea"" section, under subpart 4, please end the audio after the sentence: ""Innovation made money and significant amount of money"".  
In the ""California"" section, under subpart 1, please end the audio after the sentence: ""So it's not a surprise that there is a problem"".
In the ""California"" section, under subpart 5, please end the audio after the sentence: ""So I think you're gonna see a big expansion in wind-generator electricity"". 

Thank you for your cooperation in making these edits.  If you have any questions, please call either me or Ursula Brenner.

"eSolutions - Next Generation Concepts -  Ziff Energy Group","
Ziff Energy Group presents 
eSolutions: Next Generation Concepts 
for the E&P Sector 
November 7, 2001 Calgary, Alberta 
Conference co-sponsored by global leaders in e-business solutions:  SAP Canada, Schlumberger Oil & Gas Information Solutions, IBM Canada 
How would you like to harness the power of ""e"" to improve your E&P company's bottom line? 
You can. 
Attend our eSolutions conference and learn how you can improve your E&P business significantly by leveraging e-technology for operational and financial results. Recognized eSolutions experts will focus on the three key ways in which you can do that: 
1. PROCESS 
You know how important efficient processes are to the competitiveness of your business. Nothing helps your people identify and improve internal processes better than e-technology -- from enterprise and e-procurement solutions to collaborative tools and geotechnical systems. eManaged processes are essential for advancement in the new economy. Find out how to do it better, faster and more economically. 
2. BEST PRACTICES 
You have to stay one step ahead of the competition. To do that, you need to know how others are using e-technology to successfully manage their businesses. Speakers from leading eSolutions providers will share the latest practices of e-enabled companies -- proven practices that are getting results. 
3. COMMUNICATION & COLLABORATION 
Imagine your operations in Alberta and the UK being able to view and discuss real-time data simultaneously. Whether your organization is a large integrated oil and gas company or a small independent producer, your business is at the mercy of market forces. Your ability to communicate information and make decisions quickly will make all the difference in capitalizing on opportunities and acting on problems. Advances in affordable technical tools make it possible by delivering key information, when and where it's needed. Hear about the latest advancements in collaborative e-business tools, as well as amazing developments on the horizon such as the Alberta Supernet. 
Ziff Energy's eSolutions conference is being offered in conjunction with its annual North American Gas Strategies Conference, November 5-6, in Calgary. For more information, see our website at www.ziffenergyconferences.com, phone (403) 234-6555 or e-mail us at gasconference@ziffenergy.com

We have never met, but I have read and enjoyed your articles on Enron's bold business vision.  Stan Marek, head of Marek Brothers, in Houston is a good friend of mine, and he suggested I call you
directly, but I think an email may be more efficient.

I am CTO and Senior VP of R&D for a software company called Hyprotech.  We are second in the global market for process simulation technology, but I think first in innovation.

One of Hyprotech's philosophies is to ""model to the business boundary"".  This allows a business leader to have as clearer vision of the technical behavior of an asset to any depth and fidelity that is
appropriate per the desired modeling investment.

We do whole-asset models of refineries, chemical plants and power plants.  Also, Hyprotech is the only company with the full technical capability of modeling the entire business asset for oil and gas
operations from sand face to custody transfer (well-bore, riser, piping network, topside processing, transmission, separation, gas plant, compression, metering). As a result, Hyprotech has 80% of this
market.

Hyprotech is deeply into real-time online modeling for decision support and optimization.

We have been discussing with gas storage industry the possibility of basing trading on a full dynamic model of the facility.  The business motivator is that a full scope model coupled to an contract
and business parameters allows for a better estimate of the sensitivities of a trade.

I am a Enron stockholder and naturally thought that perhaps the same methodology can be applied as a real-time model-based data filter coupled to Enron's current decision support models for trading.
The real-time model is a virtual facility (much as a flight simulator is a virtual airplane) and should increase understanding, open up new possibilities, reduce risk and increase agility in trades.

My question is who at Enron the most appropriate person for discussing details and practicalities of this concept for your company?

Thanks for your attention,

Dr. Mark R. Broussard
CTO and Senior VP Technology
Hyprotech

"The Morning Market Call - Monday September 17th, 2001.","
			Good Monday Afternoon - Comments From The Local
Guys!

We're back!
We are also lost for words to describe our thoughts about last weeks attack.

We may have more to say over time. At this stage, we would like to refer our
readers to the Lehman Brothers website for a message from Richard Fuld, the
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer of Lehman Brothers.

IMPACT CALLS

Portfolio Strategy Jeffrey Applegate
After September 11, 2001
The dreadful events of this week will probably push the U.S. economy and
profits further down to a
'V' bottom; the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast
of -12% with a trough in
third quarter.
The dreadful events of this week will probably push the U.S. economy and
profits further down to a 'V'
bottom; the profits recession will now also be deeper than our forecast of
-12% with a trough in third
quarter.
 But the vicious nature of the attack has prompted a vigorous monetary and
fiscal policy response at a time
when the S&P 500 is more than 30% below fair value; we expect that the stock
market will rally on
primarily cyclical leadership.



Banks Update
The expectation of aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board and SEC
actions to ease
share repurchase restrictions should help many large cap bank stocks. We
highlight BAC, C, FITB,
FBF, JPM and WFC.
Following Tuesday's tragedy, the U.S. government took steps to increase
liquidity to the financial system
and provide additional sources of support for stocks. The Federal Reserve
provided liquidity and is
expected to reduce rates aggressively, while the SEC took actions ""to
Facilitate Reopening of Fair and
Orderly Equities Markets"".
The ramifications of these actions should include wider net interest
margins, increased mortgage refinance
activity, and an acceleration of share repurchase activity.
Some of the companies that would seem to benefit immediately from these
actions include BAC, C, FBF,
FITB, JPM and WFC.
q Our strategist, Jeff Applegate, recommends almost a double weighting of
financial stocks - 32% vs. a
market weighting of 18%.

Mid Cap Banks
We expect the Fed to aggressively lower interest rates during the remainder
of year. We view NFB
and SOTR, both of which are down 17% over the last two trading weeks, as
liability sensitive plays.
FTN, MTB and BBT should benefit from large mortgage banking operations.
The recent weakness in bank stocks and the easing of restrictions should
cause companies to increase
share repurchase activity. Companies in this camp include CBSS, FMBI, HBAN,
NFB, and TCB.
Our 1 rated stocks are CYN, CBSS, CFR, NFB, TCB and ZION. We view MTB and
SOTR as trading buys
at current levels.
Mid-cap banks tend to do well in a low inflation, low interest rate
environment which our forecast calls for.
The wildcard however continues to be the economy.

Electric Utilities
CT DPUC Draft Draws a Blank
CT DPUC releases draft decision that denies FCEL 26MW project entirely.
Reducing shares of
FCEL to Market Perform from Strong Buy due to lack of material catalysts and
potential downside
to $8/share.
Late Wednesday, the CT DPUC issued a draft decision that denied funding to
an ENE/CRRA proposal that
would have resulted in a 26MW order for FuelCell Energy.
While the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final
decision (early October), the
wording of the order appears to point the companies towards additional state
funding vehicles, which
would likely take multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this
point.
We believe the disappointing CT DPUC draft decision leaves shares vulnerable
to the downside ($8/share)
and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub MW and MW ""launch size""
order flow can be generated.
That said, FCEL's $7/share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate
technology should limit
downside even in the current market environment.


Electric Utilities
Gray Growing Weaker in Round 10
The CA Senate failed to reach agreement on a revised SB78XX and therefore
failed to call a vote at
the end of the legislative session. We maintain our Market Perform rating on
shares of EIX.
The CA Senate failed to reach a compromise on a bill to avert bankruptcy for
EIX's utility (SCE) in the wee
hours of the session. Although the major terms of a revised deal were
intact, the Senate lacked the votes
to bring a successful vote.
Gov Davis has called for a third extraordinary session in early October to
try to force a compromise bill
through both the Assembly and Senate. As anticipated, consumer opposition
remained the sticking point
but surprisingly Gov Davis lacked the political might to force the measure
through the Senate.
We maintain our Market Perform rating on shares of EIX as we continue to
believe the near-term earnings
and valuation are limited even if a bill ultimately passes.


Major Pharmaceuticals Charles Butler
Timing of Xigris Panel ? Restrictions ?
We are raising our peak sales estimate for Lilly's sepsis drug Xigris to
$2.6 billion from $2.0 billion.
The Lilly sepsis drug Xigris was scheduled to be reviewed at an FDA panel
last Wednesday. Due to the
tragedies in both New York and Washington the panel did not convene.
However, documents were made available on the FDA website regarding Lilly's
presentation and the
FDA's interpretation.
Some have interpretated from the FDA documents that while Xigris will be
approved, it may have a more
restricted label, thus reducing potential demand.
q We spoke with two members of the Xigris team on Friday and have concluded
that we do not believe a
restricted label for the product will occur.

Leisure Felicia Rae Kantor
A Mixed Bag
We fully expect the leisure segment to be under pressure in the first few
days of trading. Fears of
travel coupled with economic concerns do not bode well for the industry in
general. In this note, we
offer, sub-sector by sub-sector, a rational and logical snapshot of our
universe with the hopes of
helping investors reassemble the pieces of the puzzle after the terrible
tragedy that occurred on
9/11.

PC Software Neil Herman
Software sector in light of last week
The events of last week increase the risk that potential customers will
delay software purchases
near-term , but should help longer-term as companies increase software
spending, particularly as
they likely increase their focus on disaster recovery as well as reliable,
scalable, and redundant
systems.
q Veritas likely biggest beneficiary as about of its revenue is associated
with data backup and recovery.
Advent's dependence on the financial community puts it at risk near-term.
q Inability to travel last week likely negatively impacted consultants'
billing time.

Enterprise Software/Internet Software Neil Herman
Details of the Quarter
On Thursday afternoon, Oracle reported EPS of $0.09, slightly exceeding our
EPS estimate of $0.08
and $0.08 reported in the first quarter of the previous year. The company
reported total revenue of
$2.242 billion, which fell 0.9% from $2.261.9 million in the same quarter a
year ago. Oracle was able
to deliver from an operating margin perspective, with the operating margin
rising to an amazing
33.3% from 29.1% in the fiscal first quarter of 2001.

Autos & Auto Parts Nicholas Lobaccaro
Auto Stocks Likely Among Hardest Hit
GM and Ford Could Drop at least 25 to 30% based on DaimlerChrysler's stock
price reaction, which
fell by 23.5% last week.
Industry fundamentals, already weak, will likely deteriorate significantly
in the near term, with sales and
production likely to be disrupted.
GM and Ford, hampered by low level of profitability and weak balance sheets
before the tragic events of
last week, are vulnerable from a financial standpoint with access to credit
likely to be more difficult than
anticipated.
Aggressive monetary and fiscal policy, as well as military action, could set
the stage for an eventual
economic recovery, perhaps as soon as late 2002. In the mean time, business
is likely to be extremely
difficult.
Based on the stock price action during the Gulf War, we expect a significant
near term drop in stock prices
with the prices not bottoming out for some time, perhaps as long as 18
months.

Wireless Services John Bensche
Cell Phones In Unwanted Spotlight
Wireless services networks were stressed to the limit by last week's
WTC-Pentagon disaster by
enormous traffic levels. While some facilities were damaged, companies
predicted no material
impact to overall business conditions as a direct result.
The utility of wireless service showed itself in a very dramatic fashion in
multiple situations, and we may
see some above average activation levels in the short run.
The impact of a sustained war on consumer spending and air travel is likely
to be the largest factor for
carriers over the longer term.

NOTES FROM TODAY
Paper & Forest Products Peter Ruschmeier
Impact of Terrorist Attacks on Paper Ind
Last week's tragic events put a cloud over near-term relative performance of
paper/forest product
stocks but long term prospects remain favorable. Within our universe, we
maintain confidence in
our Strong Buy ratings on WY, MEA, and SPP. Leveraged producers such as GP
and SSCC may be
vulnerable. We would add to several Buy-rated stocks that should benefit
from a flight to quality,
especially BOW, IP, and W.
The prospect of war combined with a likely drop in consumer confidence and a
potentially deep recession
will likely lead to near-term underperformance of shares of paper companies.
Longer term, we believe
numerous positive factors as highlighted in this note will allow shares to
outperform.
We expect a ""flight to quality"" within the group. Companies with the highest
EBITDA margins (TGP, BOW,
WLL, SPP), the cleanest balance sheets (MEA, WLL, WY, SPP), the greatest
exposure to timberlands
(TGP, WY, WLL, TIN), and the lowest valuations based on EV/mid-cycle EBITDA
(SPP, BOW, LPX, BCC)
should benefit.

Entertainment Stuart Linde
Some Initial Thoughts
The Entertainment industry may remain volatile in the wake of the most
significant catastrophe in
US history. Advertising will undoubtedly be affected as will travel to
destination parks. Neither
should be more than a reaction to this unprecedented tragedy and do not
represent long term
secular changes.
The Entertainment industry remains in strong financial shape with all large
diversified entities having
investment grade balance sheets. Regulatory changes from the FCC are
forthcoming which could further
accelerate consolidation long-term.
Changes in programming have been put in place due to the events of last week
such as the timing of
certain sporting events, a delay for TV season premieres and also for
certain film releases. Networks and
TV stations have also continued commercial free news to assist their viewers
in learning of continuous
updates which will impact 3Q results.
In times of crisis, certain segments of the Entertainment industry will
outperform such as regional and in
home entertainment. Movie and home video rental/sales as well as TV
viewership will permit an escape
from the crisis at hand.

Banks Jason Goldberg
North Fork Bk Return to share Repurchase
We rate NFB 1-Strong Buy. With over 85% of its revenues derived from spread
income and
projected aggressive Fed actions in the nearterm, we expect solid results to
continue, despite
disruption in the Manhattan marketplace.
We expect NFB to increase its share repurchase program by 5MM shares,
bringing its authorized
repurchase to 8MM shares. This represents 5% of its outstanding shares and
14 days of average trading
volumes
 We also expect NFB to continue growing de novo in Manhattan and anticipate
the Commercial Bank of
New York acquisition to close in 4Q01. Pro forma, 3 of its 20 Manhattan
branches are below 14th Street,
one of which maybe consolidated after the acquisition closes.
 NFB should benefit from its diverse lending portfolio.
We do not expect systems issues to hamper customer service or hurt results.

Satellite Communications William Kidd
Sector - Economic Exposure is Moderate
In light of a looming global recession, we wanted to stress our expectation
for the satellite equity
group to hold up relatively well.
In the group, DBS companies are likely hardest hit by a weakening economy,
while FSS companies should
be relatively insulated.
DARS: XM is still waiting for an FCC decision on its repeater license.
However, XM equipment and service
are now being sold.

Internet Infrastructure Services Harry Blount
Update from Attack
This past Tuesday, Akamai experienced a tragic loss and announced a major
new agreement.
 Co-founder and CTO Danny Lewin was lost in the WTC tragedy. Earlier that
morning, Akamai had
announced the establishment of a significant new agreement with Compaq.
Akamai co-founder and CTO, Danny Lewin was lost in the first airplane that
crashed into the World Trade
Center.
We continue to rate Akamai 2-Buy.

"Frontline ""Blackout""","Good morning, Jeff.

	I caught Frontline's documentary on ""Blackout"" in its entirety this past Tuesday evening on PBS and found it quite interesting.  I was very impressed with both you and Ken Lay the way you bounced back the answers to the commentator's questions.  I've been with the company for 3-1/2 years and I am so proud to work with your organization more than ever!  This company houses a lot of support for you!

"United Way and Boy Scouts of America","I would like to share with you a personal struggle I go through as the
United Way contribution campaign rolls around each year.  First I would like
commend the United Way as an organization that does help people in need in
our community.  At the same time it funds the Boy Scouts of America, an
organization with an explicit policy to discriminate against gays.

I know I can direct my contribution within United Way, but not until the United Way
sees a drop in its total fund raising will it withdraw funding of the Boy Scouts
of America. I hope all involved in this effort understand why I and others
choose not to contribute to the United Way and instead make direct contributions 
to organizations that do not discriminate.

"Crown Energy","I spoke with Oscar Wyatt this afternoon on Crown and subsequently to Tom Bachtell, an attorney in Utah who is attempting to organize shareholders to replace existing management.  Crown has an asphalt oil sand production facility in northeast Utah and an asphalt distribution company.  Bachtell owns about 4-5% of the stock.  Mr. Wyatt indicated he had a ""small"" holding.  I indicated that we would consider any proposal that might result in salvaging some value from this investment.

We hold convertible preferred and a small amount of common at an original cost of $5.5 million in 1997.  Fully converted, our ownership would be approximately 25%.  The Company has a net deficit of $21 million and a ""going concern"" paragraph in its audit opinion.  We have written down our carrying value to nil.

The Company in engaged in an arbitration proceeding against MCN Energy and MCNIC Pipeline.  MCNIC has interests in the asphalt assets and is a lender to Crown.  MCNIC attempted to foreclose on certain Crown assets and Crown in turn counter-sued for $100 million.  The arbitration hearing will be held July 23 - August 10.  If Crown obtained an award from the arbitration, some value could be restored to our investment.

We will get further information from Bachtell on the details of his plans and recommend what position Enron should take in this matter.

"Your campus visit","Jeff and Christie:

It was a pleasure having you here on campus.  Let me add my thanks to those
of the Entrepreneurial Manager faculty who actually taught the case.  I
think your presence added enormously to the success of the maiden voyage of
this case.

As I indicated to you, I want to make the case even stronger by
incorporating any additional data or suggestions that you may have after
seeing it taught.  Jeff, you indicated you had a couple of quick
corrections, and I'd appreciate receiving those.  Also if you have any
thoughts about how we might enrich the case, those would be welcome
too.  Christie, as indicated in our discussions, I think some sense of the
economics of Enron Online would be enormously helpful.  Even if we have to
use disguised data, can we break out the sales and profitability of the
trading operations before the launch of Enron Online.  With some indication
of what the new Internet-based model will do to margins, students can do
some simple calculations of the volume necessary to compensate, and
therefore have some idea of the enormously ambitious (and significantly
risky) venture that this turned out to be.  I will gladly talk further
about this with you directly or with whomever you want to put me in touch
with.  Let me emphasize that the data do not have to be actual data--we can
use disguised information that multiplies all the real data by a factor,
for example.

Thanks again for your incredible support through the development of this
material and its delivery.  I think it was a great success.

Regards,
Chris

P.S.  I am just looking at the beta version of the multimedia cases on
Enron's Transformation and Enron Online. These should be ready within a
couple of weeks and will allow students to read the case and click on
images of Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, and Louise Kitchen as they talk about the
issues raised in the case. This should help students come to class with an
even richer understanding of the culture, values, and personal style of the
key players.

"Commonwealth Club Talk","Dear Jeff, 

I just wanted to let you know that I thought your talk last night was inspirational.  

I have been working in the San Francisco office for 2 years helping to permit sites for generating facilities.  During this time our team have had to endure more than our fair share of irrational and misinformed individuals.  One thing they didn't teach me at business school was how to educate people in a hostile and political environment while maintaining your dignity and humility.  Your example last night has certainly set a new personal standard for me to strive for.

Sincerely

Sec. of State for Near Eastern Affairs and President Reagan and President Bush as U.S. Ambassador to the Syrian Arab Republic.  He served in the United States Army as a First Lieutenant in the Republic of Korea following his graduation from the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University and holds both a BS and an Honorary Doctorate from Georgetown University and is fluent in Arabic, Russian, French and Armenian.

"Welome Back to Turkey","     Hello Sukran and Mark;
     Welcome back to Turkey.
      I hope the weath weather is better in Turkey than here as it has been
cold for spring.  Temps in the 50's during the day and while we have had some
sunny days there has been plenty of rain.  I have been busy with my Golden
""K"" Club (Senior Citizen Kiwanis).  We help with a picnic for mentally
retarded children, read to needy preschool children, help at mentally
retarded track meet, go to weekly meetings and etc.  I am told May is the
busiest month and it has been but it is almost finished.
     Mother and I have been watching the weather in Italy and imagining what
the two of you are doing.  Sue is back and catching up on their business.
This week besides Foundry work they have Visited an honorary dinner for one
of Jeff's college professors.   They are also doing some major work  on their
house.   The Sweeps are over at WGN-TV for a while so now Tom is looking
forward to his trip to Alaska a week from Thursday.  Jeff is still busy with
the gas problems so we hear little from him.  I hear Peter Widman is getting
married.  Though nothing definite I hear it will be in the fall.
     Nothing else for now.  Let us hear from you.   In the meantime  WE SEND
BOTH OF YOU  LOTS of LOVE and KISSES    MOTHER and DAD

I was the person who asked the question "" What are your metrics for becoming the World's Leading Company"" today in the EES floor meeting.
I appreciate your answer, and hope together we all can make it become a reality.

I also have been the Macerich Account Manager since contract inception-- and wanted to convey to you the  appreciation and thanks that their
senior managers expressed to me last week when I provided Macerich with a 6 month update of our  deal.

They asked me to tell you ( and Angela )  that your attendance at their conference was a ""huge hit "" with employees.  In addition. many of their employees have told them your presentation was  extremely compelling and that many of their employees have used the presentation you gave to think about new ways that they can ""innovate"" and ""create value"" for Macerich in their daily operations.   

Thought you would like to know.

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online Financial -- October 1, 2001","
KUDLOW'S TAKE
by Lawrence Kudlow


DECLARING WAR ON RECESSION
Why isn't the administration endorsing bold measures?

October 1, 2001 8:00 a.m.


Crucial to winning the global war against terrorism is a bold plan to wage
war on the domestic recession. But Washington has no such plan. Respected
policymakers look timid, cautious, and out of touch with the reality of a
declining economy. Veteran graybeards advise Congress to do nothing,
seemingly deaf to an economic call to arms.

The latest unemployment claims report ratcheted up nearly 60,000 to
450,000 - a nine-year high. This implies a huge drop in jobs and a big jump
in unemployment is on the way. A just published and miserable durable-goods
report says the technology sector is evaporating in cyberspace. Over the
three months ending in August, a composite high-tech index for shipments
dropped 50.1% at an annual rate. Technology was the biggest contributor to
the economic boom of the 1990s. Now it is the biggest drag. Even consumers
are suffering from terrorist aftershock as weekly chain-store sales are
turning negative.

Something has got to be done, but Washington isn't doing it. The Bush
administration's economic officials have been ineffectual. There is no
action-plan script, no talking points, no communication strategy. In short,
there's no leadership on the domestic economic front. The administration is
performing brilliantly in the early stages of the war against terrorism. But
thus far, it has shown no similar instincts in the war against domestic
recession.

If the domestic slump is left unattended, the nation will eventually become
demoralized. Without economic vitality at home, it will be all the more
difficult to maintain our edge overseas. Rising unemployment drains the
spirit, but we need exactly that spirit to conquer our enemies.

The economy needs a jolt. It needs risk-taking. But policymakers seem
unwilling to take risks. Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan - who keep telling
us that too much stimulus will cause inflation - are providing more
status-quo thinking at the very moment we need leaders who can size up the
current situation and then think outside the box to provide solutions.

Mr. Rubin's arguments about budget surpluses and long-term bond rates are
red herrings at best. Actually, as the recession-driven federal budget moves
into deficit, Treasury market interest rates are dropping to 40-year lows,
undercutting Rubin's entire argument on the need to maintain budget
surpluses at any economic cost. He has never understood that growth produces
surpluses, rather than the other way around. The former Clinton Treasury man
tells us that demand-side consumer tax rebates are okay while supply-side
tax cuts on successful high-end earners and capital investments are not. Go
figure. This is not economic analysis. It's a plain vanilla,
liberal-redistribution agenda.

Mr. Greenspan, meanwhile, says that capital-gains tax cuts are not the best
way to deal with the economy's short-term problem. Yet it is exactly the
deflation of capital asset values through the stock-market decline and the
deepening slump in business profits that cries out for new incentive rewards
for capital investment. Instead of pompous proclamations, let's do an
historical scrub of the after-effects of cap-gains relief. If we do, it will
show that faster economic growth, rising stock markets, and stronger budget
revenues always follow lower tax-rates on capital investment.

Jack Kemp and Sen. Zell Miller have it exactly right in their editorial
proposal to slash cap gains, accelerate the depreciation of investment in
plant, equipment, and technology, and make the phased-in personal tax-rate
reductions effective immediately. Their monetary view that the Federal
Reserve should abandon its interest rate target in favor of larger emergency
cash injections is also correct.

So, why aren't administration economists endorsing these bold measures? Why
aren't they making the case that it's business that creates jobs, and that
business desperately needs a fresh capital infusion? No amount of consumer
tax rebates will stop the unemployment rate from rising if capital-starved
and profit-losing businesses don't get immediate relief from a permanent
reduction of tax-rates. Bush policymakers should also make the case that the
twin crises of war and recession will require a temporary budget deficit of
roughly 1.5% of GDP ($150 billion) to finance tax-cuts, defense, and
infrastructure-rebuilding policies that are necessary to re-ignite economic
growth.

The public is four-square behind the president in the global war against
terrorism. It will also stand four-square behind the president in the war
against recession. Indeed, the public knows that a strong domestic economy
is vital to the war effort. Since President Bush's spectacular speech
rallying the nation for the global war against terrorism, the Dow Jones
stock index has appreciated 7%, or roughly 600 points. If the president
rallies the nation with a war plan to end recession, the market will rise
exponentially, signaling economic recovery and the revival of the American
spirit.

"Cliff Baxter","It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

Jeff --

The buzz from your Players segment on the trading floor will  create a big  buzz
among our audience when it airs  Sunday, May 20th on CNN at 5:30 CST. It was
great meeting you. Thanks for your  fresh outlook on leadership  and for your
candor on your plans to make Enron the world's largest company. Judging by the
energy around headquarters, ""Houston's not going to have a problem""
accomplishing just that.

We're working with Vance on internal promotion, so that all Enron employees can
tune in, and we'll also send copies of the interview  in the next week .

As I mentioned, I have done over 70 of these interviews...around the
world......and your combination of charisma and smarts and brevity is at the top
of the list.

Enjoyed meeting you, and hope to see you at the Olympics in Salt Lake!

"Business 2.0 Interview","Jeff -- You are scheduled to do a telephone interview with Erick Schonfeld on Friday from 2 to 3 p.m. for the cover story in the August issue of the new Business 2.0.  The story is about the e-commerce survivors and the lessons learned over the past five years.  The featured companies will be Enron, UPS, Charles Schwab and MTV.  The following are questions Erick will cover during the interview.

 

1.  There's been a lot written about the New Economy, and in the past year
we've seen that a lot of the theories about it have been hokum (first mover
advantage, only the young can innovate, the Net will destroy established
business models, etc).  Yet the business environment has not reverted to
what it was five years ago.  So of all the ups and downs, the hype and hope,
what is the single biggest change in the business landscape over the past
five years?  What is the one change that you grapple with in a very real way
every single day?  Is there really anything new about the new economy?  What
is it?

2.  Of all the things that people said were going to change, what hasn't?

3.  From what you can tell, what do you think will be the biggest change in
the economy over the next five years?

4.  How has Enron rejiggered itself to accommodate the change that has
occurred?

5.  How must Enron position itself to take advantage of the big changes to
come?

I will come to your office at 2 p.m. to place the call.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!  Karen

"FW: Monday Meeting","Jeff:

I'm sure this is just a ""misunderstanding"", but I know that UBS Capital has spent innumerable hours with management.  While Mark says that he doesn't want LJM to have an advantage, it looks like LJM is being put at a disadvantage.  You would think that Cliff and Mark would welcome a new bidder with open arms after failing to sell this business for 2+ years.  Until this is resolved, I'll assume that LJM is out of the bidding and will not do any further work.  Enron is back to one bidder (the lower one) -- better for our company ???

Andy - Mark Metts called tonight and has asked me not to meet with you in Houston tomorrow.  His stated concern is over disparate/more favorable treatment of you (LJM) as opposed to other bidders for EWC.  As we have discussed, while I am very interested in an LJM financed MBO, at this stage I need you to sort out any process issues with Cliff/Mark and/or Jeff.  Let's meet as soon as that gets worked out.  In the meantime, I won't travel to Houston Monday but will call to chat.  Thanks. Adam

Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and  to meet you at the luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be  interested in the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection  with the bike ride over the weekend.
 
Several persons  who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking if I am still alive  after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past weekend. Others have asked for  a report of my experience. I am alive and sore. If you are not interested in the  report, please delete this email.
 
First of all, for  those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable to the National  Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate word.  Remember  that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yourself with your  contributions.
 
This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story  unlike anything I ever expected.
 
Here is my story, if  you are interested:
 
BASIC  FACTS:
 
1.  I did show  up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).
 
2.  I did start  the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in the largest charity  bike ride in the country.
 
3.  I did ride  my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day, some 199 miles down  the road..
 
4.  I did  either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 182 miles of the  199 mile route.
 
5.  I crossed  the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the deadline of 6:00 pm  on Sunday.
 
6.  I ended up  meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip.  That  resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the pack of  9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before I reached  Austin.
 
7.  I am  extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't have the time  to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate to have a schedule  which opened up just in time for me to enter this  event.
 
 
RANDOM GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS:
 
1.  The charity  event title, ""MS150"", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for this event, I  understood the ""150"" part of the event title to refer to the mileage between  Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The ""150"" I now understand to mean the  approximate number of blisters to be found on one's posterior when a biker  crosses the finish line.  
 
2.  I have  driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There are routes  between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle  grade.  We took a different route.
 
3.  The ride  from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route we took was almost  40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a map appeared  similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an Aggie to find  the shortest distance between two points.
 
4.  Road kill  if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.
 
5.  The chicken  ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  The  LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the  first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club  volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with ranch  dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and  wondered whether the historical connection was  intentional. 
 
STRATEGY
 
I knew when I signed  up for this event that I had almost no chance of completing the ride which, at  the time I entered, I thought was only 150 miles.  I had not trained at all  for the bike ride, and was (and am) not physically fit and dont exercise as I  should.  The total extent of my bike riding during the year prior to  the event was when rode my mountain bike from my home to a  sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip.  Round trip,  my ""training"" ride to the sporting goods store was about 3  miles.
 
I sufficiently  realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some advantage  to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with what I  thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked for the  largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike during  the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that person  (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I thought  it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had a slower  pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end of the  ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person  appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath  of air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and  pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.    For the first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could  tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly  behind this large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person  biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on  this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another  biker.
 
I needed a new  strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materialize in spades,   but not before noon the second day of the ride.
 
 
THE RIDE IN  DETAIL
 
I signed up for this  event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a result of my schedule  opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily commited.  I  did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning when I  learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I started the fund  raising effort, which is a required part of participating as a  rider.
 
Iknew I was  out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco in even attempting  this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not keep up the normal pace  of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I made a pledge to  myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert myself.  I would  establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being winded.  I  succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of the  ride.
 
I kept a pace that  was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride for the first 4  hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happy with the ride,  and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the announcer has  promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker when we reached  Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to Bellville, I came to  realize that my pace, although not strenous, was substantially off the  mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders, there were only four  box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I thought back, I  remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my count,  9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.   They all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace  at little after lunch.
 
I headed out after a  quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around 2:00 to 3:00, I  was really getting tired and although still cautious about over exertion, I was  losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in  a small town, and  called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did not think I would make it  much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I could.  I rode about 10  more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when I remember thinking  ""I desparately need a long rest"".  About that time, I looked up at  a road sign that said ""Cemetery, next exit"".  The symbolic connection  was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporary,  not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in  some high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and I  bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a ""SAG"" bus, designed  to pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, into  a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was ""finished"" and that I did  not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I was  extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about 80% of  the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I concluded I  was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.
 
After traveling in  the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance to a ranch of a  friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. I asked the van  driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was home.  I went to  visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and I ended up spending  about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I finally decided to  leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength.  I thought I  might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I rode for about  another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van came and picked me  up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue. I was only 3 miles  short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, and the van carried me on to  this historic spot.
 
I had really been  looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a member of Team Enron, and  Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by reputation, outstanding.   They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to the Team Enron bikers, and a  dinner fit for a king would be waiting.  Unfortunately, by the time I  arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our accomodations for the evening, dinner  in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuses had vanished.  I finally  found a general meal service hosted by the local Rotarians who were serving  barbecued chicken, and a salad with ranch dressing.
 
Since I didnt enter  the bike event until less than two weeks before it started, Team Enron's private  tent was full and I was relegated to find sleeping space on my own.  I was  directed to a huge feedlot covered with a large tin roof, open air style (no  walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag under the big roof with  about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I was probably to sleep where a  cow going to market had probably slept only days before.  But I was dog  tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have the energy to find less aeromatic,  alternative, accomodations.  
 
 
THE SECOND  DAY
 
 
I was told that  breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and that the ride would  start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I could sleep until 6 am,  grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate by 640.  Needless to  say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible.  I badly  needed the rest. My plan failed.
 
I did not take into  consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gung-ho superbikejocks.   About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake up, a large group of  overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing side straddle hops,  stretching, and various exercises while making Monica Seles-like grunting  noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go back to sleep! The  five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly  inadequate.
 
I was told that Day  2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1 because of the more hilly  route as we approached Austin.  To make a long story short,  I  actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I actually learned some  technique for transferring power from my arms to my legs, and made it to Austin  on my own power without any motorized help of any kind.
 
The ride through the  hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a taste of ole country Texas  along the way. The bike route intentionally  meanders via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy  highway traffic for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one  small town that I never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that  said  ""THELMA'S PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS"". A sign of equal size  immediately adjacent said ""NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE"".  It was  comforting to know that patrons of that establishment could drink  peacefully while game playing, knowing that customers are  required to  go out to the parking lot to resolve domino disagreements where guns are not  prohibited. I guess I have spent too  much time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about the  genuine Texas back country!! 
 
 
There was one other  noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State Park is known to be  one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of the extreme winding hills  in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park is also confusing  because of its multiple intersecting roads through the park. I was  following another biker as we approached the park who was sporting a very fancy  biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I mentioned to him  that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State Park because of the  challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a route through  the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles shorter than  the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the prospect of a  short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and shorter  route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according to  my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep inclines,  and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and ten  minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the park--------------at  the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted and not  amused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the  shortest route to Austin.
 
To fast forward the  story, since this has been far too long already, I made it to Austin on my own  power and did not ask for a lift at all the second day.  I was looking  forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived at the finishing line  at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put in my most strenuous  effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very hilly Austin area where  every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing cousin.  Unfortunately  for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming back to Houston, I was  told just after crossing the finish line that the last bus would leave  for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time to  shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat  shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I dreaded--he  introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't want this guy  to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus the aroma  of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I held out my still  sweaty hand, and proudly said, ""Howdy, my name's Harry  Reasoner.""
 
Conclusion:
 
I participated in  this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and others who are victims of  MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo pledges that are impossible  for anyone to calculate, please send my secretary a check made payable to  National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever amount makes you happy.  If  you have not made a donation, won't you do so today? You will benefit by giving  as much as the people with MS who need your help.  Thank  you.

"Arizona","Hi Jo and Dave;   I guess you are moved to the desert by now.  I won't say
any thing about being settled as yet because Betty and I have moved and we
know it takes a while to get settled.
      Sue is already to go to the wedding as she will leave for Istanbul
about May 1.  Jeff is figuring on being there but I don't know his plans.
Tom cannot get away at this time and Betty and I both agree we are better off
waiting until this coming fall to meet the bride.  That would be a long trip
for us.
      The weather turned to spring but not for long and we had snow showers
yesterday maybe today too as it is cold enough.  I heard it was in the 90's
in Arizona.
      We will keep you informed of all the wedding news.
      Love and Kisses      Betty and Tom

Subject:	RE:  MS150

I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are similar diseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her & all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then pedal a little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

Sincerely,
Michael L. Brown

Joannie,

I'm back in town and have everything set for Friday AM at 9.  I am also
going to Hobby Performing Arts immediately afterwards with Paul Hobby and
we'd love to have Jeff join us for a short tour of that job as well.

Thanks,

"Autumn Intrigue","
		 	
		[IMAGE] 	
[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Selecting the right gift or seasonal accent to adorn your home  or office is made easy with our original bouquets, orchids and  preserved designs. Each of these intriguing items has its own  character and ambience and is meant to complement the good life.   Take our Orchid  Blaze Bouquet  (shown right) for example. With its fiery orange  orchids and black matte vase, it makes the perfect seasonal centerpiece.  This eye-catching bouquet is easy to arrange too.   The Colmanara  Orchid Plant  is quite possibly the most exciting new orchid  to be introduced in the last decade. This alluring orchid, nicknamed  ?Wildcat? is diligently sought-after for its long lasting  blooms.   Our Antiqued  Holiday Wreath  is a preserved design whose color scheme works  with most decors. It is available with our brass wreath hanger,  making it a breeze to display. And don?t forget the ideal  autumn birthday gift! The Golden  Harvest Roses  bouquet is sure to add special meaning to a  wonderful occasion.  Remember to visit Autumn  Sales  where you will find keen gifts like the Autumn  Jewel Arch  at very special prices!  Calyx  & Corolla   	[IMAGE]

"DPR by commodity","We have designed an additional Daily Position Report which consolidates P&L, positions, maturity gap, and VAR by commodity rather than business unit.  In accordance with the Risk Policy paragraph III - Limit Structure, possible breaches of limits are monitored against commodities rather than Business Units.

This report is currently being published to the Executive Viewer under the name of DPR RAC (will be retitled to DPR commodity). We are in the process of granting each one of you access to this report.  When access is granted to all DPR viewers, we plan to remove the limits amount off of the Business Unit Daily Position Report as the limits are granted by commodity, not business unit.

Please contact me with any questions/comments or concerns.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Jeff,
 
Nice work. In my opinion you did a much better job than any of  the others interviewed for the program, including the VP.
 
That last portion with the CEO of Duke and Gray Davis reminded  me of a lot of those ""60 Minutes"" episodes back in the good old days when they  used to catch people with their hands waaay down in the cookie jar. Good lord  those two looked terribly guilty of something.
 
Please remind my sister that she is supposed to give me a  heads up on things like this.
 
Hope all is well.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

"strategy+business enews Exclusive: Security, Strategy, and the Commercial Enterprise","Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from  srategy+business.

This Week:
Security, Strategy, and the Commercial Enterprise
By Ralph Shrader and Mike McConnell

Washington, November 2, 2001 - President George W. Bush has confirmed what many of us in business already understood intuitively: The new war on terror will be fought not just by governments and soldiers, but also by the companies, large and small, that comprise the global economy - the terrorists' real target.

""Terrorists want to turn the openness of the global economy against itself,"" the President told executives attending the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai recently. ""We must not let them.""

If we are to surmount the grueling test the free world now confronts, we must adapt both national and corporate strategies toward an unfamiliar but absolutely necessary goal: promoting openness and maintaining security at the same time.

Rising to that challenge, though, will not be easy. Our whole way of doing business has long been evolving toward greater openness and more individual empowerment. But as the assaults of September 11 have shown, transparency and empowerment allow technological, political, and social forces, abroad and at home, to threaten us. Yet to withdraw into protectionism, while a natural instinct, will prove far deadlier than Al Qaeda and its associates.

"[smu-betas] Thank you for being great friends.","My Dear Beta Brothers:

    I would like to report on the fabulous show of support displayed by my
many Beta brothers this weekend at my book unveiling in Norman -- Woody,
Benson and Grumbles from Dallas; Porter and C-Ci from Tulsa, along with
Strange and Ellsworth from OKC. Hess tried to get there, but a cancellation
in the original party venue kept us from seeing him.

    Thank God I am a Beta. I was touched beyond belief to see your smiling
faces Friday night, especially during a time when I am catching shit here.
The original party was cancelled three days in advance a Nazi named Dr.
David Boren, the president of OU (and faggot), who was pressured by the
monied assholes, who were siced on me by Jay Wilkinson, who didn't like the
things I wrote about his father, which, the way, are true.

     My brothers were wonderful this weekend, in spite of the fact that
Woody heckled me during my speech, and Grumbles tried to hustle my best
Sunday girl. I guess Woody had a right. He drove all the way from Atlanta,
then had to turn around drive back to Dallas after the party. But, Woody,
you still owe me for conspiring with Hutch to shut me out of the Beta
offense.

    Back to Hess. My most humble apology. (I have sent a personal email to
Hess). I thought everyone knew that the party had moved, but, as it turned
out, he slipped through the cracks. I put a notice on the Beta wire about
the change and signs were posted at the Sam Noble Museum. By by the time
Hess arrived, the place was dark and closed. Sorry brother Hess. I will make
it up to you somehow.

    Guys, you are the greatest, and the best friends I've ever had in my
life.

Brother Del Dent

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Jeff:

it was great to see Rebecca and you last night. I was sorry to hear about
your water damage, but thankfully it stayed out of the house. I am
attaching some stuff about the trip to Spain, that you might find useful.
You will find quite a bit of it in your Spain guide. Furthermore, I am
going to start thinking about a diving trip to the Caribbean in November.
You need to take about five days to make it worth while ( you can't dive on
the last day, on account of nitrogen levels in your blood stream). It will
be up to you to get certified in the meantime. The way I would do it (and
actually did) is to go to the Presidente Intercontinental in Cozumel and go
to their dive shop, Scuba Doo, for a three-day course.

I am scheduled to hear from the firm about my partnership election over the
next couple of days. I'll let you know what happens, one way or another. By
the way, I put your name on a list of references, so they might have
called. If they did, many thanks for taking the time and forgive me for not
telling you in advance.

All the best,

Pedro

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"The Morning Market Call - Monday October 1st, 2001.","
			Good Monday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The Federal Reserve meets again tomorrow. The wide consensus is that they
will lower short-term interest rates again by 50 basis points.

At this stage, the markets have factored in a virtual halt in the economy
and consumer spending. There is no good news that anyone is anticipating.
Often, the consensus is wrong. In fact, it seems that the low in consumer
sentiment has coincided with major lows in the market. Over the last 15
months, inventory levels have declined significantly. There has also been a
great deal of fiscal and monetary stimulation. The dollar is strong. The
markets may react more positively to any unexpected good news than anyone
anticipates.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.37%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.54%.
The 5-year is trading at 3.76%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $23.15 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.22 p/mcf

IMPACT CALLS

Banks 		Jason Goldberg
MidCapBanks: Where We Stand & 3Q Preview
q Companies with liability sensitive balance sheets, mortgage banking
operations and better
""mousetraps"" should do relatively better in the current uncertain
environment. We are concerned
with syndicated lending, consumer/sub-prime lending, asset sensitive balance
sheets and market
sensitive revenues.
q We are looking for 3Q01 upside surprises from TCB, NFB, SOTR, NCF, FTN and
CBH. In addition to
CFR, which pre-announced, we are concerned with ASO, FMER, GBBK, PFGI and
UB.
q We continue to like the business models of CYN, CBH, MTB, NFB, and TCB. We
believe the current
valuations of CBSS, CFR and ZION are disconnected from their franchise value
and like those names as
well. We view WABC as good defensive play, and UPC has other earnings levers
to pull in a difficult
environment.
q We expect the mid-cap banks to begin reporting 3Q01 EPS on October 9. The
median bank is expected
to increase EPS 10% linked quarter (annualized) and 7% year-over-year.
q This quarter, we expect 31 of the 35 banks in our mid-cap universe to meet
or exceed consensus
expectations. This compares to 31 banks in 2Q01 and 27 in 1Q01.

Brokers & Asset Managers 		Mark Constant
Revised Earnings Models for Sept.
q In anticipation of upcoming 3Q earnings releases, we are reducing our
official earnings forecasts
for all of the Asset Managers in our coverage universe, to reflect the
dramatic reduction in the
market value of equity assets under management (and, therefore, run-rate fee
income) since our
most recent formal model revisions for these companies (generally, following
2Q earnings releases
in late July). In order to make our forecasts comparable with the Brokers
who recently reported
their F3Q (ended 31-Aug) earnings, we are also updating our estimates for
Charles Schwab (SCH,
$11.50, 3-Market Perform) and Merrill Lynch (MER, $40.60, 1-Strong Buy), to
reflect recent
global/market developments that have impacted them as well.
q These changes are consistent with comments we have made in several recent
notes, and should not come
as a surprise to many observers, as periodic estimate revisions such as
these are a ""fact of life"" in this
market-sensitive sector (we could arguably revise earnings forecasts for
some companies as often as
several times a week). We prefer to spend our time trying to identify
unanticipated fundamental catalysts
and valuation opportunities, and continue to view market-driven estimate
revisions as largely reactionary
and perpetually belated (i.e., estimates have their greatest utility when
viewed as a ""point in time"" metric).


Leisure Felicia		 Rae Kantor
Lehman Leisure Sensitivity Tool Kit
q Given the uncertain operating environment, we thought it would be useful
to create a tool that
could hone in on potential opportunities in our sector and avoid possible
value traps. This note
summarizes our forthcoming 70-page report entitled, The Lehman Leisure
Ledger.
q We found that the cruise industry still demonstrates the most risk,
despite current valuations. Recession,
travel fears and oversupply do not provide a robust backdrop for price
increases. Our worst-case scenario
illustrates over 40% downside.
q ERTS' risk profile is also not favorable, esp if the consumer balks at
prices this Xmas. EA.com also
continues to be a risk.
q HAS falls into the 2nd tier of our risk profile. We see a floor of $12.
Leverage to low-priced toys and must-see
movies reduce risk.
q We believe the ski cos likely already discount economic and travel-related
risk. Separately, we are
adjusting our price targets to more accurately reflect risk valuations: IDR
to $19 from $23 and MTN to $20
from $25.
q HDI could outperform the sector with worst-case downside of 9%. Sales of
P&A and gen mdse could slow,
but we believe that the 100th anniv could bolster sales as passion replaces
necessity. We are adjusting
our price target to $50 from $60, reflecting a more realistic premium to the
mkt multiple.


INITIATING COVERAGE
Patterson Dental		 Lawrence Marsh
Initiation of Coverage 1 - Strong Buy / 34.07 (USD)
q We are initiating coverage of Patterson Dental with a 1 - Strong Buy
recommendation and a price
target of $43
q We view PDCO to be the gold standard in the dental products & equipment
distr. industry, w/ a stellar
record & very good prospects, one of our two defined ""safety stocks"" in the
recession-resistant dental
business.
q PDCO is a product of a very success. 1985 LBO, best impl. & inspired by
CEO Pete Freschette, w/ 10 yr.
CGR in sales of 15% & in EPS of 18%.
q The 4 keys to our call: 1) cont. solid expansion of share in a steady
growing bus; 2) better acq. Environ. w/
fewer alt. for smaller co's 3) scale opps. W/ recently-acq Webster in
dental; 4) boost in growth in FY03 w/
FAS142 and margin exp.
q Our target is 27x cash C02; 1.3x growth rate.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE

Wireless Services		 John Bensche
Location Update - Where Are We?
q Given the tragic events of Sept. 11, Americans are more focused on safety
and communications.
We think the first wireless carriers to offer E-911 capabilities could gain
market share over their
competitors. In terms of ability to roll out services near term, we rank the
carriers in the following
order: Sprint PCS, Cingular, AT&T Wireless, Verizon Wireless, VoiceStream,
and Nextel.
q No U.S. carriers will be compliant with today's deadline for the FCC's
Phase II location services mandate.
All have sought waivers, however, we think the FCC is focused more on seeing
evidence that carriers are
making progress on the location front, rather than on the deadlines
themselves.
q Due to the incident on Sept. 11, we would not be surprised to see an
accelerated pace of contract signings
as carriers seek to demonstrate their responsiveness to safety concerns.

Lilly Eli		 Charles Butler
Searching for the Angles - Visit to LLY 2 - Buy / (USD)
q We remain quite bullish on the long term prospects for Eli Lilly. With 10
products to file over the
next three years, Lilly is likely to have the best revenue and earnings
appreciation in all of the
pharmaceutical group.
q We met with senior executives of Eli Lilly last Friday. Below we highlight
comments from each. The key to
the stock in the near term remains the Xigris panel outcome (October 16,
Will the label be restricted?) and
the outlook for earnings in 2002.

Temple-Inland Inc		 Peter Ruschmeier
TIN to acquire GCR 2 - Buy / 45.90 (USD)
q Combining recent weakness on shares of TIN with significant accretion from
their planned
acquisition of GCR, we are reiterating our Buy rating on Shares of TIN.
q TIN announced plans to pay $786 MM for GCR, including $1.80 for the equity
and $686 MM for the public
and bank debt. Given GCR's distressed situation, TIN is able to buy the
enterprise for a 22% discount to
it's recent value.
q On a VERY conservative basis, we estimate $35 MM of interest savings and
$25 MM of operating
synergies which should add $7/share of value for TIN shareholders.
q We estimate 16% accretion to mid-cycle cash EPS w/o synergies and 25%
accretion with $60 MM of
synergies.
q We are reiterating our Buy with a 12-month target of $67.

Gaming & Lodging		 Joyce Minor
Cut Ests, So Can You, Model Available
q We are lowering our 2H01 and 2002 lodging estimates to reflect our best
guess as to the impact of
the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Our new estimates assume that travel trends
continue to gradually
improve from unbelievably horrible (-62% RevPAR week ending 9/11) to really
ugly (-25% in 4Q01)
to still pretty bad (-15% in 1Q02, -10% in 2Q02). We assume trends bounce
back against very easy
comparisons to +10% in 3Q02 and +15% in 4Q02. This assumed trend produces
painful revisions
to our estimates, with 2002 EBITDA down about -15% to -20% for most from our
prior estimates,
and with EPS or FFO/share down -20% to -50%. Fortunately, we believe
investors will eventually
decide that 2002 estimates are an anomaly and irrelevant for valuation
purposes. While lodging
stocks rebounded to varying degrees last week (ended 9/28), as we see
additional data points
suggesting a gradual recovery we expect the stocks will see further upside.
We see the most near-term
opportunity in MeriStar Hospitality (MHX) and Marriott International (MAR).
q Total Enterprise Values (TEVs) have declined -15% or so since 9/10 for
most companies on what we
project as -20% or so 2002 EBITDA declines. Marriott International's TEV is
down -15% like the group,
while we expect 2002 EBITDA will be down -14%, or less than the group.
Similarly, MeriStar Hospitality's
TEV is down an overly severe -18% since 9/10.


Arch Coal			 Peter Ward
Adjusting Earnings Estimates 1 - Strong Buy / 15.60 (USD)
q Based on company guidance, we are adjusting our 2001 quarterly estimates
for Arch Coal.
Importantly, there is no change in our annual estimates at this time. 3Q is
typically the weakest
quarter for coal mining companies due to slow demand and miner vacations.
q We estimate about 95% of Arch's 2002 production has been contracted. Those
tons contracted in 2001
(about 25% of 2002 volumes so far) have likely been locked up at
substantially higher prices than those
realized in 2001. Investors need to keep in mind that realized coal prices
tend to lag coal fundamentals by
1 to 2 years.
q With a 2002 P/E of 7 and EV/EBITDA of 3.5, we believe these shares
represent excellent value.

Massey Energy 		Peter Ward
Preannounces 4Q Earnings; Reiterate Buy 2 - Buy / 14.60 (USD)
q Massey Energy preannounced last week that fiscal 4Q results would fall
below its initial EPS
guidance of $0.20 to $0.26. The company is now forecasting EPS of $0.04 to
$0.10 in the quarter
ending October 31.
q We are reducing our fiscal 4Q estimate from $0.12 to $0.07. The company's
initial guidance had included
an anticipated asset sale gain that has been delayed. We had never
considered the pending asset sale
representative of earnings from continuing operations. Therefore, this
disappointment is much more
modest than it initially appeared on Wednesday.
q The company reaffirmed its guidance for fiscal 02 EBITDA of between $400
and $460 million. With a P/E
of 8 and an EV/EBITDA of 3.5, we believe these shares represent excellent
value.

Ferrellgas Partners		 Richard Gross
F4Q01 Earnings In Line 2 - Buy / 18.80 (USD)
q We reiterate our 2-Buy rating and our price target of $22. Our price
target is based on a cash
distribution of $2.00 and a yield of 9%.
q FGP results of a loss of $1.38 were largely in line with our expectations.
As a reminder, FGP typically
experiences a loss in the fourth quarter due to the warmer weather. FGP,
along with its peer propane
MLP's, earns the bulk (60%-70%) of its cash during the heating season from
October to April.

Oil & Gas: E&P - Canada 	Thomas R. Driscoll
Canadian Natural Gas Insight
q ? We estimate that Canadian natural gas production in August was 6%, or
0.9 Bcfpd, above year-ago
levels. We believe that the large year-over year increase in Canadian gas
production has led to
rapidly rising exports to the US and has contributed to weakening natural
gas prices in both the US
and Canada this year.
q Canadian natural gas production in August fell 0.1 Bcfpd from July levels
to 15.5 Bcfpd. However, this
production level is 6%, or 0.9 Bcfpd, above year-ago levels.
q We believe that natural gas production in Canada could be nearly 10% above
year ago levels by the end
of 2001.
q Production fell unusually sharp from August to December last year (2.4%).
This 2.4% decline from August
to December of 2000 compared to growth of about 3.0% over the same period in
1998 and flat production
over the period in 1999.
q We expect that the addition of over 200 MMcfpd of additional gas from
Ladyfern later this year could
contribute to flat-to-rising Canadian natural gas production over the
remainder of this year.

Exelon Corp		 Daniel Ford
Reiterating Our Buy Rating 2 - Buy / 44.50 (USD)
q Yesterday, EXC signaled 2001 EPS would likely fall 2-5% short of guidance
due to weaker energy
prices prompting a 12% sell-off (20% since 9/11). We reiterate our 2-Buy
rating and our target is
$54 which is 10.2x our revised $5.27 2002E.
q We are lowering our 2001 EPS outlook $0.16/share to $4.39 due to weaker
power prices, economic
slowdown, and a $0.07/share telecom write-off.
q We also lowered our 2002 forecast $0.33/share to $5.27. Specifics are: 1)
Weaker forward power prices (-$
0.21/share) and 2) 0% sales growth (-$0.12/share).
q EXC also set Q3 EPS at $1.10-$1.20 versus $1.27 pro-forma in 2000 and
raised layoffs by 450 people.
q The sell-off leaves EXC trading at 8.4x our revised 2002E or a 20% utility
group discount.

Mellon Financial 		Henry Chip Dickson
Third Quarter Preview 2 - Buy / 31.70 (USD)
q We expect MEL to report 3Q01 results of $0.38, which is $0.05 in line with
consensus expectations.
For 2001, we are lowering our estimate $0.10 to $1.70 anticipating a down
fourth quarter. For 2002,
our estimate is $2.00 on a new GAAP basis, which equals $1.85 on an old GAAP
basis, or a $0.10
reduction of our estimate. We continue to rate MEL 2 - Buy.
q We expect market driven revenues to decline this quarter, given the
decline of most global markets.
q Our estimates reflect continuing operations.

Bank of New York 		Henry Chip Dickson
3Q01 Preview - Further Details 1 - Strong Buy / 35.00 (USD)
q We rate BK 1 - Strong Buy. Its growth drivers are different than most
other large cap financial
institutions. It is more sensitive to market volumes than market levels.
Actions taken to enhance
market liquidity and improve economic conditions should be reflected first
by a sustained increase
in market volumes and therefore, BK's EPS growth rates should improve before
most other large
cap financial services companies.
q BK estimated losses caused by WTC Tragedy at $125mm. Mgmt believes most,
if not all, costs will be
covered by insurance.
q If Tragedy had not happened, mgmt believes BK would have at least met
consensus of $0.52. So, the
weak market conditions cost BK at least $0.02 of EPS growth. Credit costs do
not appear to have risen
dramatically.

Compass Bancshares 		Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Resolution 1 - Strong Buy / 24.82 (USD)
q We rate CBSS 1 - Strong Buy with a $34 price target. We continue to like
CBSS due to its attractive
valuation, improving operating leverage and asset quality, and franchise
value.
q We expect CBSS to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.53 on October 16.
q We expect on-target results to evidence continued loan growth, a stable
net interest margin, further fee
income expansion and improved operating leverage.
q We expect one large $28 million nonperforming credit, which totals
one-third of total NPAs, to be resolved
this quarter. Management expects to foreclose on this property in 3Q01,
bringing it a step closer to
resolution.
q Towards the end of August, CBSS announced a 5% repurchase program.

Mortgage Finance		 Bruce Harting
Houisng Mkt & FNM, FRE; 3Q Preview
q FNM and FRE are very well positioned to report strong 3Q earnings.
Further, we believe 4Q can be
even stronger. The housing market continues to show resilience, and the
GSEs' earnings visibility
in 2002 is very solid. We recommend FNM and FRE based on their strong
fundamentals and
attractive valuation, especially in the current market environment where
""visibility"" is very hard to
come by.
q FNM should report its earnings during the week of 10/8. Our estimate is
$1.33 vs. the consensus estimate
of $1.32. FRE should report during the week of 10/15. Our estimate is $1.07,
the same as the consensus.

Cendant Corp 		Jeffrey Kessler
Guidance Better Than Exp; Reit 1-SB 1 - Strong Buy / 12.80 (USD)
q On Friday, Cendant management provided updated financial guidance to
reflect the affects of the
WTC tragedy on its businesses. While we are reducing our estimates, the new
guidance is
substantially better than the worst case scenario many investors had feared.
We believe that
management's assumptions are reasonable, and would be aggressive buyers of
CD shares, trading
at only 11x our new 2002 EPS estimate of $1.15.
q In the wake of the share price decline, CD provided a positive update on
its balance sheet strength,
including plans to reduce its debt by over $1B during the next few weeks.
q Cendant plans to close both the Galileo and Cheap Tickets acquisitions
this week, and, contrary to many
people's fears of dilution, announced that the acquisitions should still be
nicely accretive to 2002 EPS (by
$0.07-$0.09).

Business & Professional Services		 Adam Waldo
Business & Professional Services Weekly
q VVI and WSTC preannounced 3Q01 results last week. Top picks remain the low
economic
sensitivity ""defensives"": ASF, ASGN, MMS, PAYX, VVI, WSTC.
q We cut our 3Q01 and 4Q01 EPS estimates for Viad, and reduced our one-year,
DCF-derived price target
from $36 to $34.
q We also cut our 3Q01 and 4Q01 EPS estimates for West Corp., and reiterated
our 2 Buy rating with a one-year
price target of $41.

Safeway Inc 		Meredith Adler
Reported 3Q of $0.60 1 - Strong Buy / 39.72 (USD)
q Safeway remains, in our opinion, an extremely well-managed company that
has substantially
improved its franchise value in recent years through initiatives to improve
efficiency at the stores
and lower the cost of product, while making a number of accretive
acquisitions. Current valuation,
which is close to an 8-year low, does not reflect these improvements.
q SWY reported adjusted 3Q01 EPS of $0.60, $0.01 below our estimate but in
line with consensus, with
strong improvements in gross margins and an 0.8% identical-store sales
increase, slightly weaker than the
1.2% we had expected.
q We are maintaining our 4Q01 estimate at $0.81, but lowering our FY01
estimate to $2.59 to reflect the
$0.01 miss in 3Q01. FY02 EPS remains unchanged at $2.98.

"Important update on your NewPower service","September 13, 2001

Dear JEFFREY SKILLING:

We are writing to you (and the thousands of other Texas households who
have chosen NewPower as their new Retail Electric Provider) to keep
you informed on the latest developments in the Texas Electric Choice
Pilot program. There have been delays in implementing the Texas
Electric Choice Pilot program, but none of these delays are going to
ultimately prevent NewPower from using our energy expertise to deliver
savings on electricity to our customers.  Nor will they prevent your
local utility from providing the same reliable service.

Here is the latest information from the Public Utility Commission of
Texas (PUCT):

1.  After several delays, we are pleased to announce the Electric
Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) began processing switch requests
to NewPower on July 31, 2001.
2.  Unfortunately, the switch requests are being processed by
ERCOT at a much slower pace than originally promised.
3.  As a result, based on past experience, NewPower has been given
estimates that your actual switch date could take place anytime
between now and November 2001.

NewPower must comply with the revised ERCOT timetable.  We can't
supply you with electricity until ERCOT processes the switch request.
But here's what we can do:

1.  First and foremost, we want to assure you that we are
committed to providing the stability and value you were promised when
you signed up with NewPower for electricity supply... despite these
delays.
2.  As soon as your switch request is processed by ERCOT, we'll
send you a welcome letter notifying you that your service has been
switched to NewPower
3.  In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to encourage
ERCOT to process your switch request more quickly so that you can
receive the savings you expect from NewPower as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or concerns, please visit the Public Utility
Commission's website at
http://www.powertochoose.org
or call NewPower at 1-877-819-9817.


Regards,

Nick Utton

 Charles Schwab  [IMAGE] Morning Market View Email Alert [IMAGE] For Friday, August 24, 2001 as of 9:30AM EDT  Information provided by Schwab Center for Investment Research  Login        Also In This Issue:    Treasury and Economic Summary    World Markets    Futures Watch          QUICK QUOTE  Please Enter Stock Symbol:         MARKETS LOOK TO START FRIDAY IN THE GREEN   Equity index futures are off of earlier highs, but still remain firmly to the upside. Positive developments in the technology sector are lifting investors' spirits this morning, despite weaker-than-expected durable goods orders data.  Durable goods data released by the Commerce Department suggest continued weakness in the U.S. economy. The weaker-than-expected numbers were the lowest since 1998 and would have been worse were it not for a pickup in orders for cars.  Technology shares are likely to open higher today after Cisco Systems (CSCO,16.76f1) CEO John Chambers reported that the first few weeks of the quarter are meeting the company's forecasts and that he was ""pleased so far with August."" Chambers hinted that business conditions are stabilizing, even though the company had previously said that it expected sales to be unchanged to down 5% for the quarter. The company also reported that it would restructure and centralize its operations as it eliminates three of its telecommunications divisions. Additionally, the chief of telecommunications-products is resigning.  Software issues could also get a boost after Microsoft Corp. (MSFT,59f1) said that it has completed its new Windows XP operating system and will present the final version to computer manufacturers on Friday, even as the company grapples with anti-trust concerns in the courts and relentless adversarial pressure to implement changes in the product.  Telecommunications equipment maker ADC Telecom (ADCT,4.27f1) reported a 3Q pro-forma loss of $0.05/share, $0.01 better than the First Call consensus estimate, on a 39% decrease in sales. The company warned that it expects a 4Q pro-forma loss of $0.03 per share, $0.01 lower than analysts' estimates, and failed to provide fiscal 2002 earnings per share guidance due to uncertainty surrounding the economic slowdown and market conditions.  Return to  TOP      TREASURY AND ECONOMIC SUMMARY   Bonds, which appear to be taking cues from the stock market, had a muted reaction to the durable goods orders release this morning, rising just slightly off of morning lows as the volatility-plagued numbers suggest continued economic weakness. According to the Commerce Department, total orders for July declined 0.6% to $182 billion, worse than the Dow Jones Newswires forecast of $183 billion. June's numbers were revised much lower, down 2.6% from the previously reported 1.7% decline. Excluding transportation, orders fell 1.4%. Orders for autos and auto-parts rose 3.8% and communications orders rose 18.3%, while semiconductor orders dropped 26%.  Return to  TOP      WORLD MARKETS   European markets were trading firmly in positive territory after a German Consumer Price Index report indicated that import and factory orders prices fell more than expected in August as oil and food prices dropped. Inflationary pressures in the euro-zone continue to abate, fueling speculation that the European Central Bank will cut interest rates at next Thursday's policy meeting. The Bloomberg European 500 Index was up 1.03% as of 8:54 a.m. EDT with telecommunication services stocks leading the way, buoyed by Cisco's upbeat report. The euro was weaker against the U.S. dollar, as traders booked profits going into the weekend on light volume in front of the UK's banking holiday on Monday.  Asian markets were mixed, with Japan's Nikkei-225 Index closing up 0.35% as bargain-hunters sought attractive technology stocks, which reversed earlier losses following the Cisco news. The dollar climbed against the yen, and crude oil prices increased slightly as refinery outages in the U.S. exacerbated concerns about lower inventory levels overall.  Return to  TOP      FUTURES WATCH   In the September Globex futures contract as of 8:54 a.m. EDT, the S&P 500 Index was up 5 points, or 4 points above fair value, while the Nasdaq 100 Index was up 23 points, or 24 points above fair value. The September DJIA futures contract was higher by 31 points, or 32 points above fair value, and the October crude oil futures traded on the NYMEX were up $0.02 at $26.65/barrel.

"ELM Finance Course Offerings","
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

It has come to my  attention that either our YahooGroup is not working, 
or you are not  communicating.  So this message is a Search for 
ExtraTerrestial  Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this 
august group. I will  even count terrestial intelligence this time.
What with Homecoming only  5 days away, we figured there would be some

Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there  is life

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"Do You Seek Payoff From Your Firm's Technology Spending?              Forrester Can Help!","

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

    Thursday, October 04, 2001 Issue 38   EDITORIAL  A Focus on the latest developments in Europe Today's briefing takes a look at what's going on in the European energy marketplace.  It's been an interesting year...deregulation, new regulation on renewables, the IPE bought out by the ICE, American energy companies staking their claims and European companies crossing the pond.  With all the articles written about California's failed experiment with deregulation, little attention has been focused on how the European countries have faired in their move to more deregulated markets.  And just like in the US, the changes in the European market offer a number of opportunities for companies providing new developments in billing and CRM software, trading solutions, and communications.  Two articles below take a look at the state of play in Europe. This also gives us the opportunity to announce our new European conferences.  We'll be bringing the successful Energy Exchanges Online event over to Europe, as well as co-locating it with 2 other events:  Weather Trading 2002  and Emissions Trading 2002 , to provide delegates with the most comprehensive trading event in Europe.

Such is the case of today's utilities market as companies face increased demands for profits from shareholders while consumers are keenly aware of choices brought on by deregulation and increased competition.  It is a harsh environment for an industry accustomed to operating in an inflexible, monopolistic manner. The information age has spawned a more knowledgeable, more demanding consumer, forcing modern utilities to adapt quickly to change, and forge new alliances, in some cases with old enemies, through... Click here for Full Story    INSIGHT   EU Deregulation: Out of Chaos Comes Order   The European Union is moving quickly toward deregulating and privatizing electrical utilities. The move will allow power companies to sell electricity throughout the Union and will give consumers more choice about where they get their power and how much they pay for it.  Regulation, Deregulation and Reregulation At its core there is really no such thing as deregulation. There is simply the re-regulation of old economies and sectors. That is the state of affairs as Europe continues its somewhat rocky march to energy deregulation. Restructuring, privatization...

Today's LA Times editorial  revived the Lockyer quote.  It is remarkable (and troubling for Enron)  that Lockyer's political peers / rivals have not taken  him to task for his outrageous remark; nor have the major  newspapers.  In Today's editorial, the usually conservative LA Times  refers to Lockyer as having ""boosted the rhetoric a notch.""  (I'd hate  to witness two or three notches.)
 
This lack of  criticism could foreshadow a contagious attitude that powerful Enron is in  fact the one to blame (facts be damned).  Given Enron's high profile policy  and fundraising ties to the Bush administration and Governor Gray  Davis' war with President Bush and Texas energy companies, there could be  more turbulence ahead.  Fasten your seatbelts and be on the  ready.

Admit it: The only  comic relief in this energy crisis has been watching our leaders go at  suppliers and each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer guests.        In his State of the State address last  January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the big private electric power generators  of legalized highway robbery and threatened to seize their plants if  necessary. Then he really got angry, calling them ""the biggest snakes in  the world."" This past week, Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer boosted the rhetoric a  notch by declaring he would like to personally escort the chairman of  Enron Corp. ""to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude  who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.""' Meanwhile, President Bush and  Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed California for causing its own  problems with a ""harebrained"" deregulation scheme and mocked the state's  power purchases and conservation programs. It's been fun. Now it's time  for our leaders to act like adults.        Davis and Bush always will have their  political differences, but the economies of both the state and the nation  are endangered by California's energy situation. These leaders need to  work together as cooperatively as possible, starting next week when Bush  makes his first visit to California as president.        Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to  meet with him during his California visit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer  said the president looks forward to discussing energy and other issues.  Good start. Let's hope the conversation is civil and that the civility  spreads.       No matter how much California  has been abused by the power companies, and it absolutely has, the state  still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by shortages of electric  power generation this year and next. Usually, the biggest targets of  official and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities such as  Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not this  time because, in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry  by the power generators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over  the purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more  credit to Edison and PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the  threatening rhetoric needs to subside.        State lawmakers are right to be upset  with the White House for refusing to use its authority to set reasonable  temporary wholesale price controls. And Davis is justifiably upset with  Bush and with Cheney, who said the only solution was to build more power  plants--ignoring the fact that the state is building 10 plants now, with  five more on the way, and that the only way to control wholesale power  rates is for Washington to cap them.       If  the state hadn't bought the power, the generators would have let the  lights go out. Davis needs to deliver that message, quietly and  persuasively, while Bush is in California. And Bush needs to listen  respectfully, like an adult.   [IMAGE]Search the archives  of the Los  Angeles Times for similar stories.

Brother Beta's:  Last night we had a GREAT Beta gathering here in Atlanta.
The pictures were taken at John Miller's house.  In attendance:   Beta's
John Miller, Randall Harman, John Grumbles, and Mark Hillstrom and myself.
We also had Rita Harman and their two kids, Meredith and Kyle, Woody's 2
sons, Matt and Adam, as well as Mark Hillstrom's son, Ryan. Mark's son was
in Atlanta to play in the U.S. Amateur golf championship.

We feasted on Woody's great ribs and his Awesome Woody Blossom and drank a
few too many beers (you can't see us singing in a couple of the pictures but
we did!!)  Foosball was one of the activities, as was a phone call to Phil
and Annie Morrow in Rockford, Il.  The picture of John Miller is NOT with
his wife, April; it's with Randall Harman's daughter, Meredith.

Some things never change (thank God and Wooglin), enjoy the pics,

-kai-

Chuck

P.S.  Homecoming is the weekend of October 27th-be there!  Beta tailgating
on campus-what could be better!!

"Invitation to an Executive Breakfast","
Dear Mr. Skilling

Your executive assistant suggested that I email you with my request.  I am
a partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP located in Calgary, Alberta.  On a
recent flight on United Airlines, I read with great interest, the article
in United's in-flight magazine about what you did at Enron with regard to
convergence.  To say the least, I was impressed.  Many of our clients in
the Calgary, particularly in the Energy Industry, are dealing with the
concept of convergence.

The purpose of this email is to ask if you would be a guest speaker at one
of our Executive Breakfasts.  PwC Calgary holds three to four Executive
Breakfasts each year which usually has about 100 ? 150 CEO's, CFO's
attending.  We hold these sessions at the Palliser Hotel and they do a
great job in having an upscale event.

I sincerely believe your ""Enron story"" will interest many of our energy
clients and non-clients.  I would be pleased to discuss this further at
your convenience.  You have my email address or I can be reached at my
Calgary office (403) 509-7530 or residence (403) 241-2930.

Best regards,


Dennis J. Hoffman

The information below is for 1959 graduates.  I think that you mentioned that we were looking for a male, which would make Bill's maiden name question irrelevant.  Let me know if you find the person.  Like I mentioned earlier, I have another idea worth considering if this doesn't work.

Take care,

Billy,

Attached is the additional data.

The names are the current names.  If he is looking for a woman, I would have
to also ask for ""original"" name as well but this may not be necessary.  Let
me know if you can determine the sex.

I look forward to meeting you when you come to town and no you really don't
have to buy me lunch.  This is really a fun place to work.........

Brothers,
It has come to my attention that either our YahooGroup is not working,
or you are not communicating.  So this message is a Search for
ExtraTerrestial Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this
august group. I will even count terrestial intelligence this time.

What with Homecoming only 5 days away, we figured there would be some

Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there is life

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's

"One other thing.","One thing I forgot to mention this afternoon. I have recently gone on the
board of Kimberly Clark (Kleenex, etc). They are a heavy user of both power
and gas in their manufacturing operations, and it hurt their 1Q results. I
have been telling then that they should start a conversation with Enron
relative to outsourcing the management of this.
   As it happens, they have a pulp plant they want to sell, and your guys
have an interest to help their trading operation. In the discussions on the
pulp plant, don't overlook the opportunity to bundle together a proposal on
outsourcing the energy management. Let me know if I can help.
  Thanks for your attention to our problem.

"Solar Migration - Second Notice","
	During the weekend of October 6 and 7, 2001 the Enterprise Storage Team will be migrating all production users off the current hardware (Solar) that houses their home and application directories (no production databases are effected) to new hardware.	

	This migration requires a total system outage of approximately 4 hours.  The outage will occur Friday night - Saturday morning between the hours of Midnight to 4:00 AM.  All users will need to be logged off during this time period.  If this is not possible, contact Adam DeRidder (x3-1428) or Carlos Uribe (x5-8179) as soon as possible.
	In order to validate the migration, production users need to test access to their home directories and applications on Saturday, October 7 and Sunday, October 8, 2001.

	As part of the migration plan, the Storage Team needs volunteers from the production community to test the new environment.  The test will only require approximately 15-30 minutes to complete.  Adam DeRidder and Carlos Uribe have setup a test lab on the 34th floor for this purpose.  Contact Adam to setup a time.  Your involvement will help make this a successful migration.

	A list of contacts will be made available on Thursday, October 5, 2001.  Please use this list to report issues and check the status of the migration.

"LET'S FLY HOME !!","Hey TEAM!  Here's a great offer from Bill LaFuze, Vinson & Elkins, Team Enron's  newest team member.  He's made this offer to the team:  He wants to save two of you tired riders from the long ride home by offering a seat on his private airplane. 

Read on, and let me know if you're interested:  

""I am an instument rated pilot (am working on a commercial rating and have passed the commercial written test), and own an airplane (Cessna 210Turbo). I am willing to make this challenge to the Enron team.""

""In order to avoid the long, and perhaps dreary bus ride back to Houston, I now intend to have my airplane flown to Austin to pick me up and can offer seats to the two Enron teammembers who raise the most pledge money for MS, who make it to Austin, and who are willing to travel in a 6 seater private aircraft. Travel time is about 47 minutes to Sugarland airport where my plane is based.  I can make a stop at West Houston airport (I10 and Hwy 6) for the convenience of anyone who might prefer that destination. Sorry, my plane does not have an external bike rack, nor adequate room in the luggage compartment, so bikes would still need to come back by bus.""

THANKS BILL !!

"[smu-betas] keep on the lookout for Geoff Anderson","
Just wanted to let you guys know that Geoff unsubscribed from our
Betas yahoogroup today. He did not re-subscribe with another email
address.  I'm only speculating now, but his email address was with
TWA and we know that TWA was acquired by American Airlines, and the
airlines are a mess right now.  So, if you know of any other contact
addresses with Geoff, get in touch with him and let us know how we
can keep him in the loop. Geoff spent many years in the USAF, so
hopefully he's not heading into some covert operation in Afghanistan.

stay in touch with the brothers.

Enron Beats Analysts' Expectations
Energy Company Enron Reports Earnings Increase of Almost 40 Percent in  Second Quarter
HOUSTON (AP) -- Enron Corp. (NYSE:ENE  - news ) reported a nearly 40 percent increase in  second-quarter earnings on Thursday and beat analysts' expectations due to  robust growth in its power marketing and energy management businesses in the  United States and Europe.
	


The Houston-based energy wholesaler and retailer earned $404 million for the  quarter ended June 30, or 45 cents per share. That compared with $289 million,  or 34 cents per share a year earlier.  
Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call predicted earnings of 42  cents per share.  
Despite continued growth in its natural gas and electricity trading business,  though, Enron's stock has faltered in the past year due to unmet expectations  for its high-speed Internet business.  
Enron's broadband business reported a $102 million loss, compared with an $8  million loss for the same quarter a year ago.  
Enron President and Chief Executive Jeff Skilling said Enron would  ``significantly'' reduce spending in its broadband unit ``to match the reduced  revenue opportunities currently available.''  
Enron reported $50.1 billion in revenue for the second quarter of 2001,  almost triple the $16.9 billion reported for the same quarter a year ago.  Company officials expressed confidence of reaching $1.80 per share in earnings  for the full year 2001 and $2.15 per share for 2002.  
``Our wholesale and retail energy businesses continue to dramatically expand  business activity and increase profitability,'' said Skilling.  
Enron has been embroiled in the conflict over California's energy woes, with  a committee of that state's Senate issuing subpoenas to the corporation and  other generating companies earlier this year in connection with an investigation  of possible price manipulation in energy markets.  
Shares of Enron rose 45 cents to close at $49.55 on the New York Stock  Exchange Thursday. Enron's stock was trading above $70-a-share at this time last  year.

"The Morning Market Call - Friday Sept 28th, 2001.","
			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

We read a great quote today. It was published by a technical newsletter
which we are privileged to receive.

""When people are emotional, it is difficult to envision a market environment
that is opposite of what is making them so emotional in the first place"" -
Unknown..

We believe the market is in the early stages of repair. While we may have a
rally over the next few weeks, we are on the lookout for a successful retest
of the mid-September lows. If this were to occur, we would expect to see
this coincide with positive technical market readings.

What to do in the mean time?. This is the time to upgrade portfolios in
anticipation of a longer term recovery.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.50%.

IMPACT CALLS

Textiles; Apparel & Footwear Robert Drbul
Wait for the Sale
q Given the current uncertain economic climate, we believe that footwear and
apparel vendors face a
high degree of risk related to three issues: 1) probable order
cancellations; 2) lower than expected
reorder business; and 3) direct retail exposure through their own stores.
The timing of this
economic downturn is coming at a very inopportune time for footwear and
apparel vendors as
goods have already been shipped for fall/holiday 2001. All three issues will
lead to excess
inventory levels and in turn significant markdown exposure for all footwear
and apparel vendors
both at department stores and company owned retail stores.
q We are lowering many of our ratings to reflect both our lowered earnings
expectations as well as our belief
that many of the companies in our universe have further downside from
current levels. Overall, we have
reduced our average top-line estimate by 3% for 2001 and 2% for 2002 and our
average EPS estimate by
9% in 2001 and 11% in 2002. We have reduced our average 2H01 top-line
estimate by 5.5% and our
average 2H01 EPS estimate by 17%. Our new earnings estimates for the
majority of our companies are
considerably below consensus estimates and in many cases by far the lowest
numbers on the street.
While we recognize that the stocks have already depreciated substantially,
we believe that there could be
another leg down as earnings expectations still remain overly optimistic.

Chemicals		 Sergey Vasnetsov
Reducing rating on commodity chem stocks
q We have lowered our ratings on LYO from ""Buy"" to ""Market Perform"" and NCX
from ""Strong Buy""
to ""Buy"" as they are the most leveraged ethylene players.
q We are currently maintaining our EPS estimates, but plan to review them
shortly.
q The recent attacks on the US will have significant, negative effects on
most industries as we forecast
demand to slowdown for at least the next 12 months.
q We expect chemical stocks to be negatively impacted by the volatility in
oil prices and believe the upturn in
the global chemical cycle will be delayed by a few quarters.

Cendant Corp		 Jeffrey Kessler
Thoughts Ahead of the Financial Update 1 - Strong Buy / 11.15 (USD)
q Cendant has announced that it will provide updated guidance tomorrow in a
10:30am conference
call with investors. Ahead of the call, we try to provide a quick
examination of the company's
sensitivity to much lower economic activity and the difficult travel
industry outlook.
q Avis (60% of vehicle services) and the Galileo acquisition clearly pose
the greatest downside earnings risk
because of their sensitivity to airline travel. We see lodging (30% of
hospitality) and real estate brokerage
(35% - 40% of real estate services) as moderately impacted, helped somewhat
by their franchise models.
q Trading at $11.20, Cendant shares seem to imply that the company will earn
$0.70-$0.80 in '02 (assuming
a 14-15x PE multiple). While we will wait for management's guidance, our
initial thoughts are that '02 EPS
are likely to be close to the '01 level, or somewhere around $1.

Advertising & Marketing Services	 Kevin Sullivan
Valuations Still Warrant Caution
q Heightened global economic uncertainty, corporate profit pressures and the
threat of a prolonged
U.S. military strike will continue to weigh on ad/marketing expenditure
growth over the coming
months. While the global ad holding stocks have pulled back some, we remain
cautious on the
group in the near term.
q We are lowering our U.S. ad forecasts following the events of Sept 11th.
We now expect -5% to -6%
growth in '01 vs. our prior forecast of -2.3%. Our '02 projection calls for
just 0 to 1% growth (vs. 2.5%).
q Concurrently, we are lowering our '01/'02 expectations for OMC and IPG,
following LB's revised forecast
for WPP on Sept 19th.
q While valuations have begun to discount these developments, the group is
still trading at 8.0x '02 EBITDA
estimates vs. historical trough forward year multiples of 7-8x in '92-'97
and 6x during the last advertising
recession ('90-'91).
q Growing concerns over a global recession should limit any meaningful
appreciation for the stocks in the
near-term. We will be looking for signs of economic stability and improved
consumer/business confidence
before getting more aggressive around the names.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE

Integrated Oil Jeremy Elden
OPEC under pressure
q Last month, we asserted that commodity prices were past their peak for
this cycle. Since then, oil
prices, US natural gas prices and refining margins have continued to trend
down. Although we
expect ongoing volatility, events of the last two weeks should, if anything,
accelerate the cyclical
decline. This week's OPEC gathering took much longer to reach a common
position than in
previous meetings, highlighting rising pressures as demand and prices fall.
For the next year,
demand will be the biggest price determining factor. Our analysis of history
suggests this will not
be as weak as recent market sentiment suggests.
q OPEC quotas and targets reaffirmed
q Demand hit to be less than market sentiment suggests
q OPEC compliance likely to improve
q Oil price forecasts maintained
q Prices and margins trending down


Exelon 		Daniel F. Ford, CFA
Reiterating Our Buy Rating 2-Buy / $44.50
q Yesterday, EXC signaled 2001 EPS would likely fall 2-5% short of guidance
due to weaker energy
prices prompting a 12% sell-off (20% since 9/11). We reiterate our 2-Buy
rating and our target is
$54 which is 10.2x our revised $5.27 2002E.
q We are lowering our 2001 EPS outlook $0.16/share to $4.39 due to weaker
power prices, economic
slowdown, and a $0.07/share telecom write-off.
q We also lowered our 2002 forecast $0.33/share to $5.27. Specifics are: 1)
Weaker forward power prices (-$
0.21/share) and 2) 0% sales growth (-$0.12/share).
q EXC also set Q3 EPS at $1.10-$1.20 versus $1.27 pro-forma in 2000 and
raised layoffs by 450 people.
q The sell-off leaves EXC trading at 8.4x our revised 2002E or a 20% utility
group discount.
q While M&A risk and weaker EPS growth visibility post-2003 pose concerns,
we believe EXC stock
represents a reasonable risk/reward as: 1) Earnings are mostly regulated
(65% of EBIT); 2) Utility
execution is top decile; and 3) The yield is 3.8%.

Power Daniel Ford
LEHMAN BROTHERS POWER AND UTILITY WEEKLY
q We are previewing the calendar of events for the week of October 1 through
October 5
q On October 3, the Public Utility Commission of Texas is anticipated to
issue its final orders for the
unbundling rate cases of the incumbent utilities including TXU Inc, American
Electric Power and Reliant
Energy.

Bank of America		 Henry Chip Dickson
3Q01 Preview 2 - Buy / 55.75 (USD)
q We expect BAC to report 3Q01 earnings of $1.25. Reflecting the more
difficult operating
environment, we are reducing our 2001 estimate to $4.90 and 2002 estimate to
$5.60, on a new
GAAP basis. With the recent exit of the auto leasing and subprime real
estate, BAC appears to be
in the businesses it wants to be in. We continue to rate BAC 2-Buy.
q Management has been focusing on improving internal performance and the
challenge now is to execute.
We expect to see another quarter of steady confidence building versus
quick-fixes.
q Net interest income should rise, benefiting from greater than expected
rate cuts, while fee income growth
should be modest.
q We continue to expect a challenging credit environment.

JP Morgan Chase & Co		 Eileen Rooney
Earnings Preview 1 - Strong Buy / 32.58 (USD)
q We are lowering our 3Q01 estimate to $0.45 because we expect JPM once
again to have to take an
equity write-down and are assuming about $750 MM. We expect a turn in the
private equity
business to be pushed out and therefore next year's revenues should also
remain well below
trendline. We are reducing our 2001 estimate to $2.15 (-$0.40) and 2002
estimate to $3.60 (-$0.50),
on a new GAAP basis. We are reducing our price target to $50 but staying
with our 1-Strong Buy
rating.
q The current environment weighs on JPM as on other companies because of
market pressures on private
banking, investment banking, investment management and custody and
processing. Our estimates reflect
modest contribution from private equity, weaker capital markets, and higher
credit costs.

KeyCorp		 Eileen Rooney
Third Quarter Preview 3 - Market Perform / (USD)
q Third quarter earnings should reflect efforts to shed high risk and
non-strategic businesses. We
continue to rate Key Corp, 3 -Market Perform with a $27 price target.
q We expect KEY to report 3Q01 results of $0.57, $0.01 below below
consensus. Our 2001 and 2002
estimates are $1.75 and $2.40, respectively.
q For 2001, our operating estimate is now $1.75, a $0.05 reduction. This
assumes less balance sheet
growth, modestly higher credit costs, and lower levels of fee income.
Because we expect these conditions
to continue into 2002, we have lowered our 2002 estimate about $0.12 and on
a new GAAP basis we
believe KEY will earn $2.40.
q Third quarter earnings should be impacted by KEY's new strategic
initiatives announced in the middle of
May.

Mercantile Bankshares		 Kristin Nemec
Third Quarter Preview 3 - Market Perform / 39.00 (USD)
q MRBK should report October 15th. Unlike last quarter, where the company
pre-released lower than
expected results due to a sharp, 25 bp decline in the margin, we believe
there will be no fireworks
this qtr. 3 - Market Perform.
q We expect the margin, which was 4.84% in Q2 to remain under pressure and
drop by 10+ bps.
q Balance sheet trends should be mixed and we would not be surprised by a
decline in loan growth to
around 6% from 8%, given the industry trend of relatively high prepayments
and borrowers that are often
trying to pay down lines.
q Fee growth should be good, particularly on an annual basis with another
strong qtr from mortgage banking,
but maybe not as high as Q2.
q Expenses should be another strongpoint with incentive fees in the mortgage
banking area potentially offset
by lower directors fees in the form of deferred compensation accruals.

Northern Trust	 Eileen Rooney
Earnings Preview 2 - Buy / 48.76 (USD)
q Due to weak market conditions, we have reduced our 3Q01 EPS estimate to
$0.57, which is $0.01
below consensus expectations. We are reducing our 2001 estimate $0.03 to
$2.27 and reducing our
2002 estimate $0.10 to $2.50, due to weak market conditions. We continue to
rate NTRS 2 - Buy.
We lowered our price target to $60.
q Market conditions should restrict revenue growth in 3Q. However, operating
results should be aided by flat
to negative expense growth and a lower share count.
q Spread income should be up due to modest balance sheet expansion, with a
net interest margin that
should be wider than the prior quarter.
q Assets under administration and assets under management should decline in
the quarter.

Sky Financial Group 		Kristin Nemec
Third Quarter Preview 3 - Market Perform / 20.00 (USD)
q We have a $0.37 Q3 EPS estimate for Sky Financial, which is expected to
report October 16th. Our
full year estimates are unchanged at $1.45 and $1.55 for 2001 and 2002,
respectively. We are
comfortable with the attainability of this conservative, 7% EPS progression
and would highlight our
2002 estimate is $0.04 below consensus.
q We expect balance sheet trends to be largely in line with Q2 with 7-8%
loan growth with equivalent
percentage growth in deposits.
q Expense control, a historical strength at SKYF, should remain tight
brought about by the sale of the out-of-market
brokerage operations and greater integration of the remaining non-bank
subsidiaries.
q Along with general industry trends, we would not be surprised by further
upticks in NPA's to above 50 bps
and NCO's of more than 40 bps.

SunTrust Banks 	Eileen Rooney
Third Quarter Preview 2 - Buy / (USD)
q We continue to rate STI 2 - Buy, with a $70 price target. We expect the
company to report 3Q01
results of $1.21 in line with consensus.
q This should be the first quarter to include the acquisition of Robertson
Humphrey, which was acquired
during the middle of the quarter. Revenues and expenses are expected to be
about $30mm. Only the
optics of 3Q earnings should be affected. Like other investment banking
firms, RH's revenues should be
well below trend line this quarter.
q Third quarter results should also include approximately $30 mm in expenses
related to the attempted
merger with WB.

U.S. Bancorp		 Eileen Rooney
Earnings Preview 3 - Market Perform / 21.00 (USD)
q As a result of the continued economic deterioration, we are lowering our
2001 and 2002 estimates.
Our 3Q01 estimate remains $0.44, but that implies a modest contribution from
the NOVA
acquisition. For 2001, we are lowering our estimate $0.03 to $1.72
anticipating a down 4Q. For
2002, our estimate is $2.00 on a new GAAP basis, or $1.90 on an old GAAP
basis, a $0.10 reduction
of our estimate. USB remains rated 3 - Market Perform.
q 3Q results will include two months of operating performance from the
recent NOVA acquisition. In our
model, we increased credit card fees by $83mm, employee expenses by $53mm,
amortization expense by
$13mm and share count by 23mm share. 4Q results will include a full quarter
of NOVA results.
q The difficult market conditions should cause fee revenues from investment
management, investment
products and investment banking to be lower in 3Q and into 2002.
q Spread income should be up due to modest balance sheet expansion and a
modest expansion in the net
interest margin.

WestAmerica Bancorp	 Kristin Nemec
oied 3 - Market Perform / 40.00 (USD)
q Although not necessarily evident this quarter as it is a new initiative,
we believe WABC has
effectively turned over a new leaf by beginning to push for higher loan
growth through more
competitive pricing than it has in the past. This is important because
WABC's past strategy of
attaining roughly 10% EPS growth was heavily dependent on heavy share
repurchase and expense
savings as opposed to top line growth.
q We carry a $0.60 EPS estimate for WABC in Q3. WABC is expected to report
on October 16. This is two
cents above Q2 and a penny ahead of consensus.
q We believe the quarter will demonstrate additional NIM expansion, which
should be the largest driver of
spread income with funding costs continuing to drop faster than asset
yields.
q Non-interest revenue and expense dynamics should be in line with prior
quarters.


Wells Fargo		 Eileen Rooney
Earnings Preview 1 - Strong Buy / 43.17 (USD)
q Due to the deteriorating economic environment and difficult market
conditions, we have reduced
our 3Q01 EPS estimate to $0.68 and we are reducing our 2001 and 2002
estimates. These
reductions assume the impact of this environment on most bank results will
be slower loan growth,
weaker to declining investment management results into early 2002, higher
credit costs and even
weaker private equity results. The net interest margin should be modestly
stronger for most. We
continue to rate WFC 1 - Strong Buy.
q We are reducing our 2001 estimate $0.05 to $2.05 and reducing our 2002
estimate $0.15 to $3.35. For
WFC, the 2002 estimate is on a new GAAP basis and would be about $0.30
higher than an old GAAP
estimate.
q We lowered our price target $5 to $60 reflecting the more difficult
environment and our assumption of a
higher embedded equity risk premium.


Allmerica Financial 		J. Paul Newsome
EPS Estimates Reduced; Rating Affirmed 1 - Strong Buy / 42.30 (USD)
q ? We are maintaining our 1-Strong Buy rating on Allmerica following its
announcement of sharply
lower than expected third quarter earnings ($0.40 to $0.50) and our
subsequent conversations with
management. While our recent upgrade of Allmerica could not have come at a
worse time, the
thesis behind that upgrade is unchanged.
q In this environment most insurers are talking about how much their book
value will fall, but not Allmerica.
Its limited exposure to the World Trade Center disaster ($17 million
pre-tax), sustained (although greatly
reduced) profitability, and its limited general account common stock
exposure mean that it will see book
value maintained. We are projecting third quarter book value to be $47.60
per share.


Viacom Inc Stuart Linde
Quantifying the Risk 1 - Strong Buy / 32.05 (USD)
q Despite the fact that we are revising our estimates to reflect
macroeconomic factors, we believe
that VIAB's prominent brands, proven management team and strong balance
sheet position the
company to weather the storm. We believe VIAB will be one of the first
stocks to react to a media
resurgence.
q We are reducing our 2001 revenues to $23.0B from $23.6B on lowered ad revs
as large accounts pause to
reformulate campaigns, although solid ratings from the fall lineup could
help counter near-term weakness.

Eastman Kodak		 Caroline Sabbagha
Agfa Restructuring and Industry Comments 3 - Market Perform / 32.07 (USD)
q Yesterday Agfa announced a major restructuring plan and discussed industry
dynamics that
confirm some of our concerns about long-term industry fundamentals. Although
one could argue
that there are differences between Agfa's and Kodak's market positioning as
well as their
profitability profiles, we do fear that some of what Agfa discussed is
relevant for Kodak. We
maintain our 3-Market Perform rating on Kodak
q The industry dynamics include a tough pricing environment in film, the
need for further industry
consolidation and a digital transition that is occurring faster than
expected.

Microsoft Corp		 Michael Stanek
Expedia Deal May Have Erngs Impact to De 1 - Strong Buy / 50.27 (USD)
q Our Dec qtr estimate includes an $800M gain on the sale of Expedia (EXPE)
- MSFT's travel website
- to USA Networks (USAI), worth roughly $0.09 to EPS.
q Since the deal was announced in July 2001, Expedia shares have fallen
about 50% to $21.75, USAI
shares have fallen 30-35% to $17.88.
q Terms of the deal, set to close in Dec qtr: MSFT would sell 75% of its
stake in EXPE to USAI, mostly
completed in shares of common stock. There was a collar on the deal for
shares between $23-$31.

FSI International		 Edward White
Positive Develop. Outlined @Analyst Mtg. 3 - Market Perform / 8.00 (USD)
q FSII is doing all the right things during this downturn to preserve cash
and maintain suitable
infrastructure for rapid growth in the next upturn.
q On Wednesday, FSI held its annual analyst meeting at its headquarters in
Chaska, Minnesota. The
company highlighted that its focus during the current downturn is on (i)
preserving cash, (ii) developing
new technologies, (iii) forming key alliances, (iv) aligning management and
other employee interests with
those of shareholders, and (v) maintaining sufficient infrastructure for
rapid growth once the upturn
appears.

Enterasys Networks 		Timothy Luke
Ests & Rating Lowered 2 - Buy / 6.38 (USD)
q ETS reported an in-line 2Q02, but cautioned limited n-term visibility. To
reflect weakening in macro
conditions, we are lowering our ests & target. Maintain 2-Buy.
q Last night, ETS reported an inline qtr, with $240m in revs and $0.11 in
EPS vs our ests of $239m & 0.10.
Book to bill > 1. Channel inventory flat QoQ. Change fiscal year to Dec and
rev recog method.
q Mgmt commented business has ""grounded to a halt"" in Sept post 911 tragedy
and n-term visibility

q Against this challenging backdrop, we move our rev & EPS ests for 3Q02 to
$202m & $0.05 from $251m &
0.10. Our CY01 & CY02 revs move from $956m & $1.1b to $895m & $944m. Target

Yes, Elvis is still alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1 year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on Sunday morning. 
You guys are pathetic - No worse, you guys are geese.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

"[smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush","Dear Bros,
    I hate forwards on emails as much as the next guy, and perhaps it's the
last several beers I've just shared with brothers Grumbles, Elvis and the
Mule that causes me to forward this one.  Then again, maybe it's because I
couldn't have written it better myself.  For what it's worth.

A friend of mine sent this to me.  It is well worth your time to read... and
pray.
 >
 >
 > President  Bush
 >
 > This was the same man who came within a hair's breadth of losing an
 > election
 > in November, who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida
 > Democratic
 > machine to fix the vote count.
 > This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in
 > younger years, and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre
 > grades in college and an ill-fated oil venture.
 > This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father,  and
 > whose speaking missteps became known as ""Bushisms.""
 > And on Friday, this was the man who bore the weight of the world and
 > the responsibilities of a generation with dignity, class, confidence,
 > appropriate solemnity, and even much-needed wit.
 >
 > One thing struck me during the campaign, that difficult, roller-coaster
 > campaign that now seems years ago. It was that George W. Bush never
 > seemed to get ruffled. Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or
 > the sudden (some would say, vicious) release of a DUI arrest two
 > decades  ago at a key moment, ""W"" did not lose his cool. At times, his
staff
 > seemed overconfident, as did many of us. A 350-electoral-vote win,
 > they  quietly implied  . . . and we optimistically believed.
 >
 > Then they counted the votes, miscounted others, and re-counted still
others.
 > At the end, he was still there. Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed
 > and puffed,
 > trying to gin up something out of nothing, Bush quietly but confidently
 > waited at his ranch.  He didn't do nothing: that is the mistake people
have
 > constantly made with this man, confusing lack of  bluster for absence of
 > action.
 > No, his team of attorneys and the iron-willed James Baker were carrying
 > out his orders, but W stayed in the background, confident and faithful.
 >
 > You see, it is this faith business that confounded everyone. We have had
 > such actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically
 > whenever anyone used the term faith.  But this was the same man who
 > was the first politician ever in recent memory to name Jesus Christ as
 > the Lord of his life on public TV. Not an oblique reference to being
 > ""born-again"" or having a ""life change."" He said the un-PC-like phrase,
 > ""Jesus Christ,"" to which his handlers and advisors, no doubt, off  stage,
 > were also saying, ""Jesus Christ"" in a much different tone.
 >
 > God has a way of honoring those who honor Him. David learned that while
 > he was on the run from Saul's armies. Job learned that after his time of
 > horrible tribulation. The Messiah said so Himself,  many times.
 > So this was the man who actually put faith into practice. He actually
 > loves those who hate him. It is a staggering concept, so foreign in
 > daily occurrence that few thought it anything but grandstanding. Even one
 > of W's biggest supporters chided the President for adhering to his
 > ""new tone."" Yet there he was, again and again, thanking the Democrats.
 > Appointing his enemies to high places in his government. Inviting his
 > former foes and their wives to private movie screenings, and (I know,
 > this is hard to stomach) even treating them with dignity.
 >
 > See, this was the man who learned early on how  faith worked: by praying
 > for his enemies, you ""heap burning coals upon their heads.""
 > This was the man who named the absolute top people in national
 > security and defense, then caught barbs from the politically righteous
that
 > this one didn't have the right views on abortion or that one didn't have
 > the right position on guns.
 >
 > And on September 11, at mid-morning, this was the man thrust into a
 > position only known by Roosevelt, Churchill, Lincoln, and Washington.
 > The weight of the world was on his shoulders, and the responsibility of
 > a generation was on his soul.  So this same man---the one that the
 > media repeatedly attempted to tarnish with charges of ""illegitimacy,"" and
 > the one whose political opponents desperately sought to stonewall until
 > mid-term elections---walked to his seat at the front of the National
 > Cathedral
 > just three days after the two most impressive symbols of American
capitalism
 > and prosperity virtually evaporated, along with, perhaps, thousands of
 > Americans. As he sat down next to his wife, immediately I knew that even
if
 > his
 > faith ever faltered, hers didn't. I have never seen a more peaceful face
 > than Laura Bush, whose eyes seemed as though they were already gazing
 > at the final outcome . . . not just of this conflict, but of her reward
in
 > Heaven itself. In this marriage, you indeed got two for the price of one.
 >
 > Then came the defining moment of our generation. Some people fondly
 > recall their Woodstock days. Others mark with grim sadness November 22,
 > 1963, as the day America lost her innocence. But I firmly believe when
 > the history of this time is written, it will be acknowledged by friend
 > and foe alike that President George W. Bush came of age in that
 > cathedral and lifted a nation off its knees.  It wasn't so much his
 > words, though read a decade later, they will indeed be as stirring as
 > any. This conflict would end, he noted, "". . . at a time of our
 > choosing.""  It certainly wasn't his emotion. What had to have been one
 > of the most stunning exhibitions of self-control in presidential history,
 > W was able to deliver his remarks without losing either his resolve or
his
 > focus, or, more important, his confidence. It was as if God's hand, which
 > had guided him through that sliver-thin election, now rested fully on
him.
 > His quiet confidence let our enemies know . . . and believe me, they
 > know. . . that they made a grave miscalculation.

 > Now, this same man who practiced his faith through a tough election,

his

 > (well, ok, maybe the ""Clymer"" comment is an exception), this same man now

 >
 > As he walked back to his seat, the camera angle was appropriate. He was

 > I am with you always. And you can do this well, because I am going before
 > you. And don't worry about the weight. I've got it."" And I saw in his
 > eyes a quiet acknowledgement. ""I know. Thank you,  Lord.""
 >
 > Back at his seat, when W sat down,  George H. W. Bush reached over
 > and took his son's hand. The elder Bush always struck me as a religious

 > constant.
 >
 > Anyway, I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H. W. said, ""I

your

 > W squeezed back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept

"Farewell","Dear Jeff:

I read in the newspaper that you have decided to leave Enron. I'm sure you
are receiving thousands of letters like mine from many admirers everywhere.
As I said to you on other occasions, I truly enjoyed serving on your
committee to select the new fire chief. Your talents and natural gifts are
so great that not having you at Enron will clearly be a huge loss for that
company and the rest of us in the Houston community.  Best of luck and
Godspeed in your next endeavor.   As I said to you the last time we spoke, I
still would like to find some way to be on your team in the future.

"The McKinsey Mind","Hi Jeff,

Your assistant suggested that I send an email to discuss what I hope you
will find an intriguing proposition.

I am the co-author of a book entitled The McKinsey Mind - Understanding and
Implementing the Problem-Solving Tools and Management Techniques of the
World's Top Strategic Consulting Firm which is in final stages of editing
and will be published on September 21.  The other author is Ethan Rasiel,
who also penned The McKinsey Way in 1999 and the publisher is McGraw-Hill.
We are searching for high level successful executives who may be willing to
skim the manuscript (or read it thoroughly if you see fit) and offer a few
words of support for the cover of the book (which you can send via email).

You are our top choice as you are a McKinsey alumnus who had done an
incredible job after his career at the Firm.  We would be honored if you
would consider this request of your fellow alumni.  We don't believe it
would take much effort or time on your part, but it would really add in our
effort to get the word out.  By the way, the book represents a very positive
view of McKinsey and does not violate any confidentiality agreements.

Given the short time period involved (the published has requested all
endorsements by Friday), we will arrange for a copy of the manuscript to be
sent to you via overnight mail to arrive tomorrow. We recognize that you are
quite busy and would understand if you are unable to work with us.  If you
chose not to review this material, could you please just have the copy
properly shredded?  Thank you very much for your consideration and potential
help with this exciting project.  Ethan and I are big fans of what you have
done at Enron!

"The National Grid","Hi Jeff.  I hope you are enjoying the challenge of running Enron in the
midst of all the excitement and change in the energy industry.

I want to bring to your attention an issue that affects me quite directly in
my new role as CEO of TransElect, an independent electric transmission
company.  I think it also affects Enron in a very significant way.  The
National Grid has applied to the FERC for a declaratory order that would
permit the Grid to operate the Alliance RTO (this is a Midwest RTO that
includes AEP, Exelon, DTE, CMS, First Energy and Dominion).

I believe quite strongly that FERC should deny this petition because the
Grid is a significant owner of both distribution and generation assets in
the Northeast (New England Electric and Niagara Mohawk).  It is a very small
step from this decision to one that would allow Southern to operate
GridSouth, or one that would allow Entergy to operate the Florida RTO in
exchange for FP&L operating the Entergy RTO.  As a matter of National
policy, transmission operators should be independent of either the wholesale
or retail electric markets.  As a business issue, many transmission owners
are reluctant to divest of transmission because they retain hope that their
transmission can be used to protect above market native generation.  How
would you like to try shipping power into the Northeast with the Grid, a
major retail supplier and a significant generator, controlling access to the
market?

I think it is important that the FERC give the Grid a ""no"" on the request
for permission.  It is even more important that the issue be decided by the
""new FERC"".  There is a disturbing indication that the outgoing chairman
might okay this request on his way out the door.  I urge you to intervene as
a way to both slow down the freight train and as a way to get the right
answer out of FERC.  If you or your General Counsel would like more
information, give me a call at 503 636-7134, or call my General Counsel, Al
Statman, at 202 393-1200.

Thanks for considering the issue, and best wishes for continued success.

Fred Buckman

"Organising a meeting with you","Dear Jeff,

As you may remember, we last met at the Directors' conference in Barcelona,
last October.

On that occasion, I asked you whether you would be agreeable to the idea of
meeting some of the top executives of a client that I am serving in France,
EDF and even giving them a speech at their marketing conference. Given the
short notice, this turned out to be impossible at that point in time since,
at that time, you were ""booked"" for the following three months, if I
remember well!

You also told me that, provided you received some ""advanced notice"", it
would not be too difficult to organise the encounter at a different date
that the one I had then mentioned.

I am thus sending you this message to find out what is the earliest date we
could meet with you, preferably in Texas, since our client executives would
like to take advantage of the encounter to meet not only you, but also some
members of your management team.

Once I have a reply from you, I shall inform our client of the dates you
suggest and get back to you to finalise detail of when we could travel to
Texas and who we would like to meet, ideally .

I hope all is well with you and I look forward to reading your response to
this message.

Many thanks in advance, and best of all.

"Texas Children's Hospital Extends Additional Support to Medical C	enter Neighbors","Jeff,

I am pleased to update you on Texas Children's Hospital's current status in
the aftermath of Tropical Storm Allison.  Should you have any questions,
please do not hesitate to call me.

Texas Children's Hospital has taken several steps to support three Texas
Medical Center hospitals seriously damaged by the floods caused by Tropical
Storm Allison.

Support to The Methodist Hospital

Beginning today and continuing for the foreseeable future, Texas Children's
will make two operating rooms available to surgeons from The Methodist
Hospital for adult cardiovascular and liver transplant procedures.  In
addition, Texas Children's will dedicate a 12-bed unit to the adult
Methodist patients for their follow-up intensive care and post-operative
recovery.

The adult Methodist Hospital surgical procedures to be performed at Texas
Children's will be scheduled between 3:00pm and 3:00am to avoid conflicts
with the normal Texas Children's pediatric surgical schedules.

The Methodist surgeons will receive support in the Texas Children's
operating rooms from Methodist anesthesiolgists, radiologists, nurses, blood
bank and other Methodist allied health professionals.  Texas Children's
Hospital will provide additional support services to the Methodist adult
patients, including diagnostic imaging, laboratory tests, food and pharmacy
services.

Texas Children's will also provide a senior clinical administrator 24 hours
a day, seven days a week to facilitate communications in meeting the needs
of the Methodist physicians and nurses and their adult patients

The number of adult surgeries that will be performed by the Methodist
surgeons at Texas Children's Hospital will be governed by the capacity of
the 12-bed Texas Children's intensive care unit being made available.  This
arrangement will continue until The Methodist Hospital is able to return its
operating rooms and associated support facilities to service.

As it has done since the flood, Texas Children's will continue to accept
adult bone marrow transplant patients from The Methodist Hospital based on
Texas Children's room and staff availabilty.

Support to St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital

Texas Children's Hospital is in the process of working out details of an
agreement by which Texas Children's will make up to 30 beds available to St.
Luke's Episcopal Hospital for general acute care of adult patients.

The adult St. Luke's patients who will occupy these Texas Children's beds
will be under the care of St. Luke's physicians, nurses, allied health and
support services.  Texas Children's will provide experienced clinical
administrators to St. Luke's 24 hours a day, seven days a week to assure
seamless delivery of services to their adult patients.

This arrangement between Texas Children's and St. Luke's is anticipated to
be operational sometime next week.

Support to Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital

Texas Children's Hospital today hosted a meeting with executives from
Memorial Hermann Children's Hospital in which Texas Children's offered
Memorial Hermann up to 26 neonatal level 2 and general acute care beds.
Should Memorial Hermann accept this offer, it would staff these beds with
its own physicians and nurses, while Texas Children's would provide complete
support services.  No decision has been made regarding this proposal.

Texas Children's Hospital Flood Recovery Status

Although Texas Children's Hospital sustained an estimated $20 million in
damages and lost entirely one of its patient care buildings, we were able to
continue full operations with a 100+ percent patient census during the
floods caused by Tropical Storm Allison.

Since then, our inpatient census has remained near 100 percent while our
operating rooms, outpatient specialty clinics and emergency center have
functioned at their normal, high rates of performance.

Meanwhile, work continues to repair our damaged areas on the B2 basement
level and to complete loss assessments to be able to file claims with our
insurance carriers.  The Hospital carries a complete program of property,
equipment and business interruption insurance and expects to be adquately
reimbursed for its losses.

Our Sincere Gratitude to The Texas Children's Family

On behalf of the Texas Children's Hospital Board of Trustees, may I once
again express our deepest gratitude to everyone in the Texas Children's
Hospital Integrated Delivery System for your extraordinarily professional
response to the threats posed by the floods of Tropical Storm Allison and
their aftermath.

Most importantly, our mission of providing the finest possible pediatric
care to our young patients and their families continued uninterrupted during
and after the floods.  In addition, through your dedication and sacrifice,
we have been able to reach out to our neighbors in the Texas Medical Center
to help them care for their patients as they struggle to recover from the
terrible devastation they endured from the flood.

We are so very proud and honored to have you as members of the Texas
Children's family.

Again, thank you very much!

"strategy+business enews Exclusive: Governments Go Digital","Welcome to s+b's enews, an exclusive added-value from strategy+business.

This week: Governments Go Digital: Citizens Get a Direct Connection

New York, April 18, 2001 - Think of public agencies, and stereotypical images include long lines at offices and inattentive bureaucrats. Think again: Governments are using digital technologies to reinvent how they operate, complete with New Economy acronyms like G2G, G2C, and G2B.

Already e-Government initiatives are shaking up public agencies globally, dramatically changing the quality of services in both developed and developing countries. In the U.K., for instance, a single portal connects citizens with services dealing with life transitions, such as having a baby, finding a job, and retiring. In Egypt, the government is teaming up with multinationals to create home-grown high-tech industries and e-skilled college graduates. ""Governments need to be built on the principles of quickness, lightness, exactitude, multiplicity, and transparency - the opposite qualities to those we traditionally associate with governments, which have tended to be slow, heavy, vague about their goals, and secretive,"" said Geoffrey Mulgan, director of the U.K. Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit. ""E-Government plays into the new model.""

Brothers,
    Linda Grumbles just informed me that John is not recovering the way the
Drs. want him to and that the same artery may be blocked again, or even
closed.  In other words, the first catheter treatment didn't pan out.  He
goes back in for another one, this time probably installing a stint in the
artery to keep it open, next week on Sept. 14.  His email address has
changed and it's now jgrumbles76@hotmail.com.  I'm certain he and Linda
would appreciate your keeping them in your prayers.

Yours in -kai-,

		New Power Plants to be a key focus of Power Markets  2002  Richard Cheney has said we need a new power plant every week in order  to meet growing demand.  In fact, the industry is doing that and  more!    But powerplant construction is never simple, and always affected with  public policy.    This year's edition of Power Markets 2002 in Washington, D.C.  will provide the information you need to benefit from opportunities  created by the boom in powerplant construction:    * Lynn Church, President of the Electric Power Supply  Association, will introduce the topic with a discussion of today's  unique opportunities for merchant power.    * Joe Colvin, President and CEO of the Nuclear Energy Institute  will discuss the continuing, and growing role of nuclear  power.   The nuclear fleet has never delivered more energy  to the national grid, and the future hasn't looked this good for nuclear  construction in decades.    * John O'Brien, Skipping Stone, will discuss recent  experiences in the construction of coal-fired plants.   Coal  is still by far the dominant fuel for power generation in the U.S., and  shows no signs of giving up that status.    * PG&E National Energy Group will provide a presentation on  gas-fired generation.   By far the dominant category of  powerplant currently under construction, gas-fired plants are fast  becoming the incremental resource.     * Buck Buckner, Director of Marketing, Stewart &  Stevenson, will address distributed generation opportunities  spawned by shortfalls in transmission and distribution investment.    But the Conference is not just about powerplants.  It will also  cover: * retail markets * telecom and energy convergence * transmission  policy * credit risk * commodity exchanges * career trends and more!    And don't miss our pre-conference seminar: FUNDAMENTALS OF POWER  MARKETING on October 15, 2001.    Warmest Regards,  Glenn Lovin  Executive Director    P.S.  There are a few slots available for exhibitors.  See  brochure for details.    Click  Here to Download  Brochure

Jeff,
Just wanted to mention a couple additional things regarding building a ship here in Turkey. 
If Sherri can forward (perhaps by fax) a copy of the brochure you receive about the ""Expedition"" vessel, that would be very helpful. Based on what I have heard to date, there is a good shipyard just outside Istanbul -- in a place called Tuzlu -- that builds steel-hulled ships (as opposed to the frou-frou ""white"" hulled ones). It would be very useful if I dropped by there before I come to Houston, and the brochure would help me visualize better what you have in mind so I can focus my wanderings a bit.
On a related subject, is the ""big file"" that Bill dropped off too big to copy and send over, or should I just wait until I get to Houston next month?
Good to talk to you yesterday. Looking forward to getting together in Houston soon. 
Say hey to the kids and Rebecca.
Lots of love from all of us here,
Mark

"Question for floor meeting","Jeff:  I've been trying to get large enterprises to use us for getting incremental bandwidth.  The current mindset seems to be either ""I already have too much bandwidth"" or that ""I need my network to be secure; how can I trust you to be in business five years from now?"".  Can you suggest some ways of breaking this gridlock?  I firmly believe that getting some Fortune 50's on our roster will establish our reputation.

BTW, congratulations on making it on yet another list (this time a personal honor in Worth magazine).

"ENA Gas Structuring","
In addition to my current role of leading ENA's Wholesale Gas Structuring, I have been asked to take on ENA's Retail Gas Structuring for EES.  

I have asked Mark Breese to take the lead on all EES related activity effective immediately.  Mark will maintain a lead role on a couple of important wholesale transactions that are ongoing, but he will not be taking on any new wholesale deals.  Eric Moon will retain his lead role on all West Region deals and will take the lead on all new East Region deals.  Eric Boyt will retain his lead role for all Upstream and ECR deals, and will back up Eric Moon on new East Region deals as needed.  Santiago Garcia (Associate) has chosen to stay in Gas Structuring for his third rotation to contribute his needed experience to the team.  Finally, several Associates and Analysts are being added to Gas Structuring to handle increased Wholesale deal flow and the EES effort.

Mark Breese, Melissa Solis and I have moved to the 14th floor and we will office at the following locations:

	Mark Breese	EB-1457a
	Ed McMichael	EB-1456c
	Melissa Solis	EB-1456d

We are moving to the 14th floor to initially be closer to the EES business as well as free up space on the 32nd floor.  This move is temporary as all Gas Structuring (wholesale and retail) will be located together on the 6th floor in the new building.

"End of an Era","Hi Ken and Jeff,  

This email is being sent to let you know that my consulting contract with Enron has finally come to an end.  It has been a great experience to me to have been involved in the development of such successful international projects as, Puerto Quetzal in Guatemala in 1993, Batangas and Subic Bay in 1992/93 in the Philippines and Guam in 1996, all of which are still contributing to Enron's earnings.  The opportunities provided me during the first 26 years with Northern Natural Gas/Internorth, from which I retired in 1988, and the last 11 years as a consultant for Enron Development and Enron International have made me a better person and I thank you both for this.

I will continue to  be involved in consulting and development of both power and natural gas projects, although on a more limited basis, and only as an independent.

Should there be any need for my services or need to be contacted for any reason, I can be reached at:

Curly Baca & Associates, Inc.
5213 Sagecircle St. North
Houston, TX 77056-7075
713-629-7729
cell 713-515-8348
email: fbaca@pdq.net

Good luck as you both lead Enron, the Greatest Company, into the future,  and once again, Thanks for the opportunity!!

With Best Regards,



Curly Baca

If what I hear is true about your retirement, let me
be one of the first to offer heartfelt
congratulations. I've never quite understood people
that basically work right up to the grave. It always
seemed to me (and now I'm finding out its true) that
there are just way too many things to do, books to
read, people to meet, places to go, etc., etc., to
work 80 hour weeks for 50 years.

When I first read about it, I thought that maybe you
and Rebecca had flipped a coin and she lost. (She had
told me that if the two of you got engaged, one of you
would have to quit.)

If you really are planning to retire, let me offer
some advice. On my odyssey I've noticed a couple of
humps I had to get over. The first one hit me at about
ten days. All of a sudden I had the stupid impression
that I should find something constructive to do. After
a couple of days, the feeling went away. However it
did come back at about the 4 week mark. Once again, I
was able to come to my senses. I think I may have
permanently suppressed the feeling at this point.

Unfortunately, now that I really do have to go back to
work, I can't seem to get too motivated. Oh well,
maybe, if nothing else, I have learned not to work 80
hour weeks ever again.

Best of luck and tell my sister hi.


Steve


P.S. I have sketched you a raised timber platform,
with a small cabin in the center (for those that think
they need indoor plumbing, etc.) If you find a place
to put it, I want to build it.

P.P.S. I just finished the first two volumes of Caro's
L.B.J. biography. Extremely interesting if you're
looking for reading mat'l.

"Fast Company Interview Today","Jeff -- 

You are scheduled to do a 30-minute telephone interview today at 2:30 p.m. with Fast Company magazine for an article about teaching.  The underlying premise for the article is that to be an effective leader, you must be an effective teacher within your organization.  The reporter, Chuck Salter, was referred to you by David Garvin at Harvard and by a Portland Oregonian reporter.  Given that you transformed how Enron does business by teaching the organization a new business model, this is an ideal opportunity for you and to highlight our non-traditional culture.  For the article, Chuck is also interviewing top executives at Pepsi, Yellow Warp, National Geographic and the Philadelphia Inquirer.

The interview questions are likely to include the following:

Tell me about the teaching you do at Enron, either formally or informally. What do you teach? Whom do you teach? 
Why is it important to you?
What are the principles that guide your teaching?
What do leaders need to know, think about, and do to be better teachers?
How do you measure or evaluate teaching within a corporation? 
Tell me about someone who has benefited from your teaching. 
Tell me about your favorite teachers and what you learned about teaching from them. 

I will come to your office at 2:30 to place the call.

Thank you.
Karen

Dear Jeff,
 
Thank you for setting aside time to meet with me.  I have attached my resume to help bring you up to date on my career.  
 
As you will see, I have been providing advisory services since 1995.   During these years, I have done some of my best work.  I am proud of the service that I have rendered as an independent consultant.  
 
Now, I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career.  I look forward to sitting down with you to think through ways to apply my experience, intellect and energies to new professional challenges.  I respect you tremendously, and wherever the next part of my career may lie, I know that my search and choice will benefit significantly from your perspective.
 
Finally, I am attaching the recommendation to HBS that you wrote in 1981.  I found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life.  Your historic words of support helped me keep fighting and successfully moving forward.
 
If you would like to reach me before our meeting, please call (213) 926-2626 or email kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net .  Thank you again.
 
Sincerely,

"My Concerns","



Good morning Mr. Skilling.


When I arrive at work today the only e-mail I had was the EES Distribution, and my first though  
was great my day is going to go well. When I open and realised it was an opportunity to ask you a 
question, I though long and hard about it. The reasons being is that most of the little people in a company 
of this size never really get their voices heard on any issue,  and being a contractor make it even harder 
so why would this be any different. Another concern was,  will a person like yourself really have time in your 
busy schedule to read and answer every e-mail, phone call all or written correspondence he receives from an employee.
 But Mr Skilling I am taking the chance that you yourself  can hear this voice .

My question to you this morning is very important to me and I am quite sure to many others like myself.

I would like to know  why is it that Enron spend so much money, training and time on contractors like myself, only to turn around and hire someone
else to do the same job that the contractors are doing already. Wouldn't it be easier  and cheaper to offer the job to the contractor,
or just give them the opportunity to accept or decline the offer.?


Mr. Skilling I think that  Enron is a great company to work for because of all the information, that I have learned in my eight months of employment.
But like most company their is always room for improvements. Also Mr. Skilling this is not a pitch for employment, it just a question of concern.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you.

I wish that your day will be a great and less busy one. Have a great day.


Hope to hear from you soon.

Attached is the email from Jorge.  We are in the process of terminating Jorge due to performance and relation issues.  We are doing this immediately due to the nature of Jorge's job, although we were trying to delay until the replacement was in place.  Given recent actions (not the email below), we have decided to move forward with the termination this afternoon.

"Hi","Mr. Skilling,

I wanted to make you aware of the fact that I was leaving NewPower.
My last day at NewPower should be in the week to come.

Foremost, I wanted to thank you for the time you have given me while I was at Enron and NewPower.
This past year at NewPower has been a very intense and intellectually lucrative learning experience, which have brought me many skills.
My experience at both companies has been wonderful, fruitful and exciting.

I was glade to see that the NewPower/Enron Employee program faired well.

Best continuation, as President & CEO of Enron Corp and to your family.
Will look forward to the chance of meeting with you again.


Regards,
Wilson Kriegel



I have attach my resume, so you would see the opportunities and experience I have gained at Enron & NewPower.

"","Jeff/Mark or Sherri or whoever gets your emails:

Thanks for the Astros tickets.  The estate planning lawyer that I am using is Don Fizer with Fizer, Beck, something, something.  He is located in the Galleria at 1360 Post Oak Blvd, Suite 1600, Houston, TX  77056 and his number is 713-332-4251.  He has been great to work with because I was clueless and he was able to explain this stuff in a way that was pretty easy for me to understand.  I also recommend making the first stop at the law firm instead of the trust company or financial advisor because I have found several of the trust companies and financial advisors really trying to push cookie cutter stuff and it is pretty easy to get something that doesn't fit your specific needs.  I found Don very good at looking at my situation and directing me to a couple specific strategies and then to a couple trust companies that are better equipped to handle that.  

The trust company I went with was Sentinel Trust, they are located at San Felipe and Kirby - 2001 Kirby Dr, suite 1210, Houston, 77019-6081.  Bob Sweeney is my contact there 713-528-3728.  I went with them for two reasons.  1 Because I was basically philosophically aligned with their approach ... conservative ...and I liked them better.  
and 2 they are very rigorous in their evaluation of investments and they have a guy named Bruce (I don't have his last name) who is interesting to talk to about markets, investments etc and I think he is smarter than the average bear.  

I will get you the name of the other trust company when I can find it.

Good Luck


Ken

"Planning a meeting","Jeff,

Just got off the phone with Chuck. He gave me this corporate e-mail for you.
From the press releases I've read, it sounds as if you will be consulting
with Enron for some time to come.

As you might remember, I run a professional alliance within Smith Barney
that designs and coordinates financial strategies for people like yourself.
Our team appeals to clients who want an independent source of financial
advise, but need the vast resources of a Citigroup.

Our experience in working with highly successful executives and
entreprenuers, has been that periods of transition often provide a great
opportunity to assess one's position and direction. Your financial goals are
of course , an intregal part of any such review. We are uniqely qualified,
experienced and committed to serving the highly affluent private client.

I dropped the ball after our conversation last year but would love to have
the opportunity to hear your plans for the future and whether or not we
could be of service to you. Should I call Sherri Sera at he office to set an
appointment? Just let me know what you would recommend. Hope all is well.
Mark Paul

> An unemployed man goes to apply for a job with Microsoft as a janitor.
> The manager there arranges for him to take an aptitude test (Section:
> Floors, sweeping and cleaning).
> After the test, the manager says, ""You will be employed at minimum
> wage, $5.15 an hour. Let me have your e-mail address, so that I can
> send you a
> form to complete and tell you where to report for work on your first day.
> Taken aback, the man protests that he has neither a computer nor an

> Stunned, the man leaves. Not knowing where to turn and having only $10 in

> Within less than 2 hours, he sells all the tomatoes individually at 100%

> year, he is the owner of a fleet of pick-up trucks and manages a staff of
> a
> hundred former unemployed people, all selling tomatoes.
> Planning for the future of his wife and children, he decides to buy some

> the adviser asks him for his e-mail address in order to send the final

> When the man replies that he has no e-mail, the adviser is stunned,

> After a moment of thought, the tomato millionaire replied, ""Why, of

> I would be a floor cleaner at Microsoft!""
> Moral of this story:
> 1. The Internet, e-mail and e-commerce do not need to rule your life.
> 2. If you don't have e-mail, but work hard, you can still become a

> 3. Seeing that you got this story via e-mail, you're probably closer to

"The Morning Market Call - Friday May 11th, 2001."," <<MF May 11th, 2001.pdf>>

				Good Friday Morning - Comments From The
Local Guys!

Economic data so far this quarter has been extremely ambiguous. On the one
hand, the employment figures released last Friday were soft, with net hiring
shrinking for the second consecutive month and the unemployment rate rising
to 4.5%. On the other hand, consumer sentiment has improved, and the April
retail sales figures were stronger than anticipated. As we have mentioned,
this mixed data has increased the odds the Federal Reserve will ease by only
25bp next Tuesday. At this stage, Lehman Brothers' economists still think
the odds favor a 50bp cut, given the underlying weakness in the economy,
particularly in high-tech and manufacturing, together with the abysmal
employment data.

The change in the perception on the strength of the economy can be seen in
the higher interest rates posted below.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.87%.
The 10-year yield is 5.47%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.98%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.62 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $4.27 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Entertainment S. Linde, .212.526.4009
Upfront Preview: CBS and FOX Appear Well Positioned
*With the WGA negotiations all but settled, the Entertainment industry will
now turn its sights to the upfront selling cycle, which
commences May 14 with presentations from the major Networks lasting through
May 17.
*The current ad market has created fears of a weak upfront market. Ad buyers
must be careful not to look at the current economic
environment as a proxy for the future. Based on this premise, there may be
upside to our 5%-10% estimated decline in upfront sales
(based on 65%-70% inventory sales with low to mid single digit price
increases).
*In our opinion, VIAB and FOX are the best positioned for this year's
upfront given that improved ratings in the key 18-49
demographic combined with our expectation for modest CPM increases will
boost unit pricing.

Reebok Intl Ltd(RBK) 2 - Buy R. Drbul, .212.526.4714

FY: 12/31 Price Target $36 $36
Rank 2 2
*On May 21, Reebok will be hosting an investor day in Canton, Massachusetts.
We believe that this event should be highly
informative as investors will have the opportunity to view the crucial back
to school product line as well as hear several key
executive presentations.
*We expect to hear presentations from David Perdue, a Reebok veteran and
recently appointed president of the Reebok brand, Jay
Margolis, president of the specialty division (Rockport, Ralph Lauren
footwear and Greg Norman brands) and Terry Pillow,
President of the Rockport brand, among others.
*We will also be looking for additional information on the company's new NFL
licensing deal, which could generate $200 million and
be accretive by $0.05 in 2002 (included in our 2002 estimate).
*We believe that an inflection point in the stock could be the 3Q01, where
we are estimating $60 million of NFL revenues. This
incremental revenue should aid in 12% overall revenue growth for RBK.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $28 $28
Rank 2 2
*Our meeting with senior management yesterday confirmed that demand for
STOR's services remains strong; we believe that the stock
is still undervalued at current levels despite its recent rise.
*STOR's management stated that the pipeline of activity for new customers
continues to be robust and that its current customer base is
also growing.
*We believe that STOR is benefiting from the increasing complexity of
managing enterprise data storage environments.
*We believe STOR is funded to profitability.
*The company's maturing sales force should lead to continued productivity
gains. In addition, STOR is shifting its revenue mix to
higher margin services.
*We believe that the stock overhang stemming from the lock-up expiration is
largely behind us.
*Despite its recent run, the stock is still trading at a discount to its
peer group.

McDonald's Corp(MCD) 1 - Strong Buy M. Speiser, .212.526.3255
Reducing '01 EPS not on Ops/adj share base & int expense
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $27.2 EPS 2000 N/A $1.46 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $40 - 25 EPS 2001 $1.50E $1.46E $1.50E 18.6
Mkt Cap: $37.6B EPS 2002 $1.71E $1.66E $1.69E 16.4
FY: 12/31 Price Target $38 $38
Rank 1 1
*Our lower EPS view is not based on weakening Operations, but is due to
adjustments to our share base & interest expense estimates.
So we do not expect much impact on the stock. Lowering already-weak EPS
expectations will likely prove to be beneficial for the
stock. Maintain Op outlook
*Reducing our '01 EPS view from $1.50 to $1.46, now flat vs. a yr-ago & the
low on the Street
*Our revision reflects adjustments to our share base & interest expense
estimates. With $1.2b in buyback targeted in '01 & $452m
done in 1Q, our previous forecast reflected more aggressive repo; mgmt is
adamant that '01 buyback would not pass $1.2b. Also,
higher debt levels will not likely be offset by weak currencies as much as
we thought
*Imp'rtantly our Op outlook albeit weak is unchanged
*Maintain 1-rating. We're now confident that our '01 EPS view will not be
lowered anymore. With the shares at a 4+ year valuation
low & the bar on expectations very low, the risk/reward is favorable

IBM Corp(IBM) 1 - Strong Buy G. Elling, .212.526.3823
Innovate and Integrate: Gerstner Gives Vision for Future
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $116.98 EPS 2000 N/A $4.44 N/A N/A

FY: 12/31 Price Target $160 $160
Rank 1 1
*Yesterday IBM hosted its annual meeting for security analysts in New York.
While there were no major surprises, CEO Lou Gerstner
did outline some trends for the future, and stressed the importance of
innovation and integration (i.e., Technology and Services) for
the company going forward.
*Gerstner emphasized the importance of services as a driving force in all IT
spending, including hardware and software. Gerstner also
cited the need for continued technological development as a way to avoid
price wars driven by commoditization of products.
*Gerstner stressed IBM's commitment to high single-digit revenue growth and
double-digit earnings growth in the future. Gerstner
indicated that the company would not simply grow revenue at any cost, but
was instead focused on EPS and cash flow driven by an
operational execution.
*We maintain our current estimates and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating on
IBM shares.
IT Consulting & Computer Services K. Keirstead, .212.526.0442
Gerstner's View of IT Services
*Yesterdays comments from the CEO Lou Gerstner and the head of IBM Global
Services Doug Elix represent positive long-term
statements about the IT services industry. IBM is positioning itself as a
services-lead company and claimed that the services business
is now the most important segment of the technology sector. The meeting
supports our positive view of EDS while the comments
about the consulting and systems integration market make us incrementally
more worried about Sapient and Computer Sciences.

Electronic Arts(ERTS) 3 - Market Perform F. Kantor, .212.526.5562
Upside to Q; Outlook Bullish; Wish Stock Were Cheaper (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $54.52 EPS 2000 N/A $0.00 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $62 - 25 EPS 2001 $0.84E $0.89E $0.68E 61.3
Mkt Cap: $7.6B EPS 2002 N/A $1.71E $1.74E 31.9
FY: 3/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*There is no doubt in our minds that ERTS is one of the premier publishers
in the industry. The co's solid performance in a difficult Q
makes it easy to believe that when hurdles are absent (i.e. an abundance of
game consoles) they can outperform. That said, we wish
the stock were not so pricey. Due to valuation, we reiterate our market
perform.
*1Q01 operating EPS of $(0.09) vs $0.08 were better than our $(0.15) est.
Most of the upside came from EA Core, where in line revs
were bolstered by lower op. exp. At EA.com, slightly higher revs were offset
by lower margins.
*We are raising our consol. FY02E to $0.89 from $0.84 and are initiating
quarterly EPS of $(0.13), $(0.05), $0.87 and $0.20. We are
also initiating a consol. FY03E EPS of $1.71.
*Adjusting for EA.com, ERTS currently trades at a forward P/E of 35.3x -
higher than hist averages. Though ERTS is on the cusp of
solid growth, this valuation indicates that it is currently in the stock.

IDEC Pharmaceuticals(IDPH) 2 - Buy M. Wood, .212.526.4035
IDEC: Response on Zevalin to the FDA by mid-July. (A,C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E

FY: 12/31 Price Target $49 $49
Rank 2 2
*IDEC expects to answer the FDA's questions on Zevalin by mid-July. Our
assumption for launch in 1Q02 remains intact.
*The FDA has issued a Complete Review Letter on Zevalin, asking IDEC to
address a number of clinical and CMC issues.
*The FDA is not requiring additional Phase III trials or further imaging on
patients for the BLA submission.
*The timing for Zevalin at the FDA remains a question. There are currently
no completion requirements for the FDA, although we are
clearly encouraged by IDEC's ability to respond quickly.
*We continue to expect launch in 1Q02. We maintain our sales projections for
Zevalin in 2002 and 2003 at $70.9 million and $119.8
million, respectively.

"Closing Remarks","
My friends,

It is with some regret that I must tell you that I am leaving EBS & Enron as of Aug. 15th.  I have learned a lot during my long tenure at EBS.  Admittedly, some of what I've learned is how not to start a business; but I've also learned numerous positives around teamwork, management, setting goals, and defining new product markets.  All in all, I have definitely come out of the experience enriched.

What I regret the most is having to leave all of you.  I believe very strongly in the role of good people in achieving greatness.  And I have worked with some very brilliant, creative people while at EBS.  All of you have, in one way or another, enriched my life and work.  I really appreciate that.  

If I had a single wish before I left, I would like for Enron to better understand that to achieve greatness as a company, it is not sufficient to ""will"" it to occur.  At a minimum, it requires the right people, with the right skills, and the right knowledge, in the right area, and at the right time.  The key emphasis here is people.  People can't guarantee success; but they are a necessary prerequisite.

I will continue to be available till the 15th to transition any projects, knowledge, or whatever people need.  And after the 15th, I will be around from time-to-time on a consulting basis with various Enron groups.  My current plan is to stay in the Houston area for the foreseeable future, primarily consulting and working with various organizations to support entrepreneurship in the area. Please feel free to contact me at any time to talk on any topic.


I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes:

	""We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails""

Thank you.

	-larry

"Floor meeting question","Dear Jeff,

I have been an employee of EBS for just about one year.
I relocated from New York City, where I had lived and worked all of my life. The reason I made the move to Enron and Houston was the ""opportunity and growth"" that EBS was going to provide. I sold my home, left my job at AT&T of 18 years and uprooted my family and bought a home in Houston.
I enjoyed my various jobs at EBS very much and felt as though I have made a strong contribution to EBS.
Yet, I have been told that my position is no longer needed and have been placed in the redeployment program. I have had no opportunities presented to me within Enron or EBS during the past 30 days. I have 15 days to find a job.  My family is very upset and worried.

My question is "" What is the company doing about employees that have been released and feel betrayed?'

About HMTF: Founded in 1989, Hicks, Muse, Tate & Furst Incorporated (HMTF)

appreciation.

HMTF and its predecessor have successfully completed over $50 billion of
leveraged transactions. In addition to the firm's primary focus on
leveraged acquisitions, HMTF, through affiliated entities -- including
TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Partners, Olympus Real Estate Corporation, Stratford
Capital Partners and 21st Century Group -- is also actively engaged in the
management of other specialized asset categories, including high-yield and
mezzanine securities, real estate, Small Business Investment Company (SBIC)
debt and equity investments, and private equity investments in
minority-owned businesses.

About speaker:  Jack D. Furst has been a partner of HMTF since the year it
was founded. He has more than 18 years of experience in private equity
investments. At HMTF, he is involved in all aspects of the firm's business
and has been actively involved in originating, structuring and monitoring
investments. Prior to joining HMTF, Mr. Furst was a vice president and
subsequently a partner of Hicks & Haas Incorporated. Previously, he was a
merger and acquisition/corporate finance specialist for First Boston
Corporation in New York and a financial consultant at Price Waterhouse.

Mr. Furst received his BS degree in business from Arizona State University
and his MBA from the University of Texas. He was inducted into the Arizona
State University College of Business Hall of Fame in 1999.

He serves on the boards of several HMTF portfolio holdings.  Mr. Furst also
serves as an executive board member of Circle Ten Council (Boy Scouts) and
as a member of the CBA Foundation Advisory Council and MBA Investment Fund
at the University of Texas at Austin. He is a minority owner of the Dallas
Stars hockey team and the Texas Rangers baseball team through his interest
in Southwest Sports Group.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

old 3058 Yale.  As you can see, our chapter has decided to overlook Rocky's
many, many trips to the roof in the early 70's and bestow a Distinguished
Beta Award on his ass.  I would think that any compromising pictures one
might have of Brother Skilling would be extremely appropo for this occasion.
  I, for one, will be unable to attend due to the Redhead's and my 30th H.S.
reunion in Corpus on that day, but if you have anything young Adrew M Carty
could use, I'm certain he would appreciate.  He's also obviously the contact
arrange your presence there, should you be so inclined.

Yours in -kai-,

Drow

Subject: Beta at SMU
Date: Sat, 11 Aug 2001 17:47:26 -0700

Brother Berry,

Hopefully by now you've received my letter regarding the Distinguished Gamma
Omega Alumni Award.  If you haven't, the Gamma Omega Chapter is giving a
distinguished alumni award to Brother Jeff Skilling.  The event will take
place at the Melrose Hotel in Dallas on October 6th.
I got your email address from one of Mr. Skilling's secretaries.  I'd like
to make sure that every '75 Beta knows about this event and has the first
chance to attend, as the space we have is limited.
In addition, we are looking for any pictures of SMU life in 1975, with a
focus on Beta life and of course, Mr. Skilling.

If you can be of any help, that would be great.

You can reach me at this email address(acarty@mail.smu.edu), or at my home
telephone number: 214-369-6346.

Thanks,

___kai___

"Thank you!","Dear Jeff,

I was saddened to hear that you have decided to leave Enron.  I couldn't help but reflect back to this past April when I had the opportunity to travel with you for two consecutive days to Harvard and NYU and remember the pearls of wisdom that you imparted about business on our flight.  I will remember them always!  I would like to wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and thank you for a great two years that I have had with the A/A program here at Enron.  I will find it a great honor if you feel that I can be of any assistance in the future.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

"GREETINGS FROM JOSEPH","I visited with Joseph Kaye last evening.  He is now in a private room, and is healing as fast as he can.  He is able to sit up by himself, and can walk the hall with assistance.  His remarkable recovery is,  no doubt,  due to his equally remarkable attitude.  His left arm is in a cast, and he is in a lot of pain from the fractures to his face and the back of his skull.  It's difficult for him to eat because of the discomfort remaining from the intubation which had kept him alive immediately following the accident.  In spite of all the above, he looks toward his full recovery and wanted me to tell you that he knows he is alive because of your prayers.

He was proudly wearing an MS150 ""finish"" pin on his hospital gown which Pat Bertotti took to him, and was thrilled with the  ""finish"" cap from Team Enron.

When I asked what he'd like to tell the team, he asked me to send you his love and his appreciation for your prayers.  He also asked that you always remember how precious life is, how precious our basic life functions are that we sometimes take for granted.....He shared with me that his Pedal Partner, Tim Hart, had come to visit him at the hospital to thank him for the effort he made to ride and raise money for MS.  Joseph knows that the pain and struggle he has now will be gone in time, but that his Pedal Partner has year after year to deal with the circumstances of managing his life with MS.

Joseph purchased, just before the tour, a great pair of sunglasses with prescription lenses.  They were totaled in the crash, and I thought it would be a good idea for the team to replace those glasses for him.   If you'd like to donate to this, please send your checks to me.  It wouldn't take much from each rider, and what we have left, we can donate to MS in Joseph's honor, since I'm sure he'll not be in any shape to collect his pledges before deadline, and I know he is concerned about the pledges he had promised.   He is very devoted to this cause.  Make your checks payable to Enron Cycling Club and send to address below.  (Please make sure if you are also sending a get-well card to Joseph to put your check in a separate envelope, as I do not open the correspondence you send to him.)  All riders donating to the glasses will have their names included on the presentation.  We have sent him a floral arrangmeent from the team for delivery today.

He enjoyed the mail you have sent, and if you have any more cards and letters please send to:

Amelia Alder, Enron Corp., P.O. Box 1188, Suite 3AC3120, Houston, TX 77251-1188

If you'd like to email him, please send to me and I will print out and deliver.

"This FERC isn't like any FERC you've known","Here's the activist thinking
of the other half of the
Wood-Brownell team
___

This FERC isn't like any
FERC you've known or
worked with recently

If you don't like markets, here's the very bad news.
     ""This FERC is all about markets and everything we do is going to be guided
by that,"" Nora Mead Brownell reminded.
     She intends being a one term (five years) member who has her work cut out
for her -- building market infrastructure.
     ""Not retrenching and not recreating, we are going to be defining and
directing and collaborating to transform ourselves as we make the markets work -
- creating policies that make markets work.""
     Look for some ""very specific business planning and strategy so there will
be no doubt about what's coming.  It won't be the surprise of the hour or `I
don't know what that FERC is all about.`""
     What does she think of the MORC room -- the market observation resource
center at FERC where five people can watch transactions and prices
real time?
     ""It's a good first step but it needs further development,"" she replied.
     The agency needs people who've worked in markets and have real world experience
on energy trading floors, Brownell noted.
     Brownell is not much for rulemaking but early on ""you've got to set the
guideposts"" especially where the ""power of the incumbent is very, very strong.""
     ""If you don't have any rules in place you can't find anybody guilty,"" she
noted, ""cause there's no crime.""
     It's been noticed that the market-based rates were not conditioned on
certain behavior, such as:
     ""If you engage in the following behavior it's a no-no.""
     There may have been behavior in the market ""of which you and I would
disapprove but if it's not in the Ten Commandments, it's hard to take somebody
out to the woodshed.""
     Meanwhile, we expect the White House to give FERC a fifth member who will
provide a market-oriented vote.  Is there any doubt in Brownell's mind?
     ""Not in mine.  President Bush has been very, very clear about his
philosophy on markets for a long time,"" she said.
     Brownell is excited about the opportunity the new commission has ""to make a
difference.""
     ""We better make a difference.""
     For her, the issues are bigger than jurisdiction and even markets.  What's
at stake in her mind is creating an economic environment in which people invest
in infrastructure.  ""If we don't really begin to take advantage of that
opportunity there's going to be an enormous price to pay.  We saw it in the West
and we're about to see it in lots of other places.
     ""It's what drove me to feel so strongly about those RTOs.  I know that's
complicated and we have work to do but when I see unnecessary costs in the price
of electricity I know what happens to the end user, the small businessman the
big users and the retail customers on limited income.
     ""If we can solve the problem and we can focus on the problem the
jurisdiction answers will come or they'll be so clear that it will be
unavoidable.
     ""Rather than start with who's going to do what, we should start with what
do we need to do to build the backbone for this country to continue to grow,""
she explained.
     It's her goal to recast the debate on ""what this is all about.""  Her view
is that ""it's about economic development -- plain and simple.""
     How about making progress in bringing market forces to bear on transmission
costs?
     Maybe an auction of capacity as with gas capacity.
     Brownell wants to know more about the proposal before expressing a view.
     Without RTOs and transparency in the market, she's skeptical ""that that can
happen.""
     How can you bring market forces into transmission, we asked.
     She sees RTOs fostering market forces to bear because the market will have
confidence that there will be equity and opportunity.
     ""Until we resolve the issue of access and structural management, no capital
will flow.""  For her, the capital flow is the proof that a market is working.
     Those two issues, if unresolved, prevent innovation, she added.
     Brownell cited congestion pricing that rewards congestion, ""if you happen to
be the guy who owns the line that's creating it,"" Brownell explained, ""having
the opposite effect.""
     The massive structural changes that cause some consternation in the
community are what's necessary.
     She doesn't want to wake up two years from now and realize ""either we've
totally destroyed the markets and therefore totally put our country's
development back five years because we have no investment and no plants and no
real reliability oversight -- nor do I want to create a system in which we have
unregulated monopolies as in the telecom industry.
     ""You saw that wonderful burst of new technologies and the long distance
prices dropping that no one ever imagined.""
     Brownell expects that kind of technological explosion in energy but we
haven't seen it yet.
     When a market really drives the energy field, she predicted fuel cells that
work in a short period of time or we'll see 50 new things.
     Those who believe the old system works just fine win no brownie points with
Brownell.  ""It wasn't supporting growth.  It wasn't terribly efficient.
     ""I didn't notice a lot of innovation.  Frankly I don't miss my old, black
rotary phone.  I'm not going to miss my clunky, 40-year old plant.  I'd like to
have distributed generation right at my back door.
     ""And then it became more and more clear that the (telecom) market was not
working to everyone's advantage, was not equitable and you had this meltdown and
you now have unregulated monopolies.""
     In electricity that would be a tragedy and the cost would be even greater
than with regulated ones, she said.
     What kind of changes would Brownell like to see at FERC?
     New ways of problem solving.  ""Markets do not wait 15 months or 11 months
while you go through the ritualized process... Not just with FERC but anybody
that has to observe due process.""
     But when the Pennsylvania PUC implemented the retail power marketing,
stakeholder from the marketers, the incumbent, operations people, not lawyers,
ran into problems daily.
     The PUC created a team under Kevin Cadden who's joined FERC as external
affairs director.
     The Cadden team met three times a week in the first couple of weeks to deal
with problems of multiple scheduling coordinators and Cadden had the authority
to make decisions at the meetings.
     Where there was a huge policy impact he would go to commissioners for
notational voting.
     That meant that stakeholders couldn't go commissioner shopping -- ""a big
sport in Pennsylvania, people got real serious about it and they solved the
problems.""
     Brownell wants to see that methodology in Washington.  ""We need to find
ways to build up the trust here.
     ""The best thing in the world that could have happened in the California
situation or the western mitigation is for all those people to get in a room and
settle,""  Brownell advised.
     Her fear is that FERC will make a decision and it will be litigated for five years
leaving everyone -- the agency, the companies and the customers -- exposed
to the vicissitudes of the courts.
     We noted that it's been about five years in New Hampshire from enactment to
implementation.
     Brownell favors non-traditional ways of solving problems -- the use of
""swat teams of people starting with say 10 real smart state commissioners"" to
get in a room to come up with options to prevent congestion pricing for example
""and then we'll have an open hearing and talk about it.""
     Brownell is a big supporter of Chairman Pat Wood's operational switch away
from the method of recent FERC leaders whereby members' staffs carry around
notes and ideas from commissioner to commissioner until an accord is struck.
     Then the decision is presented as a done deal with written-in-advance
speeches read at voting.
     The commission in effect says ""here is the right answer,"" Brownell claims.
     Wood's plan is to have open debate.
     ""It's a great idea,"" Brownell said.  ""It encourages our staffs to think in
a safe environment instead of just being told what the answer is.""
     FERC members have talented staffers who need to be encouraged to come up
with ""and get out"" imaginative solutions, she observed.
     The open debate ""let's us signal to people how we're thinking and where
we're going.""
     ""We're talking at meetings because we want ideas.  We want to explore all
the options and not come in and say `here is the right answer.'
     ""There are probably 10 right answers,"" Brownell reminded.
     Many sacrifices so far:  On a personal note, leaving Pennsylvania when she
did, Brownell lost a newly enacted pension for state government employees.
     Had she hung on three more weeks she would have gotten a pension but the
urgency of big votes on California and the RTOs was such that she thought it
wrong to sit around in Harrisburg waiting for the money.
     ""The last thing I wanted was to have the lights go out in California and
have me sitting there (in Harrisburg),"" she observed.
     While the FERC pay of $125,700 is greater than the PUC's $105,086 the cost
of living in the Nation's Capitol is much, much higher.
     The PUC provides a car and doesn't charge commissioners monthly parking.
     Brownell bought a home on Capitol Hill and will be able to walk in good
weather but will still have to pay the monthly parking.

"There are never enough of good people ...","Dear Jeffrey:

I came across your name in the business press. As an industry leader you are
knowledgeable about the latest trends and where the companies are heading. You
constantly meet top managers and some may be hungry for management talent
and/or require rapid change action.

What value can I bring?

I have nine years of combined experience in management, change consulting,
international marketing and business development.  Most recently, I took part
in transforming Fortune 500 companies into more active e-business players.B
 efore, in four years I have developed international markets from 0 to over 40
country coverage, 140 companies and units (mostly in Europe, but also in the
Middle East and in Asia).

I am looking for right opportunities and growth challenges.

If the organization wants to speed up their international expansion and avoid
some costly mistakes, I can bring in a successful record of developing business
and resources in country-to-country approach, balancing
think-global-and-act-local theme.

And/or

If the organization can benefit from broad range of change experience: I led
project teams of art designers and copywriters achieving national promotion
goals, led researches towards addressing relevant issues in their projects, led
consultants in delivering management change programs for major corporations,
led the creating of new customer and supplier networks globally. These were
project teams representing diverse experience, background, and management
levels.

And/or, finally

If you would like to share your insider's perspective on where the industry is
heading in exchange I can provide my insights into developing business in
Europe.

I am flexible on location and only a phone call away.


Sincerely yours

"The Morning Market Call - Friday September 21st, 2001.","
			Good Friday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Over the years, we have tried to use this letter for purely business
purposes and not to push any personal agenda. However, now is the time to
make some personal comments.
Everyday, we find it difficult to comprehend what we saw on that fateful
Tuesday morning. The enormity of the what was done, with out regard to life.
Nothing! Who could plan such a thing. Who would! It is hard, very hard,  to
conceptualize what they did. What type of mind would think to do such a
thing. And then have others who would agree that it was a good idea! What
type of people. And the cheering!
We think of our fellow Americans (and others) who perished. And the hero who
gave their lives on the plane and on the ground. We think of the heroes who
did not give their lives.
We think of the friends that we never met! The friends that we now will
never meet. How could humanity do what was done. We think of our business
associate Ira Zaslow, who is missing. Our thoughts are with his family. We
think of all those who lost their lives. We think of their families. Lives
snuffed out by people consumed with hate. And not only lives lost last week.
We think of the missing generations to come. Those generations that will
never be! Oh, the waste - for what!
Rally around America. Rally around Democracy. Rally around what is right!
There is no equivocation about Right and Wrong! Life is sacred! Those who
disregard life, are the ones who will be condemned for eternal damnation!
There, it has been said.

The following comment was written yesterday, but was never sent.
The bottom line is go out, buy stocks and go out and buy in the shops and
malls. And light a candle to never forget!

""The market is very oversold. We are seeing many technical readings similar
to those we saw at  the bottom of the markets in 1987, 1990, 1994 and 1998.
These are very strong signs of market capitulation.  For example the VIX
(volatility) Index is at a peak that is normally seen at market bottoms.
Short Interest is at record levels - a good sign.  Money Market assets (the
amount of cash on hand), is almost equal to 19% of the entire capitalization
of the stock market - a very high degree of liquidity.
The number of market advisors who are negative on the market, is now greater
than the number who are positive on the market - a traditionally bullish
signal.
The PUT/CALL ratio has been very, very high all week - at turnaround
numbers.
The Fed. has reduced rates now 8 times and liquidity in the system is high.
Inflation is low.
Just when the market is NOT expected to rally, it will. That is the nature
of a bottom.
Let's hope that all these technical readings turn the market sooner rather
than later.  Now is the time.""

IMPACT CALLS

Natural Gas Peggy Connerty
A Safe Harbor in a Storm
We continue to believe the Master Limited Partnership sector will remain a
safe harbor for
investors as the economy teters on the brink of a recession.
Given the possible recessionary environment, Monday's 50 basis point cut in
the federal funds rate (now
3.0%), and the relatively few alternative investments available, we continue
to be bullish on the MLP
sector.
MLP's in general are defensive in nature, provide income and have decent
growth prospects. The cash
distributions on most MLP's are protected with solid coverage ratios (with
distributable cash averaging
115% of cash distribution). Therefore, we believe the MLP sector should hold
up during this time of
economic and political crisis.
Please refer to our note titled ""Weak Economy, Low Interest Rates Bode Well
for MLP's"" published
September 11, 2001.

PC Software - Microsoft 	Michael Stanek
Trimming Estimates to Match Reality
 Trimming estimates to match reality
 We are cutting our estimates for FY02 from of $28.8B to $27.7B in revs and
EPS from $1.93 to $1.86.
 Microsoft has never been as well positioned as it is today.
Overall we have made the majority of our cuts in the December and balance of
the Q's in '02.
The stock is down in the wake of sliding economic conditions, and
exacerbated this recent tragedy.

Imaging Technology - Eastman Kodak Caroline Sabbagha
Tweaking Revised Estimates
With a little more information and insight, we are tweaking our estimates
for 2001 and 2002. For
FY01, our estimate is now $2.60. For FY02, we are lowering our EPS estimate
to $3.20. We maintain
our 3 Market Perform rating.
We think the issues at Kodak are more than just the economy. They include a
technology transition and
competitive pressures in its traditional businesses.
We are also beginning to get concerned about cashflow and therefore expect
the balance sheet to be
weaker than had been anticipated.
We think the stock should settle in the mid-$30s with the 5% dividend yield
acting as a support for the
stock.

New Media/E-Commerce - Amazon 	Holly Becker
Amazon Update
We expect AMZN, like most retailers, will suffer from the current political
unrest. This leads us to
believe that even the low end of guidance of $625-$675mm in revenues may be
difficult to achieve.
Our 4Q ests. for breakeven operating profits and $900mm in cash hinge on our
4Q sales est. of $1.1 B.
While it is too soon to tell, we will likely need to revisit these ests. in
the upcoming weeks.
About 6 weeks ago, AMZN lowered its book prices by approx. 10%. While this
was likely successful in
increasing demand, the recent catastrophe in the U.S. will obviously offset
the benefits.
On Sept. 11, AMZN announced a 5-yr alliance with Target Corp. in which AMZN
will open a Target store at
Amazon.com later this fall and power all of Target's online sites beginning
in summer 2002.
While financially this agreement will be small, we see several strategic
opportunities, which include
expanding into new categories, enhancing direct vendor relationships and the
possibility of utilizing
Target's physical locations.

New Media/E-Commerce - eBay 	Holly Becker
Well Positioned to Sustain Growth
eBay's business appears to be relatively unscathed by the current political
and economic events.
q On Sept. 18, eBay articulated they are comfortable with 3Q consensus of
$186 mm in rev. and $0.11 EPS
(our ests. are $185 mm in rev. and $0.09 EPS).
eBay's listings dropped 30% on Sept. 11, however, the company expects
listings and sales to recover to
pre-Sept. 11 levels in the next few days. We estimate eBay suffered from 1-2
days of lost sales.
Separately, the company announced ambitious plans to raise $100 mm in 100
days in response to the
recent disaster at the World Trade Center.
Dubbed ""Auction for America,"" the campaign enables sellers to list items on
eBay, with resulting proceeds
to be donated to various relief efforts.
The stock is down over 15% since Sept. 11 and is likely to bounce in the
near term, however we remain
cautious given its still rich valuation.

Semiconductor Capital Equipment - Applied Materials		 Edward
White
Announces Layoffs of ~10% Global Workfor
Industry weakness and the events of last week have forced AMAT to change its
strategy and join
its peers in announcing layoffs. We maintain our 1 Strong Buy rating but are
cautious on the
shares near term, given reduced visibility and the fact that shares are
trading at a premium to
historical trough levels.
In an important change in direction, Applied this morning announced layoffs
of ~2,000 employees, roughly
10% of its global workforce. Layoffs will result in a 4Q01 restructuring
charge of an unspecified amount.
Since the last conference call the economic and semiconductor industry
climate has continued to worsen.
This, along with the traqic events of last week, have left AMAT with zero
visibility. No immediate disruption
in business has occurred, the company does expect some indirect impact.
AMAT remains committed to R&D and Field Support Engineers, and this should
help the company ramp
up quickly in the next upturn.

COMPANY / INDUSTRY UPDATE

Wireline Services - Verizon Communications	 Blake Bath
Achieves PA 271 Approval on Schedule
VZ Achieves 271 PA Approval on Schedule; Opens a $5.5B Market and brings its
total approvals to
4 states (NY, CT, MA, PA). VZ is the clear leader in 271 approvals and has
effectively delivered
versus its public guidance in this regard. 271 entry is expected to add 63
bps to '02 total revenue
growth and 84 bps to '02 growth. LD-entry is a major catalyst for VZ and
current valuations are
cheap in the context of the contributions this catalyst should provide for
the company. Reiterate 1-
Strong Buy.
VZ received 271 approval in PA on 9/19, in line with our forecasts, opening
a $5.5B LD voice/data market
for market.
The company also announced that it expects to file with the FCC for 271
approvals in NJ, NH, VT, and RI
between Nov/Dec '01, putting it on schedule for approvals in these states
between Feb/Mar '02.
In total, the PA approval and the upcoming 4 state approvals are expected to
open a $12.7B market to VZ;
in total, by mid-year '02, we expect VZ to be marketing to a new $33.1B LD
market (within the BEL region);
VZ is the leader in 271 approvals.

NOTES FROM TODAY
Cosmetics; Household & Personal Care - Rayovac 		Ann Gillin Lefever
Discretionary Spending Grinds to a Halt
Rayovac's halved earnings expectations for the current quarter suggest both
that consumer
discretionary spending has ground to a halt; and that the retailer is
battening down the hatches by
postponing (and potentially cancelling) orders to further cut working
capital levels.
As we noted yesterday, consumer staples companies tend to outperform during
periods of economic
stress. However, today's news confirms that those with discretionery
spending exposure are less likely to
participate with strong relative earnings growth. We remain concerned about
Gillette's, Energizer's and
Rayovac's exposure to batteries (where we estimate that discretionery
spending is circa 60% of trend
growth) as well as Gillette's exposure to a razor trade up strategy.
Our earnings estimates for ROV change from $1.28 to $1.03 for FY 01 (Sept.)
and from $1.50 to $1.15 for
FY 02. Our FY 02 estimates are $ 0.10 - $0.15 below management's guidance
due mostly to a more
cautious view on battery category growth. Our target has been reduced to $17
and we maintain our Buy
(2) rating.

Gaming & Lodging - Hilton Group	 Joyce Minor
Company Outlines Post-Attack Outlook
Yesterday, Hilton hosted a conference call to update the investment
community on the state of the
company and its operating outlook subsequent to the terrorist attacks of
September 11th.
Although no specific guidance was given, the company is hoping that poor
travel trends last just 6-
12 weeks, followed by a return to normalized travel trends, albeit at a
level stepped-down to 1998-
1999, not the better 2000 trends. If EPS is a guide, note that 1999 EPS of
$0.60 is -17% below our
pre-attack 2002 EPS estimate. Investors that concur with Hilton's hypothesis
that travel fears will
be short-lived should probably buy the stocks at these levels. For those,
like us, that are
concerned that additional events could prolong or renew travel fears, it may
be too early to check
in to the lodging sector.

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production Thomas R. Driscoll
Natural Gas Storage
This week's natural gas storage injection of 90 Bcf was slightly stronger
than our 85 Bcf
expectation.
Oil Services & Drilling - Tidewater James Crandell
Lowering Fiscal 2002 and 2003 EPS Estima
The moderating activity in the Gulf of Mexico is negatively impacting
Tidewater's earnings more
than we previously expected. We continue to believe that improving
international activity and the
start-up of new vessel contracts will partially offset this domestic
moderation. Given that the stock
is currently 50% below its current-cycle high and trading at attractive
levels on anticipated
earnings and cash flow, we believe that the stock is attractively valued at
current levels.
We are again lowering our fiscal 2002 and 2003 earnings estimates to $2.45
(from $2.65) and to $2.65
(from $2.95) to reflect lower-than-expected domestic vessel utilisation
which will lead to downward
pressure on day rates. This follows a earnings reduction last week.
We believe that domestic utilisation will remain weak over the next four
quarters.
Domestic day rates have remained steady to-date but will likely start to
erode in the fourth quarter.

Power - NRG Daniel Ford
NRG Reaffirms Earnings Expectations
We continue to believe that NRG is the most defensive investment in the
IPP/Merchant Sector. We
maintain our Strong Buy with a $23 price target.
In light of last week's tragedy and continued market skittishness regarding
power supply fundamentals in
front of negative GDP predictions, NRG management issued a release to
reconfirm its $1.35 EPS
guidance for 2001 followed by 25% annual growth in 2002 and beyond.
Further management indicated that it terminated its efforts to close on the
Wisvest acquisition (1051MW)
due to insurmountable regulatory hurdles.
We continue to be confident in our 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates for NRG of
$1.40 and $1.78 given
management's conservative and disciplined business approach. This has
enabled the company to time
and time again stand by earnings expectations despite the ever changing
market fundamentals.

Power Daniel Ford
Electric Utilities and Power Weekly
We are previewing the events of the upcoming week of September 24, 2001
We look for the New Jersey BPU to approve the FirstEnergy/GPU merger on
September 26. We also
provide a list of some potential post-merger closing international asset
divestitures.
Parties in New Jersey could submit testimony regarding the Potomac Electric
(POM, Market Perform;
$21.77)/Conectiv (CIV, Market Perform, $23.05) merger proceeding early next
week.

Power - DTE Energy Gregg Orrill
Another Good Yield Hog Story
As an integrated utility with a 4.8% yield, DTE should do well in a
recessionary backdrop. Below
we review the DTE outlook and reiterate our $48 price target which is 11.25x
our 2002E.
DTE is well positioned to do well in the current environment with a
traditional utility focus, a stock buyback
authorization, and a short power position.
DTE had $150M left on the current stock buyback plan and a lingering 10M
share authorization.
Industrial sales are down 10% Y-T-D. However, the lower margin earned on
these customers and DTE's
short position make this a positive impact on the company.
Offsetting factors include lower pension income and outlook for Plug Power.
We reiterate our EPS estimates of $3.54/$4.26 for 2001/2002 respectively.
The MCN acquisition and fuel
cost timing weight more income to Q4 vs. Q3. We look for $0.40-$0.50 in Q3
and $1.60-$1.70 for Q4.

Power Technology - Thomas ONeill
CT DPUC Draft Draws a Blank
CT DPUC releases draft decision that denies FCEL 26MW project entirely.
Reducing shares of
FCEL to Market Perform from Strong Buy due to lack of material catalysts and
potential downside
to $8/share.
Late Wednesday, the CT DPUC issued a draft decision that denied funding to
an ENE/CRRA proposal that
would have resulted in a 26MW order for FuelCell Energy.
While the draft decision could be adjusted to provide funding in a final
decision (early Oct), the wording of
the order appears to point the companies towards additional state funding
vehicles, which would likely take
multiple months to tap and would be speculative at this point.
We believe the disappointing CT DPUC draft decision leaves shares vulnerable
to the downside ($8/share)
and likely caught in a lower trading range until sub MW and MW ""launch size""
order flow can be generated.
That said, FCEL's $7/share of fully diluted cash and leadership in carbonate
technology should limit
downside even in the current market environment.

Banks - First Virginia Banks Kristin Nemec
3Q01 Preview
Although credit experience has been excellent we remain cautious in our
outlook due to the
consumer exposure and lower than average net income growth. FVB is rated
3-Market Perform.
We carry an operating estimate of $0.78, in line with consensus. No change
in our estimates of $3.10 and
$3.35 for 2001 and 2002, respectively.
The balance sheet dynamic is driven by management's decision to pull back in
the indirect auto business
by simply pricing less aggressively. Due to a pullback of many competitors
and the rate environment, we
believe spreads have widened in the indirect business.
We expect the near term expense progression to be minimal.

Banks - Bank One Henry Chip Dickson
Third Quarter Preview
We continue to rate ONE 3 - Market Perform. The deteriorating economic
environment should
cause further downward earnings revisions for ONE, as well as pushing out
the inflection point
when the company really begins to establish EPS momentum. We are also
reducing our target
price $5 to $35.
Given the deteriorating economic environment, we are reducing our estimates
for ONE - assuming higher
credit costs and modestly lower levels of revenue.
For 3Q01, we expect ONE to report $0.60 during the week of October 15. This
represents a reduction of
$0.04 from our previous estimate.
For 2001, we are lowering our estimate $0.10 to $2.40. For 2002, we are
lowering our estimate $0.15 to
$2.75. New GAAP EPS should be $0.03 - $0.04 higher in 2002. We do believe
our 2001 estimate is on
the conservative side.


Biotechnology Joseph Dougherty
Discovery Collaboration with Takeda
The agreement calls for the development of small molecule leads against a
target proprietary to
Takeda. We view this deal as a significant positive for Array, featuring
both excellent deal
structure and potential for future expansion.
This is Array's 4th significant collaboration in the past 2 months that is
tied to potential downstream
revenue participation. We point out to investors that company management had
guided us to expect a
total of 3 royalty-based deals by the end of September, and this
announcement points to possible upside
to our numbers.
We note that Array's shares have sold off more severely than the biotech
group overall, although not to the
extent of some of their competitors. We believe the shares are very
attractive at these levels.

Biotechnology - ImClone Systems Michael Wood
IMCL Signs Strategic Agreement w/BMY
Deal with Bristol Myers will provide $1.0 billion in cash and access to
world class oncology
franchise.
ImClone announced that it has signed a major strategic partnership with
Bristol Myers to commercialize its
lead drug IMC-C225.
ImClone will receive $1.0 billion in upfront and milestone payments. Bristol
Myers will take responsibility for
sales and marketing and will pay ImClone a royalty on net sales.
We are changing our EPS forecasts from ($1.03) loss to ($0.91) loss in 2001,
from ($0.46) loss to $0.16 in
2002, from $0.41 to $0.88 in 2003 and from $1.41 to $1.54 in 2004. We are
instituting a new EPS estimate
of $2.05 in 2005. These latter numbers are fully taxed.
Lehman Brothers acted as financial advisor to Bristol Myers in connection
with this transaction.

Major Pharmaceuticals - Lilly, Eli Charles Butler
SOLD! Oritavancin Out-Licensed to ITMN
Yesterday, LLY announced that InterMune had acquired worldwide rights to
oritavancin, late-stage
Phase III compound under development for complicated skin infections and
bacteremia. We had
anticipated a potential 2004 launch for this compound, thus we are not
changing any near term
revenue or earnings estimates.
The agreement provides InterMune with exclusive worldwide rights to develop,
manufacture and
commercialize oritavancin.
We understand from LLY that NPV analysis supported the licensing of
oritavancin to another party versus
the continued development of this molecule internally.
Additionally, LLY's stable of late stage compounds is extensive. Arguably,
""licensing oritavancin to
InterMune will allow LLY to maximize the full potential of this innovative
compound while the company
redirects its internal resources to other late-stage pipeline opportunities

Health Care Facilities - 	Tenet Healthcare 	Adam Feinstein
Lehman Key Takeaways
THC pre-announced last night that it will exceed est for the recently
completed Aug qtr with a
suggested EPS range of $0.65-$0.67 range, vs our est of $0.63 and the street
consensus of $0.61.
Tenet continues to benefit from accelerating revenue growth trends, improved
cashflow generation, and
debt reduction initiatives.
We note that this news was widely expected by us, as well as others for the
past several weeks. However,
the magnitude of the upside was above our estimate.
The catalyst for this announcement was a desire to repurchase shares under
its share repurchase
program.
We are raising our FY '02 est to $2.83 from $2.80 and we are upticking our
FY '03 est to $3.30 from $3.24.

Autos & Auto Parts - Visteon Corp Darren Kimball
Pre-Announces 3Q01 EPS
VC pre-announced 3Q01 EPS of -$0.46 to -$0.53, compared to our previous
estimate of $0.05,
prompted by Ford's recently announced third quarter production cancellation
of 100,000-120,000
units. This large earnings shortfall implies a steep variable contribution
margin from lost Ford
revenues, estimated at 35%, which is not particularly surprising given the
sudden and dramatic
nature of the production cuts.
For the time being, we are lowering our 2001 EPS estimate from $0.95 to
$0.40 and our 2002 EPS
estimate from $1.40 to $0.95. The potential for additional Ford production
cuts in 4Q01 may lead us to trim
estimates further.
VC's high degree of earnings sensitivity to production volumes, resulting
from the supplier's substantial
operating leverage and depressed margins, makes it one of the most
vulnerable automotive suppliers to a
protracted economic slowdown.

Business & Professional Services - 	Cintas 	dam Waldo
Soft F1Q02; Cutting F2002 and F2003 Est
On September 19, CTAS reported F1Q02 (ended August) revenue of $564.6
million (up 8.2% and, we
estimate, 5.7% organically) relative to our forecast of a 10.5% rise on a
reported basis and an 8%
gain organically. EPS of $0.33 rose 10.6%, $0.01 below our estimate and
in-line with Street
consensus.
F1Q02 marked Cintas' the third straight quarter of decelerating top line
gains in a slowing U.S. economy.
CTAS' two principal drivers of the velocity of top line growth are the pace
of GDP and employment growth,
both of which continue to soften.
Trading at 28 times our new fiscal 2002 EPS of $1.44, 31 times our fiscal
2002 free cash flow forecast, and
a trailing EV/EBITDA ratio of 14.3 times (private market value range of
7-11), we think CTAS is fully valued
despite a ""defensive"" 60% recurring revenue model.
With management following strategies for longer-term shareholder value
creation (nicely improving internal
unit growth, unit pricing, and capital efficiency), we would be buyers in
the low $30s.

Electrical Equipment -	 W.W. Grainger 		Robert Cornell
Review GWW's August '01 Sales/Outlook
Branch Margins Still The Key
q Grainger's August sales were off modestly, but did not weaken
significantly beyond July sales trends.
North American economic weakness continues to impact sales while seasonal
sales improved.
Branch saw moderate sales decrease. Company helped by diversified customer
base. Management
maintains margin targets.
q Digital sales continues to improve to $460 million annualized run rate.
Grainger.com increased run rate to
$350 million.
We are maintaining our 2001 EPS estimate of $2.25 and 2002 EPS forecast of
$2.70, which suggests a
20% gain. Price target at $50.

Electrical Equipment -	 SPX Corp 	Robert Cornell
Our 2002 earnings number remains $7.50
Stock looks oversold at current levels
SPX's INRANGE subsidiary guides revenues down and points to a potential $4
million in freight forwarding
costs.
Worst case scenario looks to be a $0.15 impact to SPX's 3Q01 earnings.
Cost cutting initiatives as well as United Dominion integration savings
could help support bottom line
results.
We are maintaining our $6.50 2001 EPS estimate and our $7.50 2002 EPS
forecast.

Machinery -	 Caterpillar 		Joel Tiss
Still Waiting...
CAT shares have declined over 20% during the past few weeks from $56, yet we
are still waiting
patiently to buy trying to minimize downside risk.
It is difficult to ascertain if recent events will change the long term
construction trends as economic
weakness may accelerate potentially setting up recovery in late 2002-03.
Government construction
spending should remain strong.
Downside risk in shares remains $30. We would be much more interested in
buying below $40 and would
become more aggressive in the low to mid $30's. However, nibbling in the low
to mid $40's may not be the
worst idea.
Believe upside stock potential remains $65-70, mid decade, based on $6.50
peak EPS - however timing of
peak earnings is more of a question than levels.

Advertising & Marketing Services Kevin Sullivan
Global ad stocks continue to come under pressure following last week's
attacks on ""Old Glory"".
The sell-off creates a compelling investment opportunity among the stronger
names such as
Omnicom.
Last week's events came at a difficult time for media stocks -- the ad
market was still weak and consumer
and business confidence was rocked -- both key elements in the resurgence of
industry growth.
Consensus estimates have become that much more challenging. For the ad
holding companies, we
believe the near-term impact is minimal since the vast majority of the
group's revenues are fee-based.
However, the potential for additional pullbacks in ad spending further
supports our belief of downside risk
in 4Q/'02 estimates.
Valuations have largely already adjusted for this risk, in our view. Our
favorite name continues to be OMC,
which is trading at less than 9x our '02 EBITDA estimate. The stock appears
to be discounting the worst
and we would recommend investors use the weakness as an opportunity to
accumulate positions.

Entertainment - 	Disney 		Stuart Linde
Keeping It All in Perspective-Balancing
We believe that at current levels, Disney encapsulates most of the downside
risk of the U.S.
recession and the terrorism threat. As opposed to its peers, Disney has the
added risk of a decline
in domestic and international travel to its theme parks.
About 80% of the company's EBITDA is generated by theme parks and
broadcasting. The theme parks are
about 40% of DIS' annual EBITDA. In 1991, theme park EBITDA dropped 30%.
We believe the studio and consumer divisions could offset some of the loss.
The studio will be bolstered by
releases such as Monsters Inc., (in Nov.) and continuing DVD sales propelled
by the Platinum Collection.
In this difficult period people need entertainment and fantasy especially of
the wholesome, uplifting,
signature Disney genre.
While the stock has begun to discount lower 2002 expectations. Investors are
looking to identify downside
support for ent. cos such as DIS. In our sensitivity analysis, we have used
a trough multiple of 10x and
varied EBITDA by $200 MM increments. If we assume EBITDA declines 20% to $4
Bil, the trough on the
stock using this analysis is $15.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute ""john.doe"" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in ""corp/your user id"" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You will now be able to view your mailbox.

	

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the functions NOT available via OWA:

"Quicksilver Resources","Ken and Jeff:

Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.  Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.  Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.

Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties. Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).  Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.  Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.  Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.  I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.

If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.  However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.  As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.

I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.  Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.  Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Thanks.

Jim Hughes

"Clinton Energy Vacation Policy & Request","I have held discussions with Tim Weithman, Ashley Kerr & Ken Brooks (immediate supervisor) regarding a request for vacation for the 3rd or 4th week in May. I have been told recently by both Ms. Kerr as well as Mr. Weithman that those of us being severed from the company are not permitted to take any vacation time between now and June 1st. It would seem that there are several inconsistencies regarding Enron policy as well as how the subject was presented both to the group as well as individually. Below are the inconsistencies I speak of.

During the group meeting in the beginning of April there was no mention of ""vacation freezes"". The only reference to time that was mentioned was that you must be employed by Enron as of June 1, 2001 to receive the severance package.
During my private discussion, in which both Ms. Kerr and Ms. Gray were present, I was presented with the specifics of the severance package. I specifically remember being asked for my current unused vacation amount. I gave them the amount of 152 hours and was told that I would be reimbursed for that total unless, of course, I took any additional vacation. This implied that regular Enron vacation policies would be in effect. Again, at no time was it presented to me that I was ineligible to take ANY of my earned vacation or that there would be any deviations from normal Enron policy regarding vacation.
At no time has Mr. Weithman, Ms. Gray, Ms. Kerr or any other Enron agent made public a policy of vacation freezes.
At no time were there ever any public or private requests that the plans for those with previously scheduled vacations to be made available to any Enron agent.
I can find nothing in my severance package that states any deviation from the standard Enron vacation policy.
I realize that Enron policy requires vacation approval from the supervising employee. It states in that policy the following:
""An employee's preference for scheduling vacation should be adopted when possible.""
""The supervisor must verify that unit staffing needs are met before approving an employee's vacation request.""
I am currently still an Enron employee.  I have also verified that staffing needs are met. 

In summary, as you can see there are several inconsistencies with regards to the vacation policy for those being severed at Clinton Energy. It more than offends me that I am being prohibited from taken ANY part of the 152 hours of accrued vacation that is, by all accounts, mine to take. This being said, I am formally requesting one last time that I be granted my vacation request during the month of May. Furthermore I would like this approval as soon as possible so that I may make necessary arrangements. As you review this I am consulting an attorney so that I may be advised of my rights regarding this matter.

Thank you,

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Howdy,
 
Thought I'd give my new scanner a try and also send you a copy of an article I wrote in Turkish for a magazine with which Ismail is involved.  Supposedly, I will be writing a page long article every month.  Two so far.  The idea is that even though my Turkish is flawed, it is good enough to communicate the impressions of a foreigner and presumably do so in a rawer, more authentic fashion.  Who knows?  But at least its good practice and approximates the process of writing in English.  
 
Can you let me know whether you were able to see the article?
 
Fondly,
 
Mark

"All The Color Of The Season","
		 	
		[IMAGE] 	
[IMAGE]	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeff Skilling,   Now that fall is finally here, it is time to showcase  the season?s brilliant color. Decorators in the know accentuate  this changing season with the high-energy hues of gold, burgundy,  orange and yellow. Calyx & Corolla has taken their cue. We  offer a divine medley of colorful bouquets, preserved designs  and even bulb kits paying tribute to fall.   Our Williamsburg  Bouquet  (shown right) is a stunning assortment of terra cotta  colored roses, golden Peruvian lilies, russet hypericum berries  and unusual velvety orange coxcomb. It truly recreates the look  of the pedigreed blooms found in the historical manor homes of  Virginia. The exceptional crackle-finish footed urn in which it  is displayed is adapted from those in the European market circa  1800.    Our sweet Rose  Spice Wreath  brings a concentration of fall color to a small  area while our Golden  Harvest Roses  proclaim the season in a riotous display. Combining  ruffled yellow roses with flaming orange roses it's a wonderful  choice for any occasion   We're pleased to introduce our new Ranunculus  Bulb Kit . This sophisticated flower is well known for its  dense, round heads of distinctive crepe paper-like petals and  has been noted by many trend watchers for its growing popularity.  Our kit is a unique take on these blooms and makes a perfect gift,  especially for those with children.   We invite you to visit our Sale page for limited-time offers  & our Birthdays   page for darling gift-giving ideas.    Calyx  & Corolla   	[IMAGE]

Amelia--It is at the Fox studio (4261 Southwest Freeway).  The segment is at
6:45 a.m., but the riders need to be at the studio at 6:15 a.m.  The riders
should wear biking gear (Enron jerseys would be adorable!) and bring their
bikes if possible.  Lanny Griffith will interview the riders after the
weather segment!  I am sorry this is so short notice!  Any help would be
great!

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks!!!

"POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family","POWER POINTS: Skilling Moves On To Charities, Family
   By Mark Golden
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Jeff Skilling will be spending the next few years
working with charities in Houston and spending time with family, the former
chief executive of Enron Corp. (ENE) said in an interview.
  The 47-year-old Skilling, who resigned abruptly from Enron after the
company's
board meeting Aug. 14, repeatedly said he had left - as stated - for
personal
reasons. Wall Street has been skeptical of the explanation, and several
analysts
have said they're waiting for ""the other shoe to drop."" The company's stock
price fell 14% in response to the announcement last week - a loss of about
$4.5
billion in shareholder value - and hasn't recovered this week.
  But the former chief executive said the stock price will recover once
investors see that his departure isn't a precursor to more bad news for the
company.
  ""I've spent the last 34 years working really hard,"" said Skilling, who
requested the interview with Dow Jones Newswires. ""There are a lot of things
that I haven't been doing - personal interests, spending time with family.
There
are a number of charitable things that I haven't spent the time on that I
believe I should. I don't mean fundraising, but hands on, getting out and
doing
things, building houses, helping individuals.""
  Skilling, who has been involved with a multiple sclerosis charity for
years,
said he plans to get involved in promoting the City of Houston.
  ""It's massively underrated as a place to work and live,"" he said. ""It's a
great city, and I think I can do a lot to get that across.""
  Though insistent that there is nothing more to his departure than personal
reasons, Skilling said little to reveal why a talented executive would
surrender
the top spot of the country's largest energy trading company just six months
after taking the job. Skilling had been Enron's No. 2 executive from 1997
until
this year, and he's generally credited with the success of Enron's wholesale
trading operations, which comprise about 80% of the parent's earnings.
  He confirmed there's no crisis in his family, and his health is fine.
Skilling, who assumed the chief executive title on Feb. 12, also denied that
he
was suffering under the strain of the job.
  Late last week, Chairman Kenneth Lay and other Enron executives in New
York
told Wall Street analysts that Skilling had been going ""kind of nuts"" under
the
pressure of being chief executive, one analyst said.
  ""It's not true that I was cracking up,"" he said. ""Do I sound like someone
who
is cracking up? The representation of me as thick-skinned is a reasonable
representation.""
  When asked if his departure could have been handled more smoothly so as
not to
alarm investors, Skilling said that perhaps the mechanics could have been
better, but said that is hindsight.
  ""We thought it through and thought we were going about it in the right
way,""
he said. ""I don't know what we could have done differently. It will turn
out, in
retrospect, fine, as soon as people see that there's nothing else.""

   About One Week's Notice

  The former chief executive totally disagreed with speculation in this
column
last week that Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who immediately resumed the role
of
chief executive, may have wanted to regain day-to-day control of the company
and
pushed Skilling out.
  ""I think the world of Ken. You can't find a bigger fan of his than me,"" he
said. ""I was not forced out. Personal and family reasons are 100% of the
story.
I guess it's kind of mundane, and I'm sorry it doesn't have as much drama
and
suspense as a lot of people would like it to have, but that's what the deal
is.""
  Skilling said he spoke with Lay about wanting to do other things many
times
over the years. The first serious discussion of his imminent departure came
about a week before the announcement, said Skilling, whose recollection of
his
giving notice to Lay was somewhat cloudy.
  ""The board knew what was going on, and that was the point (the Aug. 14
board
meeting) where the decisions were going to be made,"" he said.
  The decisions?
  ""I guess to accept my resignation,"" Skilling said.
  Enron refused to release a copy of the minutes of the Aug. 14 board
meeting,
which was regularly scheduled. The company doesn't generally release
board-meeting minutes, spokeswoman Karen Denne said.
  The former chief executive continues to work as a paid adviser to Enron. A
clause in his contract prevents him from competing with the company through
the
end of 2003, and he has no plans to work outside the energy industry.
  That might sound like a big comedown from running the country's most
aggressive energy company, but Skilling said the move fits.
  ""Some people say 'Well, you were working and aspiring so long to become
CEO of
Enron.' That's not true. I was working to build a business, and we did,""
said
Skilling, who is credited with transforming the company into a trading
powerhouse.
  ""The company I built is doing great. My life is moving on.""
  He also said the company will do fine without him. Some analysts have
expressed concern about Enron's ability to retain its top talent. Skilling's
predecessor as Enron's No. 2 executive, Richard Kinder, for example, left
the
company in 1996 after Lay announced that he would be retaining the chief
executive spot for another five years. Kinder went on to buy Enron's small
liquids pipeline business and turned that company into Kinder-Morgan Inc.
(KMI).
  Enron's current management, Skilling said, has a ""very deep bench."" For
example, he described Enron Energy Services Chief Executive Dave Delaney as
""awesome.""
  ""Dave created the Canadian business in Enron,"" Skilling said.

time.

Brothers,
It has come to my attention that either our YahooGroup is not working,
or you are not communicating.  So this message is a Search for
ExtraTerrestial Intelligence among the select Betas that make up this
august group. I will even count terrestial intelligence this time.

What with Homecoming only 5 days away, we figured there would be some
message traffic on eWooglin.

Hit reply when you see this message to let me know if there is life
out there.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay
connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's
incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it
up right where they left off years ago.

Dear Mr Jeffrey K Skilling:

There's plenty of advice for managers floating around out there...some of it very good and some of it downright disastrous.  The trick, of course, is knowing which is which.

That's exactly what Harvard professor Chris Argyris proposes to show you in his new book, Flawed Advice and the Management Trap: How Managers Can Know When They're Getting Good Advice and When They're Not.  For more details, read the book review section in the current issue of strategy+business.

In the same issue, you'll find a generous handful of other great books discussed. The Knowing-Doing Gap: How Smart Companies Turn Knowledge into Action is a good example...so is Silicon Valley's New Immigrant Entrepreneurs, by AnnaLee Saxenian.  And you won't want to miss the s+b review of The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life or Absolut: Biography of a Bottle.

Reviews of important business books are just part of the reason strategy+business is eagerly awaited by the select group of influential senior executives to whom we regularly send complimentary issues.

While we're on the subject of complimentary issues, I should mention that our records indicate you have been receiving s+b since Jun 16 00.  There is no reason why you cannot keep receiving strategy+business absolutely free...especially if you make arrangements now.

To make sure you continue receiving your complimentary strategy+business subscription, just click on the following link:

http://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/cg.cfm?D=20010605163716&N=4232025.0&R=380.0

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

"IF there is something useful I can do...","Jeff,
Thanks for being on the panel at the CEO Forum.  I really appreciated
getting to hear the Enron story and talk through the talent issues with you.
At my end, I am targeting my time to work with a few executive teams who are
looking to forge a consensus response to problematic issues around managing
for shareholder value, dealing with the ""nasty bit,"" and managing context so
that it does not overtake core.  If I could ever be of use to you at Enron,
it would be a privilege.
Cheers,
Geoff

"Lockyer Fires Earthy Attack at Energy Exec","
Jeff
 
FYI - Strong and colorful words  from a powerful man.
 
Given Lockyer's abilities,  position and and ambition, I would advise building bridges and mending fences  while this is still at the taunting stage.  He wants your  attention.  Knowing him, I'd say that a direct and friendly  call from you or Ken today, followed by a meeting would go a long  way.

Gen. Bill  Lockyer this week suggested the chairman of a Houston-based power company  should be locked in a prison cell with an amorous, tattooed inmate named  Spike.       Lockyer, who is investigating  whether energy firms have manipulated prices on the wholesale electricity  market, made the comment in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that  appeared Tuesday.       ""I would love to  personally escort [Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8-by-10 cell  that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is Spike,  honey,' "" Lockyer said.       Enron spokesman  Mark Palmer called the comment ""counterproductive rhetoric"" that ""does not  merit a response.""       But other industry  representatives denounced the remark as ""outrageous,"" especially because  neither Lockyer's office nor any investigative panel has filed charges  against Enron or other companies.       ""You'd  expect that the state's chief legal counsel would file charges first and  make public statements second,"" said Gary Ackerman of the Western Power  Trading Forum, an association of energy producers and traders. ""We're very  disappointed with his choice of words, which don't exactly fit the profile  of his office.""       In an interview Tuesday,  Lockyer said he decided to ""ratchet up"" the commentary to ""put [energy  companies] on notice"" that ""we are not afraid of them and have the will to  prosecute.""       ""What I'm trying to do is  let these economic buccaneers understand that if we catch them, they're  going to be prosecuted,"" Lockyer said. ""Just because they're  multimillionaires and run big corporations, it doesn't provide them with  immunity.""       The attorney general is  investigating whether power company officials tried to maximize profits  through illegal manipulation of prices on the wholesale energy market.  Several panels, including a state Senate committee and the California  Public Utilities Commission, are conducting similar probes.        On Tuesday, Lockyer announced that three  power companies have agreed to turn over documents subpoenaed months ago  by his investigators. The attorney general went to court to obtain the  documents after the companies failed to meet a March 19 deadline to hand  them over.       Lockyer said the forthcoming  documents would help his office as it sifts through mountains of evidence  in search of possible violations of antitrust or unfair business practice  laws.       ""Evidence is accumulating that  certainly infers illegal activity,"" Lockyer said. ""But we need to make  sure it's compelling and clear enough that you can convince a jury.""        Lockyer said he singled out Enron's  chairman because the Houston company is the world's largest energy trader.        At least one observer found Lockyer's  comments refreshingly candid. Harry Snyder, a senior advocate of Consumers  Union, said, ""Let Lockyer be Lockyer.""  * * *      Times staff writer Dan  Morain contributed to this story.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"[smu-betas] RE: new members (Justin Loweth)","Brother Betas,
It sounds as if I will be a fresh fish in your established group.  I
graduated from SMU in December of 2000 and am currently working in
Houston.  I am originally from Houston as I am sure at least a couple
of you are as well.
During my tenure at SMU I served as Treasurer of the Gamma Omega
chapter my sophomore year and then went on to serve as Treasurer and
Secretary of the Interfraternity Council through my junior and senior
years.  I now look back on my days as a Beta and wonder what I was
thinking when I decided to graduate.  The friendships I made and
times I enjoyed will stay with me through my life.
I am also one of the two co-organizers of what I would like to see
become an annual Beta tradition, the Distinguished Beta Award.  An
event held to honor one of our brothers who have distinguished
themselves as exemplary and provide a setting to rekindle old
friendships as well as have a great time.  As I am sure some of you
were part of the list of people I called last month to inform you
that the event had been postponed until this upcoming spring, which
has proved to be a blessing in light of the tragic events that
occurred Sept. 11, I would hope that this website may become a forum
to both share ideas on the future of the event and information in
regards to the event.
I hope this provides a good base in giving all of you with a brief
synopsis of who I am and how you may or may not have crossed paths
with me in the past.

Yours in Kai,
Justin Loweth

it is the preferred site for the proposed Blanton Museum.  The tower will
never glow orange again.  It's also on the second tier target list for the

I heard about your departure from Enron two weeks ago.  I was very
surprised. It must have been a very difficult decision for you as I know
how much of your heart and soul your poured into transforming Enron into
the preeminent company that it is now.  I hope that you are very proud of
what you accomplished over the past 12+ years.  I have never come across
a management team that even approaches the quality of you, John
Esslinger, Ken Lay and Rich Kinder.  I have also never come across a
business visionary anywhere near you and I expect that I, and everybody
else, will see you accomplish great things again.  But whatever you do, I
hope that this message finds you feeling well and happy.

"Mischer Healthcare","Dear Jeff,

I sent you a presentation concerning InterFit Health which is the diagnostic
screening company we discussed months ago. There are two issues I would like
to address: I. Are you interested in investing? 2. I would like to present
to Enron our scope of services which will in all certainty provide lower
healthcare cost and greater productivity. The cost of our biometric testing
is very modest in comparison to your total health costs and leads to
designing your benefits program with disease risk knowledge vs. shooting in
the dark. This is a truly unique approach which is why JP Morgan Chase,
Reliant, and Halliburton have become clients of the company in the last
month. I know that you are very time constrained so if you cannot address
this with me please refer me to another Enron officer who has bottom line
responsibility for your healthcare costs. The same information was sent to
Ken and I have placed a call to him. I appreciate your considering our
services.

Best regards,

Walt

Dear Jeff,
 
I worked at McKinsey (NY/FI) during 1985-91 and have  since founded and run an IT systems integration company called Techna in Silicon  Valley, with clients worldwide and Purnendu (""PC"") Chatterjee (ex McK and  affiliated with Soros' funds) as an equity partner. 
We have been working closely with Sempra Energy trading  for the past couple of years and are beginning an engagement with NYMEX soon.  Our president, Ben Bernstein (ex Microsoft) has been managing these clients on  the east coast personally. Ben and I feel that we have interesting ideas in IT  for Enron from our experience in this industry thus far, and would appreciate  your indulgence in getting us in touch with the appropriate IT leaders at Enron  for us to make a pitch. 
Your achievements at Enron since leaving McKinsey  have deservedly won you quite a fan following! As an unabashed member of  this group, I would love to hear from you anyway, when you find a moment in your  busy day.
Best regards.

Survived my trip back and a week alone with the kiddies while Nina was out
at her conference in Corsica.  Just got notified that the first film I sent
off to shutterfly is available.  There are some really great photos from the
wedding day.  I'm sending you the link (by separate email)  if you're
interested and will make copies of the likely photos for you and rebecca
once I've gotten all the rolls processed.  If you see any in particular that
you like, let me know and I'll get copies made of those too.  (There's a
really good one of the two of you with Shukran!)

I really enjoyed hanging out with both of you and am looking forward to
seeing you one of these days in SF.  I don't have rebecca's email.  Please
sent her my love.

"RIDE START NEWS !!!","The composition of the ride start has a slightly different twist and I wanted you to know exactly what to expect.  Enron is still on tap for ""first out the gate"" and will follow the same schedule I've already sent out - staging for exit at 6:45 am.

BP also has a very large team.  They they will gather at the BP building on Memorial, and come into the start from Dairy Ashford. We think it is appropriate for them to start just before us to honor their sponsorship role in the bike tour.  They will start from their assembly area on the street, and we will be first out the gate.  Thank you BP!!

PLEASE PROMINENTLY DISPLAY YOUR MAXINE MESSINGER RIBBON ON YOUR JERSEY.  We have a photo opportunity with the Houston Chronicle, the sponsor of these ribbons, and it is important to the theme of the ride start for everyone to have them on their bike jerseys.  I'll have some extras there if possible.  The Chronicle will recognize Enron as the top funds contributor to the MS Society in 2000, and we would also like to honor Maxine (Miss Moonlight) at this special moment.  Miss Moonlight recently died from MS.  She covered the celebrity beat for the Chronicle for decades with honesty, loyalty and a spirit of fun.  With unflinching spirit, Maxine faced MS head on, never letting it rob her of her joy, and always generously supporting the cause for a cure.  Miss Moonlight's spirit rides with every one of you who is so generously giving your time, talent, and fundraising energy to this cause.

THANK YOU, and THANK YOU FOR RIDING WITH ENRON !!

"Votenet Announces Online Voter Registration Software in Spanish","
For Immediate Release  Friday, October 12, 2001  	Media Contact: Michael Mack Vice President of Business Development Phone: (202) 207-0540 michael.mack@votenet.com http://www.votenet.com   	


Votenet Announces Online Voter Registration Software in Spanish

Washington, D.C. - In support of today's White House celebration of the National Hispanic Heritage Month, Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce the Spanish language version of its pioneering Votenet Voter Registration software. The Spanish speaking population in the United States increased by an unprecedented 13 million or 62 % from 22 million in 1990 to 35 million in 2000! The political ramifications of this demographic change are expected to be far reaching. The first step in becoming an involved and informed citizen is registering to vote.  Votenet's Registro De Votacion will provide Hispanic Americans a streamlined and simplified approach to the voter registration process. 
Associations and advocacy groups can add the online voter registration software to their web sites for as little as $995.00 per year.  The features in Spanish include: 
Register to vote  
Report a name change to the voter registration office 
Report a change of address to the voter registration office 
Register with a political party 

Votenet's Voter Registration software will have a dramatic impact in areas with large Hispanic populations including: Florida, Texas, New York, and California.  All of these areas were critical in the 2000 election cycle.  ""With only 50% of Americans voting at the national level, this software enhancement has the ability to raise that number significantly,"" stated Mitch Reisberg, Vice President of Votenet's Sales. 
""We are very excited about adding the Voter Registration in Spanish capability to the Votenet suite of public policy solutions. We believe this product enhancement will add a unique dynamic to voter activism.  All American citizens should exercise their right to vote and Votenet Voter Registration facilitates the first step; registering to vote.  This Spanish language version recognizes the reality that the Hispanic population is the fastest growing segment in the United States,"" said Glen Hughlette, President and CEO of Votenet Solutions. 
The online Voter Registration product, in English and/or Spanish, is available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by visiting either http://www.votenet.com  or calling 1-800-VOTENET.

"You did a great job as CEO","Jeff,
 
Just wanted to let you know that you did a great job as CEO. I don't think Enron would be in position to have a goal of being the world's leading company without you and all you have done for Enron.
 
I read you recently became engaged. Congradulations! That's exciting news. Maybe that played a role in your decision. It will be great to have more time to spend with her. 
 
I also read that the Teeside incident was the last straw. That is good to know that we had such a sensitive and caring leader. That will be missed.
 
Best wishes for you and your finance'.
I'll be praying for you.

There are some internet gurus working on e:mail from Mars.  I would like to know if Enron has plans on getting involved in  interplanetary communication.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Howdy everybody,
It has been just over a month since we married.  Been a few growing together pains, but mostly full-on bliss.  Nice not having to say goodbye at the bus-stop.  Sukran truly darling.  The family thing is fine too; her folks very nice and her brothers and respective families nicer still. (My best friend, Ismail, has meet them and agrees too, and we suspect that Sukran might have [unintentionally] exaggerated a bit the extent of her pre-me suffering.)  
At the wedding Jeff and Sue played the roles of family representatives perfectly and everyone, including Rebecca and Misha, helped me focus on the matters that were.  I was and am very grateful; had been torn, thinking that I would have to juggle two families, but we all came together in a very warm, memorable way -- e.g. Sue in locked-eyed first embrace with veiled-mom; all of us one evening while at Sukran's parent's house, after our religious marriage by an imam (with muezzin), in a animated two or so hour discussion about religion, our lives etc., with me struggling to translate.  We all, Jeff in particular, impressed and honored by the fact that Sukran's parents -- both of whom have paticipated in a pilgrimage to Mecca -- shared with us holy water brought back from that same city.
Italy excellent.  Nonetheless, Sukran missed family and Turkey a lot.  I think the marvel that is Italy will grow in her memory; its one of those plant the seeds kind of things.  We rented a car after a couple of nights in Rome, then to Sienna for a night (Sukran found it a bit creepy), Florence for two (I am not a big fan of the place [too many tourists, like us, and related infrastructure] but enjoyed it none the less), Venice for two (a great theme park) then down the Adriatic coast to a sweet little village, Sirola (on a cliff top over-looking the sea), for two more.  Crossing the boot back to Rome, we spent a night in another sometimes creepy middle-ages flavored hill-top village called Todi.  
Since then, back to a not so busy work schedule at the office.  Sukran at her job for another month, then quits to begin a hopefully well-rounded life of quasi-scholarly leisure.  
Despite Italy's charms, we were thrilled to get back to Istanbul; Sukran's brothers and their wives met us the airport; after a bit of catch-up chitchat we said goodbye to them at the ferry, then a giddy Sukran and I crossed the marvelous Bosphorus to our new home and life, which is good.      
And yours?
With love,
Mark and Sukran

Caroline JoeDale Bob on who I spent all my aluminum can money , sending her to Boston College, & Holly JoeDale Bob who will use up the winnings from the chicken fights sending her to college in South Carolina, then there is little Tommy Joe Dale Bob who takes after me; he gets the Double wide when I'm gone, and special  Janie Jane Jane Joe Dale Bob our baby who works down at the A&W to support our propane usage.   But surely there is more to Life.  Had I not consumed all those free beers at Gordos I would have had more of those brain cells and I too could have been as successful as the Betas that followed me. I feel so inadequate when I am invariably compared to the likes of Strobes,  Dent, Rocky, and you know there's Drow plus that most successful Clay Coburn.  I will feel like the impudent Senior Citizen I am when Johnny Miller pulls up the Internet link to his front-page success article and the others in the class of the class of 75.

"Re: [smu-betas] Sad day for Auburn Betas","Brother Shackleton, it's your kind of thinking that lead to this discussion.
You know damn well the THE REASON that the Black fraternity with no white
members exists on the Auburn campus is because there are none of the Miami
Triad members or any other national fraternities on that campus who pledge
Blacks.  So, don't be so stupid with your inane comment about the fact that
the Black fraternity has no ""white guys"" as members.  Before you stepped
foot on the campus at SMU, there was an occasion when there was a very sharp
Black guy who registered for and came through rush.  Surprisingly, there
were several of us (including yours truly - an original New Orleans biggot

we should invite him back for the house party.  I remember vividly the
incredible outlash when we stood before our brothers and tried to convince
them to ignore the fact that this guy was Black.  We got hooted down and he
was BALLED!  And, I have no doubts after reading your immature remark that
the same would have taken place during your tenure as an active at Gamma
Omega.  So, get a life, Ace.  It's 2001 and counting.  How many Black

"Re: Chase Marc Shapiro call to Jeff Skilling","Angela, if in your view, the issues brought up by Chase are an underlying dissatisfaction with the ""entire"" agreement, particularily the commodity ""savings and advice"" component, perhaps it would be advantageous for both Enron and Chase to sit down and re-negotiate.  From our point of view, given the execution and contract issues we currently have with the contract, this may be a win-win for the companies.  Let's sit down and discuss strategy - if you think it would be advantageous, I will replace Tom as senior level contact.

As per my voice mail from this weekend, I would like to get ahead of the potential issues brewing at a number of the other accounts particularily Starwood.

I agree with your perception that Chase feels they are not getting financial and construction value; they also feel there was other  value promised them -- such as , in Manny's words, "" strategic commodity management"" , i.e.,  insights into, and advice on,  how to respond to changes in the commodity market.

I am requesting that Dag hold off on contacting Manny until Dag and I have met.  I know that we were scheduled to meet  on Tuesday to discuss these very issues but I can move this up to Monday morning.  

 Dag and Cindy have dramatically improved the quality of our billing efforts but the basic contract structure precludes us from ever achieving  customer satisfaction (perfection).    

 I really believe the underlying issue here is that Chase perceives they are not receiving the financial value they had anticipated from the commodity and construction agreements.  We presented a report to them last week that would support their position.  The lack of value created coupled with the  billing issues and a vacancy in senior sponsorship seems to have created the tension that ultimately could put us in a good position to re-negotiate this deal.

 We have identified several areas of contract restructure that will create immediate value for Chase and Enron, eliminate the billing issues and provide them the visibility into the financial performance of the agreement they have been requesting.  

Jeremy has a strong relationship with Mark Shapiro and should be leveraged here.  We need to make sure our response to Mark maximizes the opportunity to get everybody back to the table. 

I am going to the esource conference nex t week with Manny Patino, where he is presenting .  The main reason I am going is  damage control as many of our competitors  will be there and it is my intention to stay close to Manny. (a great heads up from Peggy).

Subject:	Chase Marc Shapiro call to Jeff Skilling

Jeff Skilling called me this afternoon to say that he received a call from Chase Vice Chairman Marc Shapiro. Shapiro said that Chase was upset about:

1. Tom White and Gary Provo no longer being involved with the Chase account

2. Billing errors (unspecified problems)

I explained to Jeff that:

1. Chase wants someone at the Tom White level to continue to be their senior contact; Jeff said that that Dave might want to perform that function

2. We have made major improvements with the billing but we have not reached perfection; perfection is what Chase wants.

Next Steps:

1. We will have to let Chase know who will be their Tom White level contact.

2. Dag Joraholmen will contact Manny Patino at Chase to get specifics on the billing issues and with Evan's team determine what can be done to address such specifics.

"FW: ENA Research: Argentina default and devaluation risk rises.  Brazil feels the effects of the contagion","Gentlemen,

Conditions in Argentina have improved slightly overnight as government and opposition forces have agreed, in principal, to reduce the budget deficit (Gwyn's fourth bullet point).  However, I'm concerned about Gwyn's third bullet point that bank deposits are being converted to dollars as well as being withdrawn from the banking system.  I've heard market rumors supporting this latter point.

Gentlemen,

This is a good review about the financial risks in the Southern Cone.  Thoughts in the market last week involved a special Fed meeting about Argentina but no information was provided to the public.  Brazil's currency is the second worst performing currency thusfar this year, right behind Turkey.

Subject:	ENA Research: Argentina default and devaluation risk rises.  Brazil feels the effects of the contagion 

Date: 12 July 2001

From: Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
         Gwyn Koepke

We believe that the risk of an Argentine debt default has increased and peso devaluation risk has also risen substantially in the last several days.

Due to recent economic and fiscal developments in Argentina, we believe:

Argentina lacks the fiscal and monetary maneuverability to lift itself out of a 3-year recession (exacerbated by a global slowdown) and a strong peso.  Argentina's fiscal position has weakened substantially due to economic weakness that limits government revenue receipts needed to balance the fiscal deficit and pay off the country's debt service.  A loss of investor confidence has caused spreads to widen despite Argentina's need to rollover about $8bn of short-term Letes (Argentine government debt) by the end of the year.  Yields paid at this week's Treasury auction are at levels that are not sustainable over the medium-term.  Three-month Treasury yields are 14.01% (versus 9.1% paid at auction on June 26 and 7.89% on June 12).  In addition to suffering from widening yields, Argentina was forced to shorten the tenor of debt from a mix of 6-month and 1-year bonds issued previously to only 3-month securities at this week's auction due to increased risk aversion to longer-term government paper by local investors (pension funds and banks).  The sharp increase in Letes yields, and the inability to issue longer maturities, is highly indicative of the difficulty the Argentine government will have in rolling over $8bn in short-term paper over the remainder of the year at sustainable rates, which further weakens its fiscal position due to higher interest payments.  
The recession has been exacerbated by the strong peso caused by the persistently strong US dollar, which has hurt Argentina's export competitiveness especially vis-a-vis the Brazilian real that has depreciated about 25% relative to the USD since the beginning of the year.  As a result to these factors, we believe the risks of Argentine debt default and peso devaluation are mounting.  
Argentina is increasingly vulnerable to a run on the banking system.  Argentines are switching from peso to dollar deposits.  Argentina's limited forex reserves constrain the central bank's ability to support the peso, if private sector deposits are withdrawn or converted into U.S. dollars.  Private sector deposits of $74bn are 33% peso-denominated, or $25bn, and 67% are foreign currency-denominated deposits, which dwarf Argentina's official forex reserves of $25bn.  Total private sector deposits fell about $5bn (from $77.5bn to $72.4bn) between February and end-April this year before stabilizing at $74bn as of July 6th.   
Political uncertainty is very high and throws into serious doubt Economic Minister Cavallo's ability to win opposition support for a new fiscal austerity program announced late yesterday.  Cavallo needs to win approval for his fiscal agenda not only at the national level, but also at the provincial level, which will not be easy considering the 3-year contraction.  Failure to gain this support to cutback spending will worsen Argentina's fiscal woes, and cause a further deterioration of investor confidence.
These external and internal pressures leave the exchange rate vulnerable to speculative attack and threaten the 1-to-1 dollar peg, especially in light of the country's limited foreign exchange reserves.  Today, Argentina's 1-month NDF traded at P1.15, implying risk of a 15% devaluation, while yesterday, the 1-month NDF traded at P1.05 (implying an increased probability of devaluation since yesterday).  Also today, the 1-year NDF traded at 1.25, implying a 25% devaluation.  As a result of these above internal and external pressures, we believe the risk of peso devaluation has increased substantially.
The danger of a steep devaluation is that private sector firms that hold dollar-denominated debt and are long pesos and short dollars will suffer from sharply higher debt payments.  This could cripple an already tenuous economic situation by causing a further deterioration in government revenue through lower tax receipts.

Developments in Argentina impact Brazil through 3 main channels:

Currency Volatility: Contagion from Argentina has lead to a substantially weaker Brazilian real.  Triggered by a general sell off of Argentine stocks, bonds and currency, the real has depreciated 24% since the beginning of the year to close today at R2.55.  To stem the real's recent decline, central bank President Fraga hiked interest rates 150 bp and simultaneously intervened in the forex market June 22, which stemmed the real's depreciation for about one week (see GMM, 29 June).  Recent currency volatility could result in further central bank intervention by drawing on Brazil's forex reserves.  Fraga has indicated the central bank will intervene to support the real's value.  A weak real will also translate into higher inflation expectations in Brazil.
Emerging market credit spreads: Argentina represents about 25% of total emerging market debt traded.  Current investor concern about Argentina has consequently widened emerging market debt spreads.  Wider spreads put upward pressure on overnight rates in Brazil, reducing liquidity and increasing costs of debt service in Brazil.
Trade mechanism: Further downward pressure on economic output in Brazil (already aggravated by the drought-induced energy crisis) brought on by weaker export market growth to Argentina.  Also, the weaker Argentine peso would reduce Brazil's export competitiveness within the Mercosur trade bloc.

This week's GMM will contain more details on the contagion effects on Brazil as well as Argentina's disappointing Treasury bill auction, the trend in private sector deposits, Cavallo's new fiscal measures to cut spending, Argentina's heightened political risk associated with the need for fiscal austerity amid concerns over provincial political support and S&P's debt downgrade to ""B-"", which is one notch below Moody's rating of ""B2"".

"Re: [smu-betas] Fwd: President Bush","Hess, 
Thanks for your words of encouragement. I knew Gary Vale from a distance and feel sorrow for his death. I am confident in saying that all of us have a Gary Vale in our lives. It may be a family member, close friend or a colleague at work. You're not alone in second guessing yourself. I have asked myself several times, what if I only extended a Christian hand and tried to help this person, I could have possibly made a difference in the outcome. As I have slowly learned since my college days, your either a Minister for Christ or your need one. That role can of course reverse on any given day. 
Sorry you can't make it to BIG D for Homecoming, but your not missing much since the 76ers are whimmping out. How pathetic.

 At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years ago.

"DINNER IN LA GRANGE","
Dinner in LaGrange will be a great affair.  Randy Gross of the Enron Aviation Department will again provide us with his fabulous barbecued brisket and sausage.  The Marriott will be there with some great side dishes and some chicken thing that I know will be wonderful as well.

J. Paul Oxer is once again Camp Director and has some great improvements to the 2001 tent.  Heather Choate is the Volunteer Coordinator for the 65 operations volunteers in Bellville, LaGrange and Austin.  Thanks to all!

IT IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS DINNER IS PROVIDED FOR ENRON RIDERS AND QUALIFIED VOLUNTEERS ONLY.  Many of you have family and friends gathering in LaGrange with you, and they are welcome to visit us in the tent, but we can't feed them.  We will need to strictly guard against the possibility of running out of food before the last rider comes in.  As a means to control this, if you are not wearing an Enron cycling jersey or an Enron Cycling Club volunteer t-shirt, your name will be checked on a master list before you are invited to participate in the dinner.  Since all our volunteers do not know you, please don't be offended when they check the list for your name if you are not wearing an Enron jersey.

PLEASE DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THIS.  IT'S NOT THAT WE ARE INHOSPITABLE, IT'S THAT WE ARE IN A REMOTE LOCATION WHERE REPLENISHMENT OF OUR FOOD SUPPLY IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND WE DO NOT WANT TO TURN A TIRED, HUNGRY RIDER OR VOLUNTEER AWAY FROM THE TABLE.

THERE IS FOOD AVAILABLE FOR YOUR FAMILY AND FRIENDS THROUGH THE MAIN DINING PROVIDED BY THE MS SOCIETY, AND YOU CAN GET THE LOCATION FROM OUR INFORMATION BOOTH IN THE TENT.  THE CHARGE IS $5 FOR DINNER, AND $3 FOR BREAKFAST FOR NON-RIDERS.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION !!

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
	The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of your
application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can substantially
improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
	All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA Tour,
of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.  The
Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

SnapStream Media - Personal Video Server Technology

SnapStream Media's goal is to use its proprietary networked video management
and streaming technology to become a major infrastructure player in the
booming markets of home digital media delivery and viewing. Chosen as a
finalist for Best of Show at the Consumer Electronics Show 2001, SnapStream
Media software enables any network appliance to watch or stream video over
wireless and wired networks. SnapStream's technology delivers the only
network-centric media solution in the market. More than 150,000 users have
downloaded SnapStream's software since its first beta release and reviews
have been written by both PC Magazine and PC World.

Product

		SnapStream Personal Video Station (PVS) serves as a personal
network-based repository of digital media. Content can be recorded from a
variety of sources including satellite, cable and antenna. Additionally,
through content partnerships, shows can also be ""recorded"" via a user's
broadband connection.
		The SnapStream.NET Back-end Services allows the company to
provide a variety of services including collection of viewing patterns and
statistics, delivery of customized advertising, and network-based delivery
of video content.
		The company is pursuing a strategy of bundling and
co-marketing to achieve penetration into the market.  In the short-term,
revenues of approximately $5 / subscriber / month will be derived for
services associated with SnapStream PVS.  Longer term, revenues will be
derived from the network-based delivery of video (movies, television shows,
news broadcasts, etc.) to the SnapStream base of viewers.

Market

		The target market is the exploding market of digital media
consumers.
		The Internet appliance market is forecasted to grow to $17.8
billion by 2004 (IDC**)
		Handheld device unit sales doubled in 2000 from 3.6M units
in 1999 to 6.9M units and are expected to grow to 33.5M units ($26B sales)
by 2004 (IDC*).
		The nascent digital home entertainment network market will
grow to $3.3 billion from 2001 to 2004 (Parks and Associates)
		By 2004, home networking device shipments are expected to
reach 29.8M, and 17.6M U.S. homes are expected to have home networks (IDC*).
		Annual shipments of digital video recorders are expected to
reach 12.9M by 2004 (IDC*).

Strategic Partners

		SnapStream Media has established bundling agreements with
leading TV tuner card manufacturers. One partner, Hauppauge Computer Works,
is the U.S. market-leading manufacturer for TV tuner cards.
		The company is in advanced discussions with Intel
Corporation around the bundling of PVS software with Intel Anypoint Home
Networking hardware. The company is also in high-level discussions with
other key home networking companies including 3Com and Linksys.

Competition

		SnapStream's competitors are in the convergence media space
and include companies such as Mediabolic, ZapMedia, and SonicBlue.
		Except for SonicBlue, all companies are in their early
stages and have not begun product sales.
		The technologies and products of these convergence media
companies address only digital audio (as opposed to digital video) giving
SnapStream a strong early-mover advantage.
		SnapStream Media holds technical expertise in the area of
streaming video, rivaled only by streaming video companies Microsoft, Apple
and Real Networks, making it difficult for other companies to compete
		SnapStream's support of consumer operating systems from
Microsoft make it convenient and cost-effective for its software to be
bundled with PCs from companies such as HP, Gateway, Compaq and Dell.
		The company's pending patent covering its networked video
platform will allow the company to further impose barriers to entry for
existing and new market players.
Competitive Advantages

		Network Video Technology - To date, SnapStream Media's
]existing streaming server currently available to the consumer market. Its
networked personal television software (SnapStream PVS) is something for
which the company has filed a patent to protect its intellectual property
position.
		Early Mover Advantage - As discussed above, the company has
a substantial lead in both vision and implemented technology in the area of
digital and networked video in the home.

Hey  All:  hope this finds you doing well  and getting ready for cooler weather.   A Closer Look is entering it's 8th year, but the  real
purpose  of this e-mail is to announce the launch of our new sister website,  WiseShops.  This is an  e-commerce site where a business owner can order a professional mystery shop  on-line.  After the order is placed  on-line at our secure website, it is then filled with one of our qualified  shoppers. I value your opinion and would really appreciate it if you would do  two things:
 
Access  the website, www.WiseShops.com   and let me know what you think about  the site and the concept.  Any and  all feedback would be helpful.   
Forward  this e-mail and the site to anyone who you think might benefit from  professional feedback for his/her company.  If they do not own a restaurant,  hotel, or retail establishment, we will be adding a number of other types of  businesses in the very near future.

 
Looking  forward to hearing from you and thanks for your  help,

"Pie In The Face","Dear Jeff,

You may recognize my name as a member of the Houston YPO chapter.   We met briefly at the April technology program, which by the way, was fascinating.
I
  read in the Houston Business Journal of the San Francisco pie incident and thought your follow-through on the speech was perfect.  Look at the bright side, you're in great company!

I'm writing to solicit your advice on how my business can best capitalize on the ever-changing energy business.  As some background information, I'm responsible for a group of companies that are primarily in the businesses of manufacturing, personalizing and mailing laser printed billing statements and credit cards.   Personix is an industry leader in the markets we serve and Enron is a larger user of the types of services our company provides.   At the present time, we do not do business with Enron.

I've read where Enron has established an electricity retailing operation in anticipation of the Texas electricity market deregulation.  We would like to discuss with the appropriate person in your organization how our billing statement solutions may be of interest to Enron for your various energy and broadband businesses.

I would appreciate it if you could pass our name along in order to advance these discussions.   Thanks and look forward to seeing you at the next YPO event.

Regards,

Jorge Diaz

"last week's breakfast- energy opportunity","Jeff,
Last Wednesday morning, I was fortunate to share breakfast with you.  I thoroughly enjoyed the hour that you spent with us.  

At the end of the hour, I gave to you a one page summary of a tremendous energy devise that has received extreme interest from the likes of Conoco, Anadarko, and Texaco.  As I quickly mentioned, the inventor of this geothermal apparatus is in town this week.

Have you had the opportunity to quickly review this paper?  If so, do you feel as though Enron might have some interest in further discussions with the inventors?  This could be a tremendous new, innovative opportunity for Enron.

I look forward to your response.

"An employee from OPO Dabhol.","How I wish all the bosses treat their employees as the man in this story did!!!
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
First-Day Employee

My father had a small business, employing approximately fifteen people at any given time.  We pasteurized and homogenized milk from farmers each morning, and put it into bottles for home use and for restaurants.  We also put the milk into small containers for the school kids everyday.  We also made a wonderful little thing called homemade ice cream.  We sold all of these milk products, and many more, in the front of a dairy building, which had been fashioned into a small store with a large soda fountain.  During the summer months, there were rows and rows of eager tourists lined up at the ice cream counter, waiting for their daily indulgence of my father's most exquisite recipes of some twenty-seven flavors of homemade wonder.

Being such an extremely busy little store meant that the employees had to work fast and furious for hours at a time, with little rest.  The swarm of tourists never stopped and our ""rush hour"" lasted many hours on hot days.

I had worked for my father since I was young, as did all seven kids in our family.  So I had seen many new employees come and go due to the fast and frenetic pace. One day, in 1967, we had a new employee, Debbie, who wanted to work in the store for the summer.  She had never done this type of work before, but planned to give it her all.

On her first day, Debbie made just about every mistake in the book.  She added the sales wrong on the cash register, she charged the wrong prices for items, she gave the wrong bag of food to the wrong customer, and she dropped and broke a half-gallon of milk.  The torture of watching her struggle was too much for me.  I went into my father's office and said, ""Please go out there and put her out of her misery.""  I expected him to walk right into the store and fire her on the spot.  Since my father's office was situated within view of the sales counter, he had no doubt seen what I was talking about. He sat, thoughtful, for a moment.  Then he got up from his desk and walked over to Debbie, who was standing behind the counter.

""Debbie,"" he said, as he put his hand gently on her shoulder.  ""I have been watching you all day, and I saw how you treated Mrs. Forbush.""

Debbie's face began to flush and tears began to well in her eyes as she struggled to remember Mrs. Forbush from the many women she had given the wrong change to or spilled milk on.

My father continued, ""I've never seen Mrs. Forbush be so polite to any one of my employees before.  You really knew how to handle her.  I am sure that she is going to want you to wait on her every time she comes in.  Keep up the good work.""

In return for being a wise and compassionate employer, my father got a loyal, and hardworking employee for sixteen years...and a friend for life.

"Meeting question.","During a recent visit to the EBS Information Security
team, it was realized that during the EBS
""redeployment""  about 75% of their teams resources
were cut, and now with the recent attacks/breakin's on
Enron resources (Routers, servers, clients) are there
any plans to bring that team back up to full
staffing??  It's my understanding that this team had
identified various risks and vulnerabilities in the
past, however without the proper manpower how is EBS
going to ensure security is not overlooked and these
breakin's do not continue?

"National Power Delivery Opportunities","
Dear Mr.. Skilling,
Given the current events of the last several years  regarding power generation and delivery across our nation, I have a  proposal, I'm sure will interest you. 
First, with your position with Enron, you must be keenly aware of the issues  that we face as a nation, and direct impact which the energy markets  have on our economic health.  Additionally, you must also be aware of the  capacity imbalance from region to region, lack of capital improvements  by the incumbent utilities, ISO's etc, all of which has created a situation that  our national grid is in a state of degradation, in which even the delivery and  transfer of existing capacity is questionable, must less the additional  generation which is being added. This has rendered our national grid, with its  many segmented regions to slightly above that of a third world nation. 
This lack of capital investment has been exacerbated by a lack of clear  direction by the vast number of regulatory bodies, and general lack of  aggressive entrepreneurial motivation and vision by the various utilities to  develop creative solutions to issues which they have a vested interest to  resolve, but haven't. It appears that there are vast  opportunities available to an aggressive, first mover organization which  can pull together the resources,  and bring all the players together along  with the capital markets to initiate, develop and build additional capacity or  to enhance the existing power delivery and transfer. 
While the Bush Energy Policy goes a long way towards bringing federal backing  to developing additional generation capacity, it appears to fall short regarding  the transmission systems that cross our nation,  of which many are already  straining under a heavy load, which is only anticipated to grow.   Additional transmission capacity must be built, including additional  interconnects between the various grids and/or existed interconnects  strengthened.  The ability to transfer power from the east coast to the  west coast, as the power demand peak moves across the country from the east, or  the ability to transfer power from such area's as Nova Scotia which has an  abundant supply of inexpensive Hydro Power would certainly be the ideal  situation.
What I propose, is the development of a new Enron company, of which its  vision would be to identify and develop opportunities to build various  transmission assets, and/or additional generation capacity or to strengthen  existing assets.  This would be accomplished by bringing various players  together under the Enron lead,  and working with the capital markets to  develop a strategy, allowing for the asset to be built. All the while keeping in  mind, the asset light and capital velocity approach. It would be the goal of  this new organization, not to own the physical asset, but to retain  the rights to a portion of its capacity. This capacity could then be  traded or used for power transfers from regions with inexpensive supplies to  areas that shortages exist.  I envision long term inexpensive contracts for  Nova Scotia hydropower; being transferred to such area's as New York,  the  Midwest, or even California.
While such an idea is not unique,  with several proposals   being considered by various organizations across our country. Such as the  following:

Path 15, long recognized as the major  transfer constraint between North and Southern California. Recently, WAPA has  issued a solicitation for equity participation, in which private organizations  could participate, in the financing, building  and ownership with  rights to its capacity. http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-IMPACT/2001/June/Day-13/i14874.htm 
Neptune Project a private initiative in the New England states being  proposed by a group of companies, mostly non-utility for except ABB. This  project has recently been approved by FERC and is currently soliciting bids  for capacity rights, ownership, etc. http://www.neptunerts.com/ 
 
TransAmerica Project another private  initiative being proposed by Black & Vetch along with Siemens. The  scope of this project is to build a DC line between the east/west grids,  thereby allowing a transfer capacity increase to 6000 MW. This project has  already been presented to the National Energy Committee put together by  President Bush as a viable project and potential solution. http://www.bv.com/bv/news/pressrel/2001/bv_siemn.htm 

 
While great idea's are plentiful, the problem is funding from the capital  markets, or an organization with proven leadership and track record to pull  off such a project.
This is just the beginning, and given the historical lack of investment in  the grid, many more opportunities will had by an aggressive organization with  the foresight to put together the team to capture them as they come  available. I envision that this organization would work in conjunction with  TranConnect , which Portland General is currently a member, in order to expand  or compliment their efforts. 
It's my opinion and that of many others, that the only organization on this  planet, with the financial strength, entrepreneurial vision, superior management  along with political clout, to pull all the components together to make  this a success, is Enron. 
As a former Enron employee,  I am extremely familiar with a number of  the organizations, which make up Enron, and feel that this would certainly  compliment or augment existing operations.  
While I'm not with Enron as this time, I certainly am proud of the  contributions I made while with such a progressive organization and I am  extremely interested in meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss  this proposal and it's fit into overall Enron strategic plan. 
For further discussion, I can be contacted at (602) 758-4544 (Cell) 
Regards,
Mike Stefanik

"Parent Child Mountain Adventure, July 21-25, 2001","Please respond to Keith_Williams""A YPO International Event""

www.myypo.org/solutions

Would an investment of five days be worth a comment from your child such as

""Dad, this is the best trip I've ever been on."" Michael Montgomery, son of
YPOer William Montgomery (Cincinnati)

Or would that same five days with your child be valuable if you could say:

""It was clear that each parent and child had shared a special time that
could only be experienced in the wilderness.  Away from television, the
Internet and the conveniences we mistake as necessities, we all
rediscovered the simple pleasures of conversation and time together.""  Tonn
Ostergard (Nebraska)

Enjoy the splendor of the Rocky Mountains in a program exclusively designed
for you or your spouse and your child.  As you rock climb, rappel, hike and
backpack you will strengthen your family bonds as you are physically
challenged in this rugged yet beautiful environment.  Your nights will be
spent under the stars as you tell stories around a roaring campfire, play
games and enjoy fellowship with other YPO families.

For fourteen years, the Parent Child Mountain Adventure has helped
facilitate stronger one-on-one family bonding experiences for over 300 YPO
members and their children.  Professional guides from Young Life's
Wilderness Ranch guide YPOers and their children through the three-day
journey.  This is not a luxury retreat.  You will wear your sweaty cap as a
badge of courage and pride.  Flexibility and laid back leadership will be
your chief assets as you and your child learn more about each other.... and
you will learn more about yourself.

I just found a lost BETA living in my backyard  in Edmond Oklahoma.
It seems that Steven M Ellsworth has been an Okie since  1996. I spoke with him this morning and he would like to get  together with fellow OK BETAS for some -KAI-.
 
So I am proposing a 2001 SPACE Odyssee  -KAI-fest   on or about September 8th at my house. 
 
I am located just off the turnpike that runs between  Oklahoma City and Tulsa.  Thats an hour and a half drive from  Tulsa.  I am 20 minutes from Nichols Hills and Quail Creek.  I  figure there are at least 10 of you out there.

"JPMorganChase Bank","Jeff, 

My sister is a Vice President for JPMorgan Chase Bank, and she supervises construction and management of new buildings in Texas. She sent me the following note regarding Enron Energy Services' handling of their utility bills:

""On another note:  Enron handles the utility bills for JPMorganChase Bank on
a national basis, including Texas.  We are building a call center in San
Antonio, and the City of San Antonio (municipal electric) wants to charge
us a $50,000 deposit for new power because 11 out of the last 12 payments
made by Enron have been late, and late fees have been paid.  I am now going
to do an analysis on all of my regions.  I would like a local Enron
contact, if one exists.  Any ideas?""

Whom in Enron should I tell her to contact?

Thanks,

"Re: [smu-betas] SETI via eWooglin","Yes, Elvis is still alive and reading these pussy-ass messages. To the class of 76-so, where are the freaking parties this weekend. You 76ers are still worms. Last year the class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1 year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on Sunday morning.

"[smu-betas] Third time's the charm they say","Bothers,
    After seeing my first son pledge Phi Sig at Georgia Tech 6 years ago,
then my second boy pledge UCLA baseball four years ago, it is with great
pride I announce that young Joe Berry  just accepted a bid to become a
member of Beta Theta Pi at Auburn University.  He called me tonight with the
news and it is just sinking in as I type this.  I figured it would be the
last thing he would do, due to his persistent individualism all his life.
It's a really neat feeling to have a son as a Beta.  Very difficult to
describe.  Thank God I'm a Beta and I hope to be a better one.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow


PS.  He first told me he had pledged Sigma Chi, his pledge class was 47, but
only 30 expect to make it through, that 3 of the actives are known
homosexuals, one of his pledge brothers is a midget, that pledge football
practices are at 5:30 a.m. (mandatory) and he would have to drop one of his
classes to get through pledgeship.  I pretty much bought all of it until the
dropping of the class bit.  Guess Joe has been paying attention all along to
the concept of the Beta Dick.

"David Doctor & Genscape, Inc.","
September  13, 2001
 
 
Dear  Jeff:
 
I know  with your departure from Enron tomorrow and with the loss of friends and  business associates on Tuesday you have much on your mind.  For those  reasons, I hesitate to contact you now, but realize from my personal experiences  that this may be the very time at which you wish to consider  opportunities.  I have briefly outlined below my present venture.  I  am asking energy industry acquaintances for assistance in identifying  prospective investors.  In your case, you may wish to consider an  investment and, if you desire further involvement, the company will offer you  one of its five Board seats.  I wish you well in your future personal and  professional endeavors.
  
I am CEO  of Genscape, Inc., a two-year old, $3 million annualized revenue, energy  information provider, serving Fortune 500 companies.  Genscape has  delivered and deployed proprietary technology making it the exclusive provider  of real-time online power generating and transmission operating information.  Energy traders have shown great interest in Genscape's information with five of  the nation's largest energy traders subscribing to the service at annual prices  of $500,000 or more. With only $200,000 in equity investment to date, Genscape  has developed its proprietary technology, organized a 27 person staff, completed  one third of its monitor deployment and generated strong customer demand.  It's a great start upon which to base  expansion.
 
Genscape  and Vectren Energy Solutions, have reached an agreement as to the terms for  issuance of $3 million of Series A Preferred Stock of which Vectren will buy  half. A copy of the term sheet signed is attached. Vectren was the principal  investor in EnTrade Corporation, of which I was a founder, and realized a  significant return in EnTrade's strategic sale to Tenneco Energy. Genscape has  also received strong interest from a financial investor for $500,000. Due  diligence and closing documents are substantially complete and this transaction  is ready to close by late September.
 
Genscape  is seeking the remaining $1 million of investment capital required and will  accept $100,000 minimum investments. I need your assistance during the next few  days to identify individuals or businesses that may wish to make such an  investment.  I will contact them  personally, once you provide me their contact  information.
 
I plan  to be in Houston on Friday, September 14, and at least one day during the week  of September 17 and can meet with prospective investors personally, if they  desire.
 
David A.  Doctor
Chief  Executive Officer
Genscape,  Inc.

FINE !..........I always liked you better when I thought you were from Summit, NJ. The reason for the question, d---head, was since I didn't get a response from Mr. Haulenbeek I thought , perhaps, I wasn't reaching him, especially since there had been some talk about some Betas no longer being on the list, etc, so there. And please say HELLO to the very lovely Margaret.

That was my good friend Luca Baldisserri, who is the chief  engineer for Ferrari and won almost everything these past few years with his  driver Michael Schumacher...Luca is likely the best car engineer in the world,  and is interested to join me in the future as a partner to operate a team in the  U.S. based CART ""IndyCar"" series...
 
I invited you both as our sport requires strong corporate  partners to function... and thought you may have interest with knowledge that  you would be working with some of the best people in the world... which would  make it reasonable to achieve a very positive return on any corporate  investment.
 
Please feel welcome to keep in touch... and to join us  for a race this summer if you wish.
 
Best to you

Woody,
Good work on making contact with Joe Parks and successfully recruiting
him as a new member of EWooglin.com.
On the strength of your success, I started searching the Internet and
Louisville for Caldwell Willig.  The last time I saw him was in NYC in
the late seventies...the result of a chance meeting on the street after a
get together of metropolitan area Betas.  Zeebs will remember.  It was
the night I told the Long Island duck joke at a crowed restaurant in his
home town (inhibitions were low as usual).
""Where is Caldwell Willig?""  Is this our Caldwell Willig
(http://louisville.bcentral.com/louisville/stories/1998/08/03/story6.html
), or is our Caldwell a ""Jr."", ""II"", ""III"" or 'IV""?
Any insight brothers?...let me know.

BEN  POURBABAI

BenPourbabai@aol.com 
Home (202) 965-3696l Cell: (703) 593-4854 

June 18, 2001 
Dear Mr. Skilling: 
  
I would like to explore the possibility of joining your organization as a  
senior technology executive.  
I have more than 16 years of experience, including 11 years as a senior  
executive: 3 years as Director of an academic R&D center at University of  
Maryland, 3 years as a Vice President of a systems-integration company, and 5  
years as a senior technology executive at US Department of Transportation  
(i.e., Chief Scientific and Technical Advisor). I do have hands-on experience  
in design, development, and implementation of advanced technologies,  
including complex products and processes, and introduction of automation  
technologies. I refer to the term ""automation"" as the process of designing,  
developing, and implementing all the relevant complementary  
(information-based) technologies and systems (i.e., software and hardware)  
that are required to speed up the process of performing a specific manual  
task.    
As a technology executive, I address IT and other relevant technology  
concerns from a holistic perspective, based on an open-system architecture,  
so that as the enterprise evolves, introduction of new technologies (i.e.,  
hardware, software, and communication systems)  would not inhibit future  
growth of the enterprise. I am also committed to proposing and implementing  
uniformly accepted international standards for development of new products  
and services (i.e., software, hardware, systems, and any combination of them)  
in order to guarantee quality and reliability of the products and services,  
accordingly. Furthermore, I am committed to assess and quantify the expected  
consequences (i.e., cost, schedule, performance, reliability and quality  
control concerns) associated with adoption of new technologies prior to  
selecting and committing to those technologies, so that future growth and  
financial revenues would not be unexpectedly interrupted due to emergence of  
more cost effective (competing) technologies elsewhere.  
My organization is responsible to independently monitor, evaluate, and  
officially certify aerospace products (i.e., hardware and software systems as  
well as the commercial aircraft, rotorcraft, and their parts) during design,  
manufacturing, and support phases of their life cycles, in the US and abroad.  
To address a subset of these concerns, I collaborate with the senior  
executive of the commercial aerospace industry and other US Departments and  
federal agencies, including Defense, NASA, and Commerce, and when necessary,  
I assist and advise them accordingly. In my official capacity, aside from my  
executive responsibilities, I monitor and assess the state of art IT,  
automation, and real-time quality assurance technologies in the aerospace  
sector and when necessary, I advise their senior executives accordingly.   
I am responsible to coordinate R&D activities of the FAA's National Centers  
of Excellence including: National Center of Excellence for Aviation  
Operations Research, Joint Center of Excellence in Computational Modeling of  
Aircraft Structures; and  Airworthiness Assurance Center of Excellence, while  
promoting government-industry-university sponsored research and education.  
Furthermore, I collaborate with DARPA and other federal agencies on  
assessment and development of advanced systems and telecommunication  
technologies, including wireless broadband telecommunication technologies  
(Particularly for avionics and real-time entertainment applications), Next  
Generation Internet (NGI), Network Management. I am also familiar with the  
underlying operations, manufacturing and quality control concerns  
corresponding to the life cycles of such products. I am a member of the  
National Science Academy's Transportation Research Board (TRB), and work  
closely with NASA's Ames center at Moffet-Field on advanced information and  
avionics systems for design, development, and prototyping of the next  
generation of advanced aviation support systems.I have also designed and  
implemented advanced web-enabled logistics systems, web-enabled Supply Chain  
Management systems, and web-enabled real-time quality control & surveillance  
systems.  
I have extensive outsourcing, procurement, and acquisition management  
experience in both private sector and the government in domains of  
information and communications systems, and have extensive hands-on  
experience with outsourcing and contracting. I have contributed to  
improvement of US Government's (multibillion $) aerospace acquisition  
management, and have contributed to revision and improvement of the FAA's  
acquisition management system for procurement of advanced information  
systems. I have also been instrumental in implementation of ISO standards in  
the aerospace sector. 
Please let me know if I can provide you with additional information. I can be  
reached either at (202) 965-3696 or (703) 593-4854. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, 
Ben Pourbabai

"Re: [smu-betas] SETI via eWooglin","Shacklepuss,
    I made the grave error of not checking my email for the past three days
and then pull it up only to find about 4,000 Beta replies to your whiny ass
plea for somebody to talk to.  My theory is you were just feeling very
lonely and blue, and missed some serious homosexual overtures from the bros.
  Well, it worked.....will have to remember that the next time I'm feeling
lonely and blue.

Yours in -kai-,
Drow

PS. Chuckles, can't BELIEVE you actually put your brother's address and
phone number on the website.  If any of these gorillas actually show up and
scratch one of his precious autos or spray paint one of his fricking Van
Gogh's,  he'll just shit!!

******************************************************************************
Last year, only 6% of all venture funding from across the US went to companies with women CEOs.  Only 41% of companies that received venture capital had women within their executive ranks.  When it comes to raising venture capital, women-led firms still have a lot of catching up to do in order to narrow the gap.
 
Houston Technology Center is pleased to announce our involvement with a venture capital forum that is taking proactive measures to narrow that gap-- Springboard: Southwest 2002.  In the one-day forum produced by the Forum for Women Entrepreneurs-Texas and the Springboard Venture Forum Series, an audience of over 250 corporate, venture and angel investors will evaluate investment opportunities from 20 of the top women-led companies from Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, Arizona and New Mexico.
 
Springboard Enterprises is a national non-profit venture whose  mission is to increase women's participation in equity capital markets.  Springboard Enterprises' six forums to date have showcased 175 women entrepreneurs and have resulted in women-led ventures raising over $450 million in funding.  Judging by this record, HTC is optimistic that Springboard: Southwest 2002 has great potential for accelerating the growth of local women-led ventures and for narrowing the gap in Houston and across the state.
 
To build awareness of and excitement for the Forum, which will be held in March 2002 in Dallas, HTC is hosting the Houston Launch Event on October 2, 2001 at The Houstonian.  Registration will begin at 2:30 p.m., with the entrepreneurial educational program beginning at 3:00 p.m. and lasting until 6:30 p.m., including a reception for all stakeholders.  Your key questions about accessing funding and the current landscape of venture capital will be answered by a first-class panel of investors and experienced entrepreneurs including:
 
Teresa Bosco
Partner, Houston Partners
 
Nancy Chang, Ph.D.
CEO, Tanox, Inc.
 
Marc Geller
Managing Director, Sternhill Partners
 
Paul Hobby
Chairman, Genesis Park LP
 
Billy Ladin
CEO, Houston Entrepreneurs Foundation
Founder, PDQ.net
 
Dennis Murphree
Managing Partner, Murphree Venture Partners
 
Barbara Paige
Vice President

Donna Romer
Entrepreneur-in-Residence, Eastwest Venture Group
 
Moderators:
Lloyd Bentsen, III
President, Triad Ventures
Chairman, Houston Technology Center
 
Paul Frison
President and CEO, Houston Technology Center
 
The  Launch Event brings together the region's entrepreneurs, investors and professional service firms for the purpose of making connections.  While the Forum is still several months away, now is the time for women-led ventures, investors and professional service firms to learn about the opportunities Springboard offers.  Leading investors and professional service consultants are already enlisting to screen the 500 plus applications and to coach the entrepreneurs selected to present at the Forum.  
 
To register for the Houston Launch event, click on this link to the FWE web site: http://www.fwe.org/pages/calEvent.asp?CID=551&isFwe=yes&mo=10&yr=2001&pageID.

"HBS Ballot Letter","Dear HBS Club Members:

My term as President of the HBS Club of Houston is rapidly nearing its
completion.  Thank you for helping make it a wonderful year and a great
experience for me.

The Directors and Officers have worked hard instituting new programs in an
effort to make membership in the club a valuable experience.  We began the
year with several goals:

?  Increase membership by offering a more varied program of interest to a
broader cross-section of alumni
?  To increase average event attendance by having renowned speakers talk on
provocative topics
?  To increase participation from a number of segments within our club
?  Young Alumni (less than 10 years since graduation)
?  Non-MBA alumni
?  To change the experience to allow more relationship building among alumni

Our hard work has paid off and we owe our members many thanks for their
support and confidence.  Membership this year approached 300 people, up
from 268 the prior year.  Attendance per event is up 14% over historical
averages.  We have added two new programs  the breakfast club and the
social hours.  Breakfast club membership stands at 42, exceeding our
expectations.  Social hour participation averages about 15 to 20 while
showing signs of acceptance and growth.

I would like to thank the officers for their assistance and support.  Each
of them has worked hard to make this a great year for our members.
?  Sean Daichman - Treasurer, Breakfast Club and Energy Finance Panel
?  Nisha Desai - Monthly Socials
?  Anuj Gupta - Dot.com Panel
?  Kim Kehoe - Monthly Socials, Bob Stobaugh event
?  Steve Latham - Venture Capital Panel
?  John Meckert - Applicant Reception
?  Stuart Page - Website
?  Elliott Smith - Directory

I would also like to thank our Board of Directors.  They have provided
valuable direction for improving the club's value to its members.  In
particular, I would like to thank our outgoing directors - Chuck Bratka,
David Daniel, Cathryn Rodd and Susan Rheney.  I would also like to
recognize Osmar Abib and Kevin Bartol for helping to organize and ensure
the success of the breakfast club.

Finally, I would like to thank Dottie Kerr for helping with all of the
administrative support.  Organizing events is a critical function with many
details to make things run smoothly.  Dottie and her daughters eased the
burden on the club's officers substantially.

We have worked with the nominating committee of the Board to identify a
slate of officers and directors for next year.  We believe that those
people on the ballot will continue to build the club into one of the
premier alumni clubs in the country.

To simplify the voting process, if you choose to vote by e-mail, you may
vote for the entire slate of officers and directors by typing the word AYE
followed by your name on the Subject line before replying to Dottie.
Otherwise, please complete the ballot and fax to 281-424-4770 or email
dottie@kerr-solutions.com by June 8, 2001.

Thank you again for your support and for allowing me to serve you during
the past year.

Kindest regards,

George Laflin

"[smu-betas] Drow breaks out the lunch box","Drow,
When I opened your email, I figured you'd clear the confusion about
membership order in the upper 400's since you have access to the Gamma Omega
registry.  And being the ex-Pres you know the official ruling on pledge
order.  But then I realized ""waaiit a minute, Drow won't give a flying ef
about that,
he'll probably hang someone instead.""  Nailed it. Hung the Okies, lyin' old
bastards, the Exxon queen, and mopped us all with the homo sobriquet in less
than 100 words.   Still on top of your game. So, now that you got the
revenue machine rolling again, do we have to pay you for short stories or
are you going drag your sorry, tired ass up to the PC every night and keep
us entertained regularly for free?  I think we all know the answer to that
one, 'cause I used to be the Treasurer for these homos and they only paid
enough to keep Elzie and brothers awash in beer. Hell, we were so strapped
we had to tape the stolen McDonalds flag over the broken window in the Beta
house shower to keep from freezing our sacks.  Sorry the retirement ended,
but you gotta love that new revenue.  Stay in touch, bro.

"The Morning Market Call - Tuesday October 2nd, 2001.","
			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

The Federal Reserve has just cut interest rates by 50 basis points. This was
pretty much expected. In the statement, the Fed. members indicated that the
""terrorist attacks have significantly heightened uncertainty in an economy
that was already weak. Business and household spending as a consequence are
being further damped. Nonetheless, the long-term prospects for productivity
growth and the economy remain favorable and should become evident once the
unusual forces restraining demand abate"".

The 30 -year bond yield is 5.32%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.51%.
The 5-year is trading at 3.74%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $22.75 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.26 p/mcf



IMPACT CALLS

REITs 		David Harris
War and Recession
q Although we remain bullish on REITs, the onset of war and recession has
caused us to adopt a
more defensive posture within the group. As a consequence, we have cut our
mid-year 02 price
target for the RMS to 430-440 from 450-460 allowing for about a 10% return
from here. REITs
proved their mettle by declining by only 1.4% between 9/10-9/28 compared to
a 4.7% drop in the
S&P 500.
q We have cut 02 FFO estimates across the board and now forecast a gain of
4.8% compared to 7.9% three
weeks ago. Save for a few NYC office co's, the economic environment has
deteriorated.
q To reflect our new view we have downgraded industrials AMB from a 1-Strong
Buy to a 2-Buy and CNT
from a 2-Buy to 3-Mkt. Pfm. We downgraded office co's BXP and SLG from a 1-
Strong Buy to a 2- Buy
and downgraded GGP and ASN from a 1- Strong Buy to a 2-Buy.
q We upgraded EQR and KIM from a 2- Buy to a 1- Strong Buy and SPG and CLI
from a 3-Mkt. Pfm. to a 2-
Buy.
q Our rating changes reflect both our more defensive posture where solidity
of cash flow will be paramount in
the minds of investors and changes in market prices that have taken place
over the past 3 weeks.

Adept Technology 		David Shulman
Revising Down Our Rating To 2-Buy / 123 (USD)
q We are downgrading SL Green to a 2-Buy from a 1-Strong Buy. Our target
remains $33. We are
maintaining our '01 FFO/sh. est. of $3.00 and revising our '02 est. to $3.22
from $3.28 for assumed
lower inv't income.
q Downgrade is largely based on valuation. SLG is up 43% since 2/00 and
12.5% YTD. Tightness of NYC
mrkt priced in.
q While SLG should benefit in next few months from displaced downtown
tenants & tighter vacancies, impact
of national recession on major NYC industries will eventually dominate.
q We are revising down our '02 FFO/sh. est to $3.22 from $3.28 largely for
lower assumptions for SLG's HY
inv't income.
q SLG remains a dominant player in NYC market. Significant embedded growth
should keep driving
earnings. Investing $700m. of acq. capacity will be a key test.

Archstone Communities Tr 		David Shulman
Revising Down Our Rating To 2-Buy 2 - Buy / 25.39 (USD)
q We are lowering our rating to 2-Buy from 1-Strong Buy. We are reducing our
FFO/sh. ests. for '02
by $0.13 to $2.33. We are reducing our price target to $28.
q As an owner/operator of a national portfolio of apartments we believe ASN
represents a safe investment
offering a 6.3% dividend yield and fairly certain earnings growth. The
proposed merger with Charles E.
Smith (SRW $50.90, 2-Buy) will add integration risks and predominantly
high-rise, urban assets which
could be less certain performers.
q ASN's weighting towards development and technology/capital market
orientated locations may be sources
of future weakness than strength.

Equity Residential Pptys Tr		 David Shulman
Revising Up Our Rating To 1 Strong Buy 1 - Strong Buy / 58.00 (USD)
q We are raising our rating to 1 Strong Buy from 2 Buy. We our lowering our
FFO/sh. ests for '01 by
$0.05 to $5.29 and for '02 by $0.15 to $5.57. We are increasing our price
target to $64.
q As an owner/operator of a national portfolio of predominantly Class B
apartments, EQR represents what
we believe is a safe investment offering a 5.9% dividend yield and fairly
certain earnings growth prospects.
The company's strong operating performance record and solid balance sheet
are supportive features.
q We believe that EQR is a potential candidate for inclusion in the S&P
Index which should boost share
recognition/liquidity.
q There is to be a 2 for 1 share split next week.

General Growth Properties 		David Shulman
Downgrading to a 2-Buy 2 - Buy / 35.05 (USD)
q We are downgrading GGP to a 2-Buy from a 1-Strong Buy. We are reducing our
target price to $38
from $42. We are lowering our '01 & '02 FFO/sh. est. to $4.90 and $5.25 from
$4.95 and $5.40.
q GGP fundamentals softening amid weaker sales, temp. tenant income,
percentage rent and anticipated
specialty store closings. We assume 200 bps of occupancy losses and 100 bps
slower revenue growth in
'02. Ala Moana sensitive to tourism falloff.
q Mix of fixed-floating amounts on $1.1bil. YE CMBS refinancing will impact
'02 numbers (fixed
$6.5%,floating 4.5%).
q GGP remains a dominant national regional mall REIT with solid operating,
development, and acq. track
record. Recent 22% dividend increase should attract yield players.

Kimco Realty 		David Shulman
Upgrading to a 1-Strong Buy 1 - Strong Buy / 48.19 (USD)
q We are upgrading KIM to a 1-Stong Buy from a 2-Buy. We are raising our
price target to $54 from
$48. We are maintaining our '01 '02 FFO/sh. est. of $4.48 and revising our
'02 est. to $4.85 from
$4.88.
q KIM is an attractive defensive play as nation's largest grocery and
neighborhood center REIT, with solid
credit rating and leading track record in opportunistic transactions with
troubled retailers.
q Income REIT should benefit from increased spreads, buying at 9-10% and
financing at 7%. In '02, KIM's
acq. volume should benefit from more sellers than buyers.

Mack-Cali Realty 		David Shulman
Upgrading to a 2-Buy 2 - Buy / 30.85 (USD)
q We are upgrading CLI to a 2-Buy from a 3-Mrk't Perform. We are raising our
price target to $34 from
$30. We are raising our '01 and '02 FFO/sh. est. to $3.67 and $3.96 from
$3.65 and $3.89.
q We believe CLI is poised to benefit from scramble for suburban NYC space
from displaced downtown
tenants. Flight to suburbs may prove a long-term secular shift.
q Plaza 5 at Harborside, CLI's 900,000 sf dvl'p in 2H02 now well timed &
should open 80%+ occupied. We
also assume same store rev. and occ. pickup of 100 bps, 10.5% of port. rolls
in '02.
q Asset dispositions ahead of schedule. Sale of $200m. Denver port. by YE
coupled with recent DC sale
should accelerate buyback.

Simon Property Group	 David Shulman
Upgrading to a 2-Buy 3 - Market Perform / 27.13 (USD)
q We are upgrading SPG to a 2-Buy from a 3-Mrk't Perform. We are maintaining
our price target of
$30. We are lowering our '01 and '02 FFO/sh. est. to $3.51 and $3.65 from
$3.55 and $3.75.
q Rationale for upgrade- SPG poised to weather economic storm as a result of
national diversification,
limited development program, strong balance sheet, 8% divided yield &
possible S&P 500 inclusion.
q Mall fundamentals softening amid weaker sales, temp. tenant income,
percentage rent & anticipated
specialty store closings. We assume 200 bps of occupancy losses and 100 bps
slower revenue growth in
'02. Merchantwired breakeven gets pushed out even further.

AMB Property Corp 		David Shulman
Downgrading to a 2-Buy 2 - Buy / 24.34 (USD)
q We are downgrading AMB to a 2-Buy from a 1-Strong Buy. We are lowering our
price target to $26
from $28. We are lowering our '01 and '02 FFO/sh. est. to $2.49 and $2.58
from $2.51 and $2.72.
q Our new '02 est. reflects expected occupancy loss of 200 bps & lower same
store revenues of 100 bps.
Leaseup of dvlp pipeline should lower yields about 100 bps to 10.5%. San
Francisco still 20% of NOI,
Moffit Field port. subject to tenant losses.
q Rent growth of HTD assets will likely slow significantly given lower
passenger and air cargo volumes.
q Industrial sector has still not priced in recession-exposure from shorter
lease duration and tenant
bankruptcies. Outsourcing model to be tested.

Avalon Bay Communities		 David Shulman
Lowering Our FFO/sh. Ests. 1 - Strong Buy / 47.30 (USD)
q We are reducing our FFO/sh. est. for '02 by $0.18 to $4.22. We reiterate
our rating of 1-Strong Buy
and our price target of $52.
q This owner/operator of a national portfolio of Class A apartments should
be a safe investment offering the
prospect of positive earnings growth and a dividend yield of 5.4%, likely to
be increased by 10%.
q AVB's weighting towards development and technology/capital market
orientated locations may be sources
of future weakness rather than strength.
q AVB has one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector affording
flexibility and the boost to earnings
from the swapping of high coupon pref. shares with lower cost debt.
Boston Properties David Shulman
Downgrading to a 2-Buy 2 - Buy / 37.70 (USD)
q We are downgrading BXP to a 2-Buy from a 1-Strong Buy. We are lowering our
price target to $42
from $48. We are lowering our '01 and '02 FFO/sh. est. to $3.57 and $4.05
from $3.59 and $4.15.
q Our new numbers reflect expected '02 occupancy loss of 200 bps & lower
same store revenues of 50 bps.
Only 5.6% of port. rolls in '02. Development returns remain in place as we
already stripped out Broad Run
& 611 Gateway.
q Value of high profile CBD office properties (Embarcaderro, Pru. Center)
has been impaired in wake of 9/11
attack. Time Square II leaseup a plus.
q Embedded option value of BXP's development capability worth less in
recessionary environment. San
Francisco has yet to find a bottom, while sub. Boston and Northern VA should
remain challenging.

CenterPoint Properties		 David Shulman
Reducing Our Rating To 3-Market Perform 3 - Market Perform / 46.90 (USD)
q We are reducing our rating to 3-Market Perform from 2-Buy. We are lowering
our FFO/sh. ests. for
'01 by $0.05 to $3.75 and for '02 by $0.20 to $4.05. We are reducing our
price target to $49.
q We believe that industrial property markets could prove to be vulnerable
to weakness in an economic
recession lasting 2-3 qtrs. with bankruptcies and reduced rents.
q Notwithstanding CNT's undoubted positives of management depth and market
focus, we believe future
earnings could be at risk from a weak industrial market, the HALO vacancy
($0.35/sh. pa) and a slowing of
progress at Joliet (17m sf) and other developments.
q We believe investors may question the magnitude of CNT's premium rating in
a prolonged recessionary
environment.

Equity Office Properties		David Shulman
Lowering Our FFO/sh. Ests/Pr. Target 1 - Strong Buy / 32.45 (USD)
q We are lowering our FFO/sh. ests. for '01 by $0.02 to $3.17 and for '02 by
$0.20 to $3.32. We are
lowering our price target to $35. We reiterate our rating of 1-Strong Buy.
q The present economic downturn will highlight the benefits of owning
quality office properties let to credit
tenants on long leases. EOP should be capable of delivering earnings growth
and have the ability to
increase its dividend.
q The potential inclusion of EOP into the S&P 500 Index will enhance share
recognition/liquidity.
q Achieving our price target together with receipt of a 6.2% dividend yield
would provide an attractive total
return of 14%.

Portfolio Strategy 		Jeffrey Applegate
Further Denting the New Paradigm
q We have once again reduced our S&P 500 EPS forecast from $46.50 to $45 for
2001 and from $53 to
$51 for 2002.
q During the second half of the 1990s, we had been one of the strongest
proponents of the New Paradigm.
q Our core contention was that the combination of globalization, a good U.S.
public policy mix, and a robust
capital for labor substitution process would boost productivity, improve
profitability and make for richer
stock market valuation.
q Since September 11, globalization and productivity have been dented, as
national income and to some
extent, global, is redirected to security-enhancing measures and away from
productivity.
q So we have once again reduced our S&P 500 EPS forecast from $46.50 to $45
for this year and from $53
to $51 for 2002.
q Since we already reduced valuation last week by adopting a higher
equity-risk premium, our forward one-year
S&P 500 price target is unchanged at 1200.

Allegheny Energy 		Daniel Ford
2001: A Tough Year to Improve On 2 - Buy / 37.60 (USD)
q We are lowering our 2002 EPS outlook $0.12/share to $4.03 which reflects
current forward power
assumptions. We maintain our 2-Buy rating and our target is $42 which
reflects a group average
10.6x multiple of our 2002E.
q AYE is on track to hit our $3.80 2001E, a 34% uptick from 2000. However,
weaker power prices and
business conditions make for a tougher outlook.
q The biggest 2002 positive is the Global Energy Markets acquisition which
should add $0.21/share. Our
$4.50 2003E is driven by new development activities and a full year of the
Nevada tolling arrangement.
q Weaker power prices are the biggest negative and drop the 1,710 MW Enron
acquisition to around
breakeven in 2002 from $0.25/share plus in 2001.

Allstate Corp 		J. Paul Newsome
Mmgt Meetings Lead Us to Affirm Rating 1 - Strong Buy / 36.15 (USD)
q We are reiterating our 1-Strong Buy recommendation on Allstate following
meetings with
management in Chicago.
q We are more confident than before that Allstate is taking aggressive
efforts to fix its homeowners
insurance business. The majority of Allstate's second quarter earnings
shortfall and the resulting
downward earnings forecast revisions can be attributed to Allstate's
decision to take a less aggressive
stance in the recent months towards seeking rate increases for expected
catastrophe losses.

Ericsson		 Timothy Luke
Highlights from Meeting-Cautious Outlook 3 - Market Perform / 3.41 (USD)
q On Friday, our wireless team met w/Ericsson mgmt incl. CFO Sten Fornell.
In general, tone of mtg
was somewhat downbeat based on broader challenges in macro economic env.
Maintain current
low end ests & 3 Mkt Perform.
q In general, conditions in wireless infra. remain challenging. Mgmt noted
that recent events in U.S. have
added further uncertainty to an already fragile env. Visibility on order
patterns remains ltd.
q Overall global spending likely to remain sluggish in 02. Mgmt noted
spending in China could be flat to
down. We believe spending could be -10% YoY.
q W/lower spending, continued R&D investmts in W-CDMA & broader ind
overcapacity at factories, infra
margins could remain under pressure.

Gaming & Lodging		 Joyce Minor
No Surprise, Preannouncements Abound
q Yesterday, MGG & STN pre-announced, indicating that 3Q01 results would be
lower than expected.
This is not surprising given the impact of the 9/11/01 terrorist attacks,
which most impacted LV.
Like peers MBG & HET who both issued releases last week indicating that 3Q01
results would be
weaker, MGG & STN did not specify the earnings impact. As LV rebounds and
barring any
significant impact from U.S. retaliation, gaming stocks continue to look
attractive in our view. At
this point, HET's diversification and PENN are still among our favorites.
q We are developing a sensitivity analysis and will re-evaluate our
estimates for 3Q01 and beyond for our
gaming universe shortly, following our thoughts from the Global Gaming Expo
Monday through
Wednesday.
q IGT also issued a press release this morning, indicating that trends have
improved since 9/11/01, and that
IGT is comfortable with FY2001E EPS consensus of $2.79, $0.01 below our
$2.80 EPS estimate.
However, the impact on product sales (36% of EBITDA) will not be clear until
4-6 weeks after the Global
Gaming Expo, when orders are placed. We expect the cancellation and
constraint in gaming operators'
capital expenditure budgets to impact IGT's forward product sales although
the 2.5 million shares
repurchased since 9/11/01 should offset FY2002E results somewhat.

Gaming & Lodging		 Joyce Minor
Aug RevPAR-4.6%, Means Less after 9/11
q ? On Friday, Smith Travel Research released August lodging industry data
indicating that industry-wide
RevPAR declined -4.6% for the month. An improvement from the -6.0% RevPAR
decline of
July, August results are less meaningful given the recent terrorist attacks
that took place on 9/11.
q Industry-wide supply growth fell again in August to 2.3%, vs. the 2.9%
supply growth reported during 12/00
through 04/01. Given the impact of the 9/11 attacks on the lodging industry,
we would expect supply
growth trends to fall even lower than the 2% or so we had originally
anticipated during the next year. As
demand gradually returns (and it will be gradual), this slowing supply
growth trend continues to be a longer
term positive for the lodging industry.
q The upper upscale segment reported a RevPAR decline of -10.6% during
August. Given this and the
average -48% RevPAR declines during the two weeks following the attacks
means we would expect most
of the lodging companies we follow to report 3Q01 RevPAR declines of -20% or
so.

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production	 Thomas R. Driscoll
Revising 2H'01 EPS/CFPS Estimates
q We are revising our EPS/CFPS est for 3Q & 4Q'01 to incorporate actual oil
& gas prices for Q3 & to
reflect a further revision in our oil & gas price estimates for Q4'01. The
combined impact of these
changes is a reduction of approximately 3-6% in our full year 2001 EPS/CFPS
estimates.

Oil & Gas: Exploration & Production 	Thomas R. Driscoll
Est. injection of 80 bcf for week 9/29
q We estimate that this week's storage report - to be announced this
Wednesday at 2pm - will be an
injection of about 80 bcf (10 bcf higher than our previous estimate of 70
bcf) compared to an
injection of 78 bcf a year ago.

Specialty Pharmaceuticals	 Richard Silver
Potential Upside for WPI & MYL on BuSpar
q Watson & Mylan Labs may be significant near-term beneficiaries from a
continued delay in generic
competition for BuSpar. We estimate at least an incremental $0.10 potential
quarterly EPS impact
for each company beginning in the December quarter. However, we see little
impact for Bristol and
for the multiple generic competitors awaiting approval from the FDA.
q Last week was to have marked the expiration of a 180-day market
exclusivity period for generic versions of
Bristol Myers Squibb's BuSpar. However, we have learned that through actions
taken by Bristol (that were
completely overlooked by generic companies until now), additional generic
competition may be delayed
indefinitely, while the FDA internally debates the issue and seeks to avoid
litigation from Bristol and
generics.

Wal-Mart Stores		 Jeffrey Feiner
Comments Ahead of Webcast; 1 Strong Buy 1 - Strong Buy / 47.00 (USD)
q WMT will be hosting its annual analyst update on 10/2 via webcast. We
believe this update, which
is being held in lieu of its traditional 2 day event in Arkansas, will be a
catalyst for the shares.
q We are reiterating our 1 rating on WMT to reflect 7 key potential
catalysts: 1) its ability to finance price
rollbacks to accelerate market share gains; 2) aggressive expansion of its
food business through the
Supercenter format - with over 1,000 units; 3) the full-scale rollout of its
Neighborhood Market concept -which
is now profitable; 4) continued improvement in its international division;
5) the successful extension
of the Wal-Mart brand into financial services and other products; 6) a
stronger and deeper management
team; and 7) a favorable valuation.

Walgreen Co 		Meredith Adler
Well positioned to weather weak economy 2 - Buy / xx (USD)
q We see no deterioration in WAG's competitive position within the industry,
but we believe the
weaker economy will pressure gross margins for at least the first half of
the year. With WAG
trading at a calendarized 31.8x our new 2002 estimate, we believe this is a
good entry point for
investors looking for a strong company with superior management and
technology, and growing
market share in a stable industry. We are maintaining our 2-Buy rating and
our $40 Price target.
q We are initiating our 1Q02 EPS estimate of $0.18. We are also lowering our
FY02 estimate by $0.02, to
$1.00, given our outlook for a lower-margin front-end sales mix that does
not offset the steady, secular
pressure on margins from strong growth in pharmacy.

Wolverine World Wide	 Robert Drbul
Positioned Well in Uncertain Time 1 - Strong Buy / 14.50 (USD)
q Wolverine reported 3Q01 diluted EPS of $0.34 compared with diluted EPS of
$0.28 in 3Q00, $0.02
better than our estimate.
q Sales growth for the Merrell brand exceeded the company's planned 35%
growth rate in the quarter as
new product introductions for fall are performing well at retail.
q Gross margin increased by 297 basis points to 36.42% reflecting benefits
of the sourcing realignment,
higher initial pricing margins as well as increased sales of higher margin
lifestyle product.
q Given that re-order business is highest in 4Q (approximately 50% of
revenue), we believe this segment will
come under pressure given the difficult retail climate and continued
conservative planning by retailers.

"Votenet Brings NAFSA's National Elections Online","
For Immediate Release  Friday, October 12, 2001 	Media Contact: Michael Mack Vice President of Business Development Phone: (202) 207-0540 michael.mack@votenet.com 	


Votenet Brings NAFSA's National Elections Online 

Firm formally launches eBallot software and consulting practice for associations and member-based organizations 

October 26, 2001, Washington, D.C. - Votenet Solutions, Inc. is pleased to announce its latest web-based software innovation, eBallot, which allows organization's members to vote online.  This easy-to-use, cost effective method of voting will change forever how private elections are conducted.  NAFSA (Association for International Educators http://www.nafsa.org) employed Votenet's technology as the sole voting mechanism during their recent 2002 national officer's election.  With 35 candidates running in twenty races internationally, NAFSA members were able to vote online for the first time in NAFSA's history.    
""As an international association with a dispersed membership, the benefits of Votenet's application are incalculable,"" says Denise Wold, Director of Membership Services, NAFSA, an organization of 6400 members. ""The key to our success was the ease-of-use of the voting system.  Our members found the voting application to be intuitive and convenient.  Taking our election online allowed our members to view candidate profiles and vote in just a few minutes.""  
Votenet's eBallot software provides: 
Convenient 24 hour a day online ballots integrated into the organization's website; 
Candidate biographies;  
Election management suite that enables election administrators to monitor voting and view real-time voting reports; 
Login security ensures one vote per eligible voter; 
Web-based application is scalable to handle any size election or referendum. 

Ideal for any organization with elected officials, Votenet's eBallot Software is not only secure, but it is easy-to-use and will aid in cutting mailing, labor, and other overhead costs involved with elections.  ""Votenet's online election system saved time and money and will certainly benefit us in future election years,"" remarked Bill Newman, Chief Financial Officer at NAFSA.  ""Any association or organization interested in slashing the financial and man-power costs associated with an election should consider working with Votenet to conduct a virtual election."" 
""A large number of elections take place every year at national and international associations, businesses, charities, and unions.  Now to be able to perform that function, while also offering candidate biographies, a 'voting wizard' to aid voters, and real-time results, online is impressive. The time, trouble and cost associated with a traditional paper intensive election system makes Votenet's eBallot Software a very high ROI application for any organization with a large or geographically dispersed voting constituency,"" says Glen Hughlette, CEO and President of Votenet Solutions. 
The eBallot software is immediately available from Votenet Solutions.  Interested groups can learn how to license the software by calling a sales representative at 1-800-VOTENET ext. 513

Price differentials aren't always about time and location-- sometimes they are about the likelihood of being paid. Utilities have traditionally finessed credit requirements by spreading uncollectables among their customer base, and until recently, this was enough to make the utilities themselves bulletproof credit risks.

"Digital Storm - deadline May 18th.","
Hi  Jeff,
 
I am following up on  a confidential manuscript I sent you a few days ago of ""Digital Storm  - Fresh business strategies from the Electronic Marketplace"".  Is is a book about B2B E-Commerce and E-Markets after the hype. It will be  distributed by Wiley this summer as an A+ title (lead category) and Hasso  Plattner, CEO of SAP wrote the preface.
 
Enron is  featured as the most successful marketplace to date with a bright  future.
 
I was wondering,  whether you would like to include a testimonial for the book.  It would certainly also be good marketing for Enron's entry into new  marketplaces. For your convenience I include a potential  quote:
 
Running  the world's largest electronic marketplace, we embrace the opportunities and  challenges of B2B E-Commerce. In 'Digital Storm' Philipp Gerbert and his  colleagues give a powerful analysis of what has been learnt and invaluable  insights for future strategies in this area. 
(you can of course  write what you want; more ideas are in the attachment, which also contains  additional information).
 
I apologize that  this is a bit urgent - the deadline is Friday this week  May 18th). 
 
I very much hope  that you enjoy the manuscript. Perhaps you would be interested to further  discuss the ideas. 
 
Best regards, Phil  Gerbert
 
PS: Due to the  urgency I used your e-mail from our McKinsey alumni directory.  PhG

"Management Changes","I regret to inform you that Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon have decided to leave Enron to pursue other opportunities.  Most recently, Ken had been assisting in the transition of Enron Broadband Services to Wholesale Services.  Kevin recently left Broadband Services to lead our Global Assets business.

In addition to building a wholesale model for the trading of bandwidth as a commodity, Ken and Kevin made significant contributions to the development of our wholesale business.  I am grateful to both of them for their outstanding service to Enron.

I am pleased to announce that effective immediately Stan Horton, chairman and CEO of Enron Transportation Services, will assume additional leadership responsibility as chairman and CEO of Enron Global Assets, excluding the South American merchant business, which will continue to report to John Lavorato.  Stan is a 28-year veteran of the company with a proven track record of outstanding results.  Enron Global Assets will continue to function as a separate unit headed by President and Chief Operating Officer Jim Hughes, who will report to Stan.

Please join me in supporting Stan in his expanded role and in wishing Ken and Kevin the very best of success in their new endeavors.

		[IMAGE]  	
[IMAGE] 	 [IMAGE]     Dear Jeffrey Skilling,    Calyx and Corolla's new fall selection of floral, plant and preserved arrangements is quite possibly the most excitingly beautiful collection in the world.  What we love most is each arrangement quietly conveys heartfelt thoughts and emotions in an exquisite manner allowing us to truly treasure the times we have with our dear family and friends.  A true expression of beauty and purity can  be found in our Golden Lily Plant  (shown right). Its coloring makes this lily  - a new  hybrid developed just last year - a natural for the fall season.  Our Vineyard  Bouquet  reflects the relaxed, unpretentious hospitality of  countryside living. Sunflowers, viking pompom mums, and lacy solidago  are casually presented in a big, rustic brass urn with an antiqued  rust finish.   Our exclusive Pumpkin  Patch Basket  symbolizes nature's harvest and the inspiration  of a new season unfolding.   We're enchanted with the wonderfully vibrant bouquets our travels  have discovered, including  our infamous Blue  Ribbon Gerbera Daisies  and the bold yet beautiful Jungle  Mum Bouquet .  Each illuminates distinction and pays tribute to a special occasion.  Please view our Sale   and Specials   pages for limited-time offers.  Calyx  & Corolla  	[IMAGE]

"The Morning Market Call - Tuesday June 5th, 2001."," <<MF June 5th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

Abbreviated Letter Today.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.65%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.28%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.84%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.09 p/b.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

J.C. Penney(JCP) 1 - Strong Buy J. Feiner, .212.526.2322
Raising Rating, Price Target and EPS Estimates
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $20.68 EPS 2000 N/A -$0.44 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $23 - 9 EPS 2001 $0.30E $0.35E $0.29E 59.1
Mkt Cap: $5.7B EPS 2002 $0.65E $0.75E $0.72E 27.6
FY: 1/31 Price Target N/A $33
Rank 2 1
*Eckerd Alone is Worth More than Current Price. We are raising our
investment rating on JC Penney to 1 - Strong Buy
from 2 - Buy and setting a 12-month price target of $33 per share. Our
upgrade is based on two key factors: 1) an EBITDA valuation
for Eckerd that indicates that JCPs drug store business is worth more than
its current overall stock price, and 2) an improving
competitive position for department stores over the longer term.
*We are increasing 2001 and 2002 EPS estimates to reflect expected
improvements from CEO Allen Questroms strategy to restore
operating profit at both drug and dept. stores. Goals are to grow drug and
department store EBIT to 4.5% and 6.0% of sales over the
next 3-5 years, respectively, through merchandising and expense initiatives.
Our estimates are $0.35 for 2001 and $0.75 for 2002.
*We believe management has correctly identified Eckerd as the catalyst with
the strongest near-term potential to impact profit. Our
12-month price target of $33 incorporates a valuation of $25 for Eckerd and
a conservative $8 for the department stores.

Mkt Cap: $12.9B EPS 2002 N/A N/A $1.75E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $70 $70
Rank 2 2
*Based on mixed feedback from mid-quarter channel checks and continued
competitive concerns, we encourage investors to remain
on the sidelines despite recent weakness in the stock.
*Channel checks conducted over the past 3 days suggest a modestly improving
environment. Strength in education and government
verticals being offset by weakness in financial services.
*VPN market remains fiercely competitive with Cisco, Nortel, Netscreen and
others establishing larger presence, especially in the fast
growing site-to-site VPN market. Greater competition likely to cap upside
potential over near-term as economy slows.
*Issue of premium pricing being raised as customers look at alternative
offerings in order to extract savings from their IT budgets.
While not the differentiating factor, price is becoming more relevant to
purchasing decision as competitive offerings improve.

Comverse Technology(CMVT) 1 - Strong Buy T. Luke, .212.526.4993
Yet Another Impressive Quarter; Reit 1 Strong Buy (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $59.59 EPS 2000 N/A $1.47 N/A N/A

FY: 1/31 Price Target $85 $85
Rank 1 1
*Last night, wireless messaging and enhanced services leader Comverse
delivered yet another impressive quarter. We reiterate our 1
Strong Buy rating.
*Revenues of $365M beat our $356M est, as a solid performance from the CNS
unit offset an expected decline in the InfoSys unit.
Sales of new applications are now more than 20% of CNS.
*EPS of $0.43 beat our $0.42 est with gross margins remaining at a record
level of 62.6%.
*Mgmt raised 2Q guidance to $370M from $365M, although 'mindful' of the
macro environment. The key backlog metric increased
again to $325M from $320M.
*We believe investors may be encouraged by the uptick in backlog, growth in
new data apps, the rise in guidance, and mgmt's more
optimistic view of 2.5G timing. Our 2001 ests move to $1.79 from $1.78. We
believe investors may pay a premium for consistency.
Target - $85 (40x '02 est of $2.12).

Xilinx, Inc(XLNX) 3 - Market Perform D. Niles, .415.274.5252
No change to revs but GMs lowered (C)
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $41.59 EPS 2001 N/A $1.14 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $98 - 30 EPS 2002 $0.76E $0.76E $0.72E 54.7
Mkt Cap: $14.6B EPS 2003 $1.11E $1.11E $1.02E 37.5
FY: 3/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*Xilinx had no change to revs guidance of minus 15-25% q/q though they are
tracking to the lower end because we believe they felt
most investors understood that already. Regardless, this will be viewed as a
positive. The real key will be June given almost 40% of
the revs still need to be done. Junes momentum will also drive the guidance
for CQ3.
*Their newer Virtex-E product line (near 30% of revs) is doing better than
expected but due to the poorer gross margins GMs will be
surprisingly at the lower end of the prior 58-60% range. The margins
guidance was given because most investors were not focused
on this like the revs. More aggressive cost controls is expected to keep EPS
unchanged.
*As we noted in our preview, cancellations and pushouts have slowed with
turns better in May but this follows the end of April/early
May which was poor. With investors expecting CQ3 q/q rev growth, this will
be the key. With the BtB still below 1.0, this will be a
tough goal to achieve.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES
Kellogg Co(K) 3 - Market Perform A. Lazar, .212.526.4668
KBL Management Positive on Integration. Maintain Rating.
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $26.58 EPS 2000 N/A $1.55 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $31 - 22 EPS 2001 $1.25E $1.25E $1.24E 21.3
Mkt Cap: $10.8B EPS 2002 $1.35E $1.35E $1.36E 19.7
FY: 12/31 Price Target $26 $26
Rank 3 3
*We recently met with Keebler senior management to assess integration into
Kellogg -- a near term risk and overhang on the shares.
We came away more comfortable with the process.
*First, management appeared more confident with DSD transition, noting it
would already know of any big glitches at this time.
*Second, retail inventory draw down process of Kellogg convenience items is
essentially done (ahead of schedule) with levels having
been reduced from 5 to 2 weeks.
*Third, 100 new DSD sales reps have been hired and should ramp up quickly
given 100% commission structure. We believe other
industry transactions have aided the hiring process.
*Biscuit category remains rational as competitors also occupied with
integration. Accordingly, category growth may slow. Impact of
integration on core Keebler business remains largest risk. Plus, shares
trade at only modest discount to peers.

Autos & Auto Parts N. Lobaccaro, .212.526.2842
Ford Overtakes GM for Highest Inventory ""honors""
*Due to GM's unexpected (and incentive-driven) sales increase in May, Ford
has captured the dubious honor of having the highest
inventory levels in the industry, a position GM has defended for years.
*While inventory levels at this time of year average roughly 63 days, Ford's
stand at 68 days, with cars well below normal levels, but
trucks well above normal levels at 78 days.
*GM inventories came in at 62 days overall, well below its 6-month average
of 89 days. While inventory levels would have been
expected to decline in May due to the seasonal increase in the unit sales
pace, the decline was greater than anticipated due to GM's
higher than expected sales, which may not be sustainable.

"Catching Up","Jeff -- I don't know exactly what you are up to now that you have left
Enron, but if you could help me deal with a situation, I would be most
appreciative.  I am Chairman of Seurat Company (www.seurat.com), a firm
specializing in helping organizations harness the inherent value in
relationships with high-value entities;  e.g., customers, employees,
partners, suppliers, and investors.  While remaining totally agnostic as to
vendor selection, we work with firms like Siebel Systems to build the
business case for implementing CRM and ERM (Employee Relationship
Management).  It is my understanding that before you left Enron you
established an initiative to consolidate over 650 portals into a common
platform.  Siebel has been effectively shut out of the discussions currently
underway.  Is there a way that you could at least open the right doors so
they can make their pitch?  Siebel has a platform that combines a global
portal with an ERM underpinning, one that is well worth looking into.

Let me know what, if anything, you can do to assist in this endeavor.  In
the meantime, I hope all is well.  A lunch or dinner in Boston or wherever
would be a great way to catch up.

kai -.

Brother Dent, as another Brother Dent, you may not remember but we finally
met a few years ago at the A@M Student Center when you were having a book
signing before the A@M/ Baylor game and I got you to sign a copy of ""The
Junction Boys"" for my stepson , Jim Bavouset, who was an Aggie Beta.  We had
a nice long chat remembering some of the times from back in the 70's when
you were the Sports Editor for the Daily Campus and I was working my ass off
over in the corner of the campus in law school.  You gave me a business
card, and I've been remiss in not contacting you since that serindipitous
occasion when I finallly met you.  I hope that you'll acept this - my
apology for not contacting you before now.  I've actually thought about it
several times before now.

So,  after reading all of these posts from all of you guys from classes just
after mine (and it hurts me that more of my own classmates and guys before
me haven't found it appropriate to write on this Board), I'm quite impressed
to see how close all of you guys have remained after all of these years -
just like I was to see all of my good friends and Brothers from the class of
'71 this past weekend.  I saw a few guys I haven't seen in over 25+ years -
and we picked up as if there hadn't been any time that elapsed between.
Damn, it's great to be a BETA!

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Last year the  class of 75 held the only DORG recorded in University Park history; initiated  the firstest and onlyest EWogolin.com; manned a Beta tent with more people  than the class of 74, 75 & 76 combined; were banned from O'jedas for 1  year for just being us and still had room for cocktails at the Mules house on  Sunday morning.

"Summer Internship","Dear Mr. Skilling,

	My name is Chris Weekley and I am David and Bonnie Weekley's son.   I am
writing because I am in search of a summer internship (paid or non-paid).  I
recently had out of town plans fall through and this is why I am beginning
this process seemingly late.  I am a junior at Vanderbilt University and I am
majoring in Human and Organization Development with a focus on Leadership
Effectiveness.  This major studies organizations and the human interactions
that allow them to effectively operate.  I have taken various courses in
organizational theory, economics and human relations.   I think it would be a
great opportunity for me to gain experience within Enron.  I would be more
than happy with any type of job from research to customer relations.  For the
first three weeks of summer I will be a counselor at a Christian sports camp
leaving me available from June 11th until August 8th.  I am trying to tie
something down in the next few days prior to my departure for camp if at all
possible.  Thank you so much for your time and consideration.

"Wishing You Well!","Jeff,
Now that the dust has started to settled (only slightly), I just want to
write this note to wish you well.
There are times when looking out for #1 is of paramount importance.
While we are not in touch with one another to any great extent, I do
empathize with you on the strains that you must have encountered over the
last few years! Actually, I probably have no conception of the strain and
pressure!  Nonetheless, I hope we can remain in touch. To the extent that
can help in any way (and I don't mean to be presumptuous), I would be
delighted to do so.
Best regards,

David.

"Africa","Jeff:
My name is Tom Mashington and I'm a Construction Project Manager for EES in their Philadelphia office. A few weeks ago, I received in the mail a Enron newsletter which contained a feature of you and your interests. While reading the article, I noticed that you're into ""Anything Africa."" Two years ago, I was working in Ghana, West Africa on a cogen plant with Stone & Webster. Most US. citizens have no idea what the conditions are like in these 3rd world countries. 
I was curious as to how many trips you've made to the sub-Saharan section of the continent and to which countries you have visited.
Earlier, I was discussing my African experience with Marty Sunde. I sent him a few ebony wood carvings purchased from the local villagers. These pieces were hand carved by artisans in the area.  If you have a moment, you should stop by his office on the 8th floor where he has them on display.
I have also attached the files containing a few digital photo's from the area where I lived and worked. These are primarily photos from the local villages near the plant.
While you're viewing the photos, you should be able to recognize me. I'm the only American looking individual in the tribe.
Enjoy

Tom Mashington

"KUDLOW'S TAKE -- National Review Online - September 11, 2001","
DUE TO THE RECENT TRAGEDY AND DAMAGE IN NEW  YORK WE ARE EXPERIENCING SOME LOCAL INTERNET CONNECTION PROBLEMS. WE APOLOGIZE  FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE THIS MAY CAUSE.
 
KUDLOW'S TAKE 
By Lawrence Kudlow 
 
THE PRICE WE MUST PAY 
We are at war.  And  war changes everything. 
 
After today's heinous crimes committed by  terrorists against the U.S. and the 
rest of civilized humanity, there must  be a sea change in American policies 
if we are to effectively play the rough  hand that God has dealt us. 
 
We are at war. And war changes everything,  including policies. We must now 
embrace war policies. 
 
Among the carnage and massive human suffering there  is an important wake-up 
call that must be heeded by Democrats and  Republicans alike: We live in a 
dangerous world, and we must never forget  how utterly important it is to 
maintain our defenses in order to preserve  freedom and democracy and our way 
of life. 
 
The terrorist invasion of the U.S. mainland  underscores the urgent need to 
rebuild the defense and national security  structure that has slowly but 
steadily eroded in recent years. Barbaric  terrorists have revealed 
significant flaws in our intelligence systems and  in our security 
arrangements at home. This will all have to be changed. The  threat of 
terrorist use of nuclear or other weapons of massive destruction  hammers home 
the urgent need for strategic defense measures and a general  technological 
rebuilding of our defense posture. 
 
In financial terms, this will cost hundreds of  billions of dollars. So be it. 
It's a drop in the bucket for the defense of  freedom. We will sell bonds to 
finance military security. Bonds will finance  investment in freedom. 
 
In economic policy terms, today's terrorist  invasion similarly changes 
everything. To backstop national security  recovery we must take aggressive 
actions to stimulate economic recovery. It  was Reagan who argued 20 years ago 
that U.S. economic decline in the 1970s  stimulated Soviet adventurism and 
expansionism. Reagan knew that economic  recovery at home would insure 
international recovery abroad. 
 
In an interesting book by Professor Gary Dean Best,  entitled Pride, 
Prejudice, and Politics, a similar point was made about the  linkage between 
domestic economic policy and international security policy.  Prof. Best noted 
that the failure of the U.S. to recover from the Depression  - where even as 
late as 1940 the unemployment rate was 14.6% - created an  image that the 
economically-plagued U.S. would be a weak player on the world  political 
scene. Quite simply, Best argued that economic weakness at home  encouraged 
Hitler and Japan abroad. 
 
In today's terms, one cannot help but wonder  whether Mideast-based terrorist 
groups do not think that their  energy-producing state government sponsors can 
simply turn the dial, tighten  oil production, and thereby weaken the American 
economy even more. Is it  entirely a coincidence that the terrorist actions 
aimed at closing down Wall  Street, closing down the Pentagon, and even 
closing down the U.S.  government, have occurred in the immediate aftermath of 
worsening economic  news and slumping stock market performance? 
 
No matter what the cost, the U.S. must be prepared  to restore its economy. 
Phony lockboxes must be thrown out the window.  Unnecessary obsessions over 
debt retirement must be driven away. Now is the  time for aggressive fiscal 
and monetary stimulus to promote growth and  finance freedom. Substantial tax 
cuts on individuals, businesses, capital  investment, and equipment 
depreciation should be immediately put into place.  Lower tax rates across the 
board will aid recovery by reducing production  and investment costs while 
stimulating an entrepreneurial economic return.  The Federal Reserve Board 
must substantially increase the volume of bank  reserves to reliquefy the 
financial system and the economy. Steps to promote  energy production must be 
taken aggressively. 
 
Here in New York, with the destruction of the World  Trade Center, those of us 
in the financial community will grieve over the  sad and tragic loss of 
husbands and wives who worked Downtown. So many of us  involved in politics 
and government will know people who lost their lives in  the plane hijackings. 
While we grieve sadly, our anger will demand immediate  U.S. retaliation to 
clean out the terrorist criminals and the states that  sponsor them. We know 
who they are. We know where they are. And we will hope  and pray that 
president Bush takes immediate and effective actions.  
 
But amidst the grieving and the anger, none of us  should lose sight of the 
long-term goal of preserving our freedom and  democracy. This is a national 
security goal, and it is also an economic  security goal. What happened today 
changes everything. Lord give us the  strength to learn from it and take the 
right actions to preserve it.

"[smu-betas] Dent weighs in Rocky","
Beta Brothers:

I, like many of you, enjoyed many a fatty on the Beta roof back in the
mid-1970s. But unlike Rocky Skilling, my hair did not fall out. It seems,
though, that I am few million short of the daring dynamo who now runs the
fucking world from Houston.

Many snaps for Brother Skilling. I still remember him throwing up in Arends'
shoes. But certainly, that doesn't preclude him from winning Beta's highest
honor.

I will be in Dallas the weekend of October 6 and would like to attend the
festivities if it doesn't conflict with the greatest football game on the
planet -- that, of course, being the contest down in the Cotton Bowl between
Bevo and the Mighty National Champs from Norman. You see boys, I am now a
full-blown Okie with a book to prove it. By the way, it's no longer
Texas-OU. It's now OU-Texas.

Now that we are on the subject, I am throwing an awesome bash in Norman at
the Sam Noble Museum on the evening of August 24 to unveil The Undefeated.
No, it's not about the Beta footballers of our junior season, but rather
that 47-game winning streak back in the fifties that made the Sooners world
famous. Berry, Benson, C-Di and Grumbles have confirmed. So that means we
will need bail money. Send lawyers, guns and money -- the shit has hit the
fan.

Let me know at jdent@mmcable.com or 405-858-0166.

Again, congrats to Brother Rocky, and get your butts to Oklahoma.

(By the way, Drow, you were slower than a dry creek, but you were Hutch's
favorite and that's why I never got the ball).

Brother Del Dent

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

When Enbridge (U.S.) Inc. acquired Midcoast Energy Resources, Inc. in May
2001, Midcoast had over 80 pipeline systems in 10 states, the Gulf of
Mexico and Canada, comprising over 4,100 miles of pipe, which were
transporting in excess of 1.25 bcf/d, with total revenues of $800 million
in 2000.  Midcoast had grown from $0 to $600 million in just five years in
its industry.  So why did Dan Tutcher decide it was time to stop what
Midcoast was doing and merge?

About speaker:  Dan C. Tutcher is president of Enbridge (U.S.) Inc.,
president and director of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (formerly Lakehead
Pipe Line Company), and group vice president of Transportation Group South,
wholly owned by Enbridge Inc.  Additionally, Mr. Tutcher serves as
president and CEO of Magic Interests, L.P., a Texas corporation controlled
by him.

Prior to Enbridge's acquisition of Midcoast Energy Resources, Inc.
(Midcoast) in May 2001, Mr. Tutcher founded and served as chairman of the
board, president and CEO of Midcoast from its formation in 1992.

The third generation of a petroleum industry family, Mr. Tutcher has over
30 years experience in owning and operating companies involved in petroleum
production, gas processing, natural gas gathering and transmission.  He has
been involved in the design, construction and operation of petroleum
pipelines and all types of petroleum equipment and storage, as well as oil
and gas exploration and production.  He earned a BBA from Washburn University.

Mr. Tutcher serves on the board of directors for the Interstate Natural Gas
Association of America, in addition to the Gas Processors Association and
the board of directors of Berkshire Asset Management Incorporated; he is a
past member of the Utilities Advisory Board of Cigna Corporation.  Active
within the community as well, he serves as chairman and director of Cancer
Counseling, Inc. of Houston.

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

"SAB101/Contract Mgmt. Best Practices","
Jeff, 
Contract management has become a big issue in most Fortune 1000 companies because of the risk to market capitalization that obligations in corporate contracts pose. I think that Enron executives would be very interested in the articles hot linked below. I would be glad to spend time with your organization to investigate the impact of enabling contract management best practices at Enron.
diCarta provides the first web-based contract and revenue management solution that enables businesses to negotiate, track, manage, and renew contracts via the Internet.  We have had tremendous success in helping companies like Kraft, BEA Systems, Intuit, Agile, Ernst&Young, Deloitte Consulting and many others gain visibility into their contracting and revenue management processes while  mitigating financial and legal risks.
Below is the diCarta solution overview then links to recent articles including our partnerships with Arthur Andersen and Deloitte.
diCarta's Focus:  diCarta Contracts automates your entire contract lifecycle including negotiations, execution, revenue management, maintenance, and renewals on both the sell-side and buy-side.  Your complete contract information will now be in one central location, on-line, for down-stream revenue, obligation, and renewals management.  This is enabled by a direct link of the unstructured data in the contract to structured data, which allows you to take automatic actions based on the actual contract Ts&Cs.  To maximize communication and efficiency, diCarta Contracts was specifically designed to be a collaborative application using role-based security.  E-signatures are supported as well.
Negotiation:  You can negotiate contract Ts&Cs on-line with an internal approval workflow to manage risk.  Not only will you shorten your quote-to-cash cycle, but reduce your legal and financial risk by having on-line visibility into what Ts&Cs you are approving before the contract is executed.  
Revenue Management:  On the sell-side, you will have a framework for revenue recognition per the FASB and SEC guidelines that is driven directly from the contract Ts&Cs.  Now you can manage your revenue recognition risk, significantly reduce labor, and avoid possible non-compliance.  This is extremely important as companies struggle with adherence to SAB 101.  On the buy-side, you can proactively track expenditures.
  
Renewals:  Since all contract Ts&Cs are captured, your renewal process can be completely automated.  Accurate renewal notices linked to the contract can be sent to your customers, vendors, and/or you on a timely basis.

"LatinSummit - presented during the World Bank Annual Meetings","
Hi Mr. Skilling,
I am hoping that you can direct me to the correct  person to vet a sponsorship opportunity to the LatinSummit. The LatinSummit is a  unique forum for Enron to gain invaluable exposure at the same time as the World  Bank & IMF Annual Meetings. Below and attached is information on the  upcoming event.  Please consider this opportunity and I look forward to  hearing from you.
Sincerely,

			 The Premier Conference on  Investing in the Americas Presented during the 2001 Annual  Meeting of the World Bank Group and  the International Monetary  Fund October 1-3, 2001 Omni Shoreham Hotel - Washington  D.C.   International  Venture Partners, LLC is pleased and excited to announce our  upcoming Latin American Investment Summit (LatinSummit), the premier  conference on investing in the Americas, presented during the Annual  Meeting of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.   The LatinSummit is a unique opportunity for your  company to connect with top business executives, government officials and  other potential customers at the largest and most important annual  gathering of world leaders from the public and private sectors. Adjacent  to the LatinSummit will be the ExpoAmericas, consisting of a  maximum of fifty exhibitors, including some of the most prominent  international companies working in Latin America.   Why should your company be a Sponsor?  The Annual Meeting attracts over 15,000  participants, including presidents, ministers, other senior  government officials, as well as thousands of senior level executives  from the private sector.   The Annual Meting attracts extensive international  press coverage and is televised throughout the world. Full media  coverage.  Three-day Conference with top-level speakers  from the public and private sector. LatinSummit will explore the  unique challenges of financing public and private sector projects in  Latin America with a focus on infrastructure finance, capital markets,  commercial lending, mergers and acquisitions and private equity  investing.   Very exclusive ExpoAmericas, with no more than  50 exhibitors and open admission to all Annual Meeting and  LatinSummit attendees. Your company will have maximum  exposure.     LatinSummit will be held in the same venue as the  Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,  providing ideal networking opportunities.  Because LatinSummit is organized by IVP (www.ivp-ny.com), an investment banking firm  focused on Latin America, and not a conference organizer, we will ensure  that the agenda covers only the most poignant topics.  Presented by the organizers of Cyber Americas (www.cyber-americas.com) at the Inter-American  Development Bank's Annual Meeting in March 2001. Past sponsors include  PriceWaterhouseCoopers, Oracle, American Airlines, Optiglobe, Lucent  Technologies, Accenture, Impsat, America Online, Global Crossing,  Greenberg Traurig, Bloomberg, Exodus Communications and others. Our  experience will ensure an extremely successful  event.  We are offering a variety of sponsorship opportunities  from which to choose from. We hope that you will join us for this unique  event.  Feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Mr. Kenneth Lay
Chairman
Enron Corporation
1440 Smith Street
Houston, Texas 77002

Dear Mr. Kenneth Lay:

This brief note concerns an innovative business development opportunity in
the rapidly expanding field of B2B eProcurement/e-commerce.  I am trying to
initiate a system to fully integrate an industry that is fragmented and in
need of adding scalable 'process' efficiencies.  This will require
substantial resources that are not available to me. These resources would be
less significant to a company like Enron Corporation.  However the upside
potential would, I believe, be significant to your corporation. The risk
reward ratio in this marketplace favors the upside potential significantly.
This market is ripe for innovation because of the fundamental need to
improve product and service delivery in a cost effective and timely manner.
The process has already begun but will require a critical mass player that
can deliver open-market eProcurement.  The process related savings alone
will be approximately $11 billion annual when an effective supply chain
system is implemented. The timing is critical since in the next 18- 36
months the winners and losers would have already lined up for success and
failure.  A linchpin is needed and it could well be Enron.  I have little
doubt that Enron could do the job and become the stand-alone leader in this
field.

I am writing to Enron Corporation to determine your potential interest in a
very large global marketplace that is poised for transformation and
transition.  This marketplace is currently valued in excess of $300 billion
annual worldwide with high profit margins as well as large continuing
revenue growth rates in excess of 10% annually. There are buy and sell side
opportunities for revenues as well as a transactional fee opportunity.

What I am proposing would be the critical next innovative step to enter a
new level of global sourcing, purchasing, risk management and distribution
for this industry.

I realize the vagueness and brevity of my comments but without an existing
level of confidentiality I cannot expand these thoughts.  If you have
interest in taking one additional step to determine if my strategic concept
has merit please let me know.

Best regards,

John Manfredonia

"Re: [smu-betas] new members","Brothers of Gamma Omega - My silence is broken!  I laughed my tired old ass off this morning reading the e-mails you guys wrote in response to our newest member Justin Loweth, class of 2000.  I know I'm getting old, when I have a daughter who also graduated from college with the class of 2000! And she is my second college graduate in the family!  I read with interest the observation from ""Beek"" that our Wooglin Club is comprised of Beta's vintage 1972 to 1978, that makes me apart of that ""mystic shrine on high"", standup and be counted, brothers of the class of 1972! 
"" Tox"" what is all this crap about Hershey bars; ""Dro-w"" dead animals parts; no way!  The last time "" Good Wood"" Berry was seen he was still trying to learn how to run the "" guard release deep"" down Central Expressway.  That was in 1975 and he is still running!  You guys know that if it were not for all of us crazy bastards in the class of 1972, everyone of you would be model citizens,tea totaliers,and very boring introverts.  We brought out the best in all of you! 
Now back to Brother Justin, once a Beta - always a Beta!  If you can stand us you can stand anything,""sing to thee -Beta Theta Pi"".  Seriously, Justin's role number is #1,367; I don't remember who number # 367is (I hope not was) but this poor bastard should be our Distinguished Beta "" mother of men"".

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) has been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.
Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the

*We have run beta tests on Windows 2002 Server and have verified many of the
additional features of Windows Terminal Services
(WTS) that will be built into it.
*Our research indicates that while there have been improvements made to the
base WTS architecture, we see no evidence of Microsoft
encroaching on any of the key application management features found in
either Citrix MetaFrame 1.8 or MetaFrame XP.
*This is very good news for Citrix, as the multiple on the shares have been
unduly suppressed by the specter of MSFTs proposed
server road map.
*Windows 2002 Server (Whistler) is due for launch in March 2002, and the
next release of the Server (Blackcomb) wont occur until
late 2003-2004.
*We believe this new news should be transferred into a higher multiple for
the shares immediately. We are comfortable with 40X on a
potential $1.00 per share (we are currently at $0.92) for FY02.

Rank 2 3
*We remain cautious on AE's shares near-term and are lowering our rating to
3 Market Perform from 2 Buy as near-term fundamentals
will likely remain weak due to continued order cancellations & pushouts. We
also believe excess channel component inventory will
weigh negatively on AE near-term. Bottom line is that we see more near-term
downside to AE's share price than upside.
*Our rating downgrade is driven by: 1) weak end mkt demand and excess OEM
component inventory and 2) no earnings visibility.
We believe that 4Q01 and 2002 street earnings ests. are too high and we
expect AE to lower near-term expectations when it reports
3Q earnings on October 11.
*AE's customers do not have any material degree of confidence that their
orders have bottomed. This was evidenced by NVLS' conf
call last Thur when it lowered expectations for 3Q01 orders and set the
stage for lower 4Q01 expectations.
*As a result we are lowering our '01 & '02 EBG ests. We are also reducing
our price target to $20.

Rank 3 3
*We expect NSM to report Aug qtr results this Thursday in-line with the cos
guidance of revs down 15-20% q/q. We believe the co. is
working down inventory and is benefiting from an uptick in wireless (25%
sales) and PCs (15% sales). However, we remain cautious
on the stock given the Nov qtr outlook may be weaker than expected.
*We believe early signs of a sustained recovery in wireless are pre-mature
given comments by Ericsson that a broad recovery is still 1-2
qtrs away. Also, we believe those investors looking for strong
back-to-school selling season (PCs) will likely be disappointed.
*With NSM up 21% since Jul 2nd, we believe it fully reflects the firming of
demand in wireless and PCs, but does not discount a
potentially disappointing Nov qtr. As a result, we think the stock could
trade down into the mid-$20s assuming the company needs to
lower street ests for the Nov qtr, which we are modeling at +5% q/q rev
growth. We believe guidance could call for revs flat to
slightly up q/q.

Rank 1 3
*We are lowering our rating on Diebold's stock to 3 Market Perform from 1
Strong Buy on valuation. The stock has increased 53%
since we recommended it in March '00 vs a 24% drop in the S&P 500, and is at
our $40 price target. At 19x est 02 EPS of $2.10 we
believe the stock is fully valued.
*There has been a lot of good news surrounding Diebold's stock in recent
months, including ATM (automated teller machine)
European market penetration, cost cutting initiatives, the exit of
competitor Mosler from the bank security products business,
expansion of its voting machine business, and progress in supplying
components for self-service supermarket checkout. Also, new
management (in the past two years) is focused on international growth and
improving margins. Diebold's strong debt-free (net)
balance sheet will enable it to continue to make strategic acquisitions.
While these factors point to a positive outlook for Diebold, we
believe the stock price fully reflects the potential. Diebold's stock has
traded primarily in a range of 12-20x earnings over the past
decade and is currently near the high end of that range.

AUGUST SAME-STORE SALES PREVIEW
*Retailers report August comps on Thursday, September 6.
*Back-to-School essentially in-line with reduced expectations. Maintain
selectivity. Many retailers have seen little benfit from rebate
checks. Our Q4 study shows retailers underperform in Q4.
*Home Furnishing- Back-to-School slightly below plan for some retailers -
consumers gravitate towards promotionally-priced
merchandise.
*Home Improvement- 2Q comps represent the first qtr of sequential
improvement. Look for easier comps/lumber comparisons to
boost comps in 2H01. Positive implications of Fed's 300 bp reduction in
rates not likely to help fundamentals until 1H02.
*Consumer Electronics- Sales only marginally aided by benefits of rebate
checks. Look for new product introductions like Xbox and
Gamecube to help boost comps in 4Q.

Rank 2 2
*Devon announced yesterday that it would acquire Anderson Expl for US$4.6
bn. Acq'n price is equivalent to a debt-adjusted cash
flow multiple of 8.0-8.5 times -- a sharp premium to Devon's trading
multiple of about 5 times. We are lowering our target price from
$69 to $53 to reflect the premium paid for the acq'n. Our revised target
assumes that DVN's multiple will expand from 5.0 times
PICF for DVN standalone to about 6.5 times. However the premium price paid
has led us to lower our target price -- maintaining buy
rating.
*Acquisition will expand reserves by 35 percent -- but firm value will rise
by 44 percent.
*If investors were to value the acquired cash flows at the same multiple
that Devon trades at, the shares would need to fall by more
than $10 per share from the $46 pre-announcement share price.
*We will review our earnings & cash flow estimates once we receive guidance
from the company.

Rank N 2
*Celgene has established a valuable franchise in oncology with lead product
Thalomid, which we think can achieve peak sales of $230
million.
*The IMiDs and SelCID programs have been devised to build on the success of
Thalomid and potentially yield new drugs for
inflammatory diseases and cancers. The company also has a drug discovery
platform in gene regulation.
*We expect Ritadex for attention deficit disorder (licensed to Novartis) to
be a contributor to revenues from 2002 onwards. The
product's success will ultimately depend on additional clinical data as well
as development of new formulations.
*We have valued Celgene by applying a 65 multiple to our 2005 EPS (fully
taxed) of $1.30. Discounting this at 30% per year over
three years gives us a 12 month price target of $38.

*We must reiterate our enthusiasm for HDI following our tour of the co's
York, PA plant yesterday. We are particularly excited about
the prospects for the plant expansion as we firmly believe the new facility
could spur the gross margin expansion we have been
discussing for some time now. Despite concerns overhanging the rest of the
consumer sector, we continue to believe in the HDI story
and reiterate our 1-Strong Buy rating.
*We have toured the York plant before and found that little has changed. As
always, the facility was humming with production. But, it
also appeared to be bursting at the seams in terms of capacity.
*Managers we spoke with conveyed to us a high morale about current business.
But, even more noticeable was an excitement about
the plant expansion which is scheduled to open in 2003.
*While HDI continuously strives to improve margins, we believe sig. growth
could come from this new plant. Based on prior
expansions, HDI's gross margins could benefit over 100 basis points.

Rank 2 2
*We are lowering our FY01 and FY02 EPS estimates to reflect the revised
earnings guidance for FY01 and lower long term growth
rate going forward. Despite the fact that the shares were down 20%, we do
not view this weakness as a buying opportunity and
continue to maintain our cautious stance on the name given the uncertainty
of earnings going forward.
*We are lowering our FY01 earnings estimate to $3.20 from $3.25 and our FY02
estimate to $3.49 from $3.91. We are lowering our
price target to $40, which represents 11.5x our FY02 estimate.
*The company provided guidance for net credit loss performance in 4Q01 and
FY02. The company noted that it expects the net credit
loss rate to be in the 10.45% -10.75% range for 4Q01 with credit loss rates
running at or above that range in FY02.
*We believe the biggest reason for the change in guidance is the lack of
success in generating profitable loan growth in the Prime &
Super Prime segments and higher than expected credit costs.

*The tone of the ABS analyst meeting was upbeat, although the company
provided very little new information to justify its currently
high valuation (2001 P/E of 18.0). ABS is trading higher than both Safeway
(2001 P/E of 17.3x) and Kroger (2001 P/E of 17.9x),
both of which have far stronger and clearer earnings prospects, as well as
better long-term competitive positioning. We are therefore
maintaining our 3-Market Perform rating.
*ABS reported 2Q01 EPS of $0.45, $0.02 ahead of our estimates and $0.01
ahead of consensus. Sales were in line with our estimates,
but the operating margin deteriorated by only 42 bp versus the 58 bp we had
forecast.
*We have raised our 3Q01 estimate from $0.37 to $0.44, and our FY02
estimates from $1.81 to $1.93. For the full year, we are
forecasting that sales grow 3.6% to $38.073 billion, while we now expect the
operating margins to deteriorate 27 bp versus our
previous estimate for a 54 bp deterioration.

I went up there to ride with some of my NERC friends, and Mike was very impressed with our jerseys.  I figured the humor of the situation just had to be well documented.

I enjoyed visiting with you, Lou, and Greg last week.
I haven't heard anything back, and so wanted to check

"Shift May Empower California.htm","
Thanks for taking time to call  yesterday.  Good luck with the Lockyer situation.  I truly do believe  that direct and prompt interaction with Lockyer will prove more effective for  Enron than delayed or intermediated action.    As we discussed,  if I can be of any help with reconnaissance or as sounding  board, just let me know.
 
I have attached an article from  this morning's LA Times.  It provides an California view on how the  shakeup in the Senate might impact the state's energy  situation.  Certainly, by the time that President Bush visits  the California in a few days, the state's two Democratic US  Senators will be a good bit more empowered.

Jeffords has never mattered much to Californians. Until now.        The Vermont senator's widely anticipated  decision to abandon his fellow Republicans and put Democrats in control of  the Senate could have big implications for California, particularly on  energy and environmental policy, lawmakers and lobbyists said Wednesday.        The change, which Jeffords is expected  to announce today, could increase political pressure on the Bush  administration to respond more aggressively to California's electricity  crisis, these insiders said.       And it  might force the White House to compromise on key elements of the national  energy policy it unveiled last week. In fact, the administration's  proposed budget cuts for programs to promote renewable energy were said to  be a factor in Jeffords' decision.       At  the very least, Senate observers said, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is  likely to get the floor vote she has sought on price controls for  wholesale electricity.       That doesn't  necessarily mean that the administration's critics will be able to have  everything their way. Even if the Senate approves electricity price caps,  for example, the measure would face stiff opposition in the GOP-dominated  House--and a likely veto if it made it to the president's desk.        Still, a Democratic majority in the  Senate would give Feinstein and other party members a platform to turn up  the political heat on the administration and congressional Republicans on  energy policy.       ""It kicks up the dust,""  groaned one energy industry lobbyist who requested anonymity.        Observed Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.):  ""If President Bush's hard-edged conservative approach has in fact caused  the balance to shift towards Democrats in the Senate, it will have  profound implications not just for California, but for the environment and  our nation's energy policy.""        Environmentalists seemed almost giddy as  they contemplated the possible impact of Jeffords' decision on the  policies they care about.       All of a  sudden, they said, it seems less likely that oil exploration will take  place in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, that recreational  snowmobiles will have free access to Yellowstone National Park, or that  the administration's desire to promote nuclear power will be embraced by  Congress.       On the other hand, it seems  more probable that Congress would approve a new plan for managing a vast  swath of the Sierra Nevada to protect the region's oldest trees, consider  legislation to restrict emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants and  protect California from a resurgence of offshore oil drilling.        ""It's stunning how broad the  repercussions are, particularly on the environment,"" said Gregory Wetstone  of the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""We're trying not to count our  chickens before they hatch. But it will be easier for us in our battles at  least to keep from moving backwards.""        For instance, Jeffords is a chief  advocate of a bill that would regulate carbon dioxide from power plants.  And if events play out as expected, he'll become the new chairman of the  Senate committee with jurisdiction over the issue.        Another issue under his purview would be  the two-decade dispute over a proposed repository for the nation's spent  nuclear fuel at Yucca Mountain in Nevada.        ""Yucca Mountain is a dead turkey,""  declared Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society.        Environmentalists had been worried that  a number of pro-development provisions would be packed into appropriation  bills. But with Democratic senators in charge, that would become less of a  threat, they said.       ""Every wacko idea  Republicans have will get a higher level of scrutiny,"" Francis said.        The biggest change would be the power of  Senate Democrats to decide which bills will be considered in committees,  and which ones will make it to the floor of the Senate for votes.        As part of a new Democratic majority,  Feinstein and fellow California Democrat Barbara Boxer are likely to gain  leverage with the administration on a number of issues considered  important to the state.       ""That translates  into more federal assistance for California across the board,"" predicted  Steve Maviglio, spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis.        ""I think it means more attention to our  state, for sure,"" Boxer said. ""Right now, the president doesn't seem to  give a darn. They're all looking at California as a Democratic state.  They're not interested.""       Feinstein, who  has been unable to arrange a meeting with Bush to discuss the energy  crisis, may get better treatment if winning Democratic support becomes  more important to the administration. She has been regarded as a  bridge-builder who worked effectively with Republicans in the past.        ""This has not been a warm and friendly  administration,"" she complained Wednesday. ""They've got people who know  all the answers and don't want to listen.""        The White House disputed that. In fact,  Bush agreed Wednesday to meet with Davis during the president's first  visit to California next week.       Under a  Democratic majority, Feinstein would be in line to chair two  subcommittees: the military construction panel of the Senate  Appropriations Committee, and the technology, terrorism and government  information subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee.        Boxer would be in line to chair the  subcommittee on Superfund, waste control and risk assessment, and the  Foreign Relations subcommittee on international operations and terrorism.        Maviglio predicted that the effects of  Jeffords' expected party defection would be felt immediately.        The chairmanship of the Senate Energy  and Natural Resources Committee would be taken away from Frank H.  Murkowski (R-Alaska), who has been ""openly hostile to California's  plight,"" and handed to Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), who supports Davis' request  for electricity price controls, according to Maviglio.        Democrats have assailed Bush's energy  plan for tilting heavily toward the supply side. With Democrats in charge  of the Senate, the administration would be more likely to compromise,  perhaps beefing up funding for Democrat-supported causes such as increased  energy assistance to low-income households and more aggressive promotion  of conservation and renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power.

Dear Harvard Alumni:

I am a recent Harvard College graduate (June 2001) and have moved back to
Houston to develop an HIV/AIDS youth education project.  I was temporarily
collaborating with the Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative
(BIPAI) at the Baylor College of Medicine and am now seeking to partner
with AIDS Foundation Houston.  I aim to launch Grades4AIDS in H.I.S.D.
during the 2002-2003 academic year as either an AFH project or an
independent NPO.  This organization seeks to simultaneously promote
academic achievement, community service, peer-to-peer HIV/AIDS youth
education, and youth leadership while also fundraising for pediatric AIDS
research and support.  The following is the basic premise of our project:

A corporate sponsor will agree to donate $0.50 (this amount will be
corrected annually with increased participation) per B+ or above (or
equivalent measure, i.e. 88-90) that every participating student receives
during every grading period.  Peer tutoring and interscholastic incentive
programs will encourage students to achieve.  Participating students will
engage in an active dialogue about HIV/AIDS and have myriad opportunities
to get involved in and lead peer education initiatives and volunteer in the
Houston HIV/AIDS community.

What I am seeking from the Harvard alumni in Houston is support in the form
of contributions of time and/or money.  We are currently putting together
an Advisory Board and Board of Trustees and working hard to fund our
project and operational costs through May 2003.

Please visit our website at www.grades4aids.org for more information and
feel free to contact me at dmkim@post.harvard.edu.  I can also be reached
by telephone at (713) 932-8822.  Thank you very much for your time.

Sincerely,

Dona Kim

"Enron and United Way's Continued Partnership","
Last month all of your donations helped Enron raise a grand total of $6 million for the United Way, including our corporate match.  Once again Enron employees made a difference and contributed more than any other pacesetter company in Houston. Also, congratulations to Elaine Brown with Enron Global Markets who won the drawing for two round-trip airline tickets for participating in this year's campaign.  Thanks to everyone at Enron for your generosity!

This week Enron and the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast have entered in to yet another exciting partnership. Beginning with the Astros vs Giants game on Tuesday, October 2, one of Enron's primary signs at Enron Field will feature the United Way logo alongside the Enron logo.

The decision to include United Way's logo on the sign marks the first time in history that a naming rights partner is sharing exposure on one of its primary in-stadium signage locations with a non-profit partner.  This sign is also a free, innovative way to demonstrate Enron's support of the United Way and promote the agency's role in our community.

The millions of fans who attend Astros games each season will see the sign.  Be sure to look for this history-making sign hanging high above the outfield.

"An opportunity to contribute to Global IP Carriers 2002 programme, 17-19 April 2002, The Royal Garden Hotel, London...","Dear Mr Skilling,

As conference director for Global IP Carriers 2002, I would like to speak to
you to discuss the focus of next year's conference programme and to discuss
speaking opportunities at the event. It is a well established event for IP
wholesale and IP carriers infrastructure market and I would expect 100+
delegates for next year's conference. A tightly focused programme is most
crucial at this stage and this is the initial reason for contacting you as a
player within the marketplace.

IP networks are capable of delivering cost control and new revenues to
carriers. Internet traffic will grow, albeit not as fast as previously
predicted and we are moving towards all IP networks, certainly for the new
carriers. The areas that I would like to discuss with you cover a broad
range and if you would like to respond only on certain topics that is fine -
all feedback is invaluable for focusing the programme. The broad areas to be
covered include -

Quality of service - what architectures deliver? MPLS vs Diffserv? Gigabit
Ethernet vs ATM?
Service provisioning - areas of growth for service providers and will there
be self provisioning?
What methods of diffentiation are IP carriers at the edge of the network?
Bundling of services - challenges and opportunities
Customer loyalty and churn - strategies for building customer bases and CRM
Areas for revenue growth - value added services that will grow your revenue
IP VPNs - are they the killer app that will encourage enterprises to pay for
new fiber?
VoIP - predictions for uptake and challenges
IP Telephony - economies of scale for new carriers? implications for margins
of incumbents?
Access technologies - what is happening in the IP local loop
How softswitching is going to impact costs and its real advantages
Billing - IP Interconnect and implications for service provisioning
Costs of OSS and business support systems
What enterprise case studies you would like to hear about and what industry
sectors are the most relevant to you?

The delegate profile for the event will be CEOs, CFOs, Strategy & Planning
Directors, International Network Directors, Sales Directors, Marketing
Directors, Business Development Directors, CTOs, IT Directors, Network
Architects and MDs of the following markets -

IP Carriers
ISPs
Bandwidth Exchanges
Optical networking equipment vendors
Consultants
Systems integrators
Billing vendors
OSS suppliers

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss the above topics with you and any
other topics you may feel should be included in the programme. If you would
like to hear from particular speakers also, please let me know and I will
endeavour to invite them to participate. There are speaking opportunities on
the programme as it is very much in its nascent stages and when I have a
draft programme written I would like to discuss participation with you.

I look forward to hearing from you soon as I am on a tight deadline as
always and ideally would like to speak to you for a short time sometime this
week.

Kind regards

"[smu-betas] False alarm for Grumps","Brothers,
    Grumps ended up being treated for really nothing.  Once they got a good
look at the artery, they found it only to be 30% blocked (had been 100%
blocked the surgery before) and there's really nothing to do with that small
a blockage.  So, it's really good news.  Guess those echo cardiograms aren't
always real accurate.  It showed it blocked, causing the second procedure to
be prescribed.  All for naught, thank God.

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

"Important message: Annual Meeting 2002","To the attention of:
Mr Jeffrey K. Skilling
President and Chief Executive Officer
Enron



Dear Mr Skilling,

These are extraordinary times for all of us, and I want to share with you
important news concerning our next Annual Meeting.

The events of 11 September and their aftermath have created a special
interest in our upcoming Annual Meeting. We all share the understanding
that we are living in a new era of fragility and are looking for signposts
that establish a way forward. Participation in our Annual Meeting of top
business, political, intellectual and civil society leaders promises to
make our Annual Meeting, more than ever before, the place where we confront
our problems head-on.

This calls for an Annual Meeting that is much more interactive than in the
past. We therefore have developed a programme concept designed to engage
our Members and participants in dynamic discussion and problem solving on
key aspects of the Global Agenda. We appeal to you to consult the programme
concept from 15 November onwards on our website (http://www.weforum.org)
and to provide us with your feedback as soon as possible.

In order to develop a road map of international cooperation for the future,
we believe the most pressing issues for us to tackle are reversing the
global economic slowdown, bridging the poverty and educational divides,
enhancing security and improving cultural understanding throughout the
world. With these as our goals, we felt that New York would be the ideal
place for our next Annual Meeting. The decision has the enthusiastic
approval of the Forum's Foundation Board and Business Council as well as
the full support of Governor George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. The
Annual Meeting 2002 will represent an unparalleled effort to mobilize all
the leaders behind our mission: to bring business and society together in
partnership to improve the state of the world.

We will work closely with your staff to provide all necessary information
related to travel, accommodation and security. The Meeting will start on
Thursday 31 January and end on Monday 4 February 2002. The principal
location will be the Hotel Waldorf Astoria.

We will spare no efforts to make sure that the informal spirit of Davos and
its hard-working atmosphere are not only preserved but intensified, and
that the Meeting will be truly outstanding in its collective impact. We are
confident that we can count on you to give this exceptional ""Davos in New
York"" your full support and engagement.

Founder and President

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Cost Data Spread the Blame Power: Many suppliers charged more
than the firms that Davis has pilloried, records show.
RICH CONNELL; ROBERT J. LOPEZ; DOUG SMITH
TIMES STAFF WRITERS

07/10/2001
Los Angeles Times
Home Edition

SACRAMENTO -- California's energy meltdown involves a far more diverse
group of wholesale electricity merchants than suggested by Gov. Gray Davis,
who has aggressively blamed a handful of Texas companies, state records
show.


During the first three months of this year--one of the worst stretches of
power shortages during the crisis--an assortment of public and private
entities charged the state prices averaging well above some of those paid
to Texas firms, according to documents released to The Times on Monday by
the Department of Water Resources, which now buys power for California.


Among those setting and collecting some of the highest average prices per
megawatt-hour were a Canadian public utility, a subsidiary of San Diego Gas
& Electric's parent company, and the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power, the report shows. Their average prices ranged from $498 a
megawatt-hour charged by Powerex, the trading arm of British Columbia's BC
Hydro, to $292 an hour by the DWP.


In fact, some of the biggest private power companies singled out for
criticism by Davis and other state officials--Dynegy Inc., Duke Energy and
Mirant--charged less than the average prices the state paid for the period.
Those companies' average prices ranged from $146 to $240 per megawatt-hour,
according to an analysis of the documents.


The figures cover the various types of spot and longer-term power purchased
by the state during three months that included rolling blackouts and more
than a month of razor-thin reserves, leading to continuous power
emergencies.


Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor has directed his sharpest
barbs at private out-of-state generators because, in general, they have
reaped the highest profits over the longest period.


""You have to look at the whole picture,"" Maviglio said.


""The governor was expressing his displeasure with the arrogance of the
generators who wear cowboy hats,"" he said. ""Their profits were 100% to 400%
above last year. . . . Just because there are other entities who are
charging us more [per megawatt-hour] doesn't change the fact that we are
getting ripped off by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""


The report by the Department of Water Resources was provided to The Times
on the same day the state released 1,700 pages of documents on California's
electricity purchases on the volatile spot market for the year's first
quarter.


The records detail how the state spent nearly $8 billion buying power in
the first five months of the year, and underscore the complexity of the
state's energy problem. They also show that patterns of high prices are not
limited to a few generators.


Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the water resources agency, said that the
reports together show that prices were extremely volatile early in the
year. ""All the prices were high,"" he said, noting the downward trend in
costs since his agency began buying power in mid-January.


The average price per megawatt-hour for all state purchases went from $316
in January to $243 in May. Spot prices fell from an average of $321 per
hour to $271, the reports show.


In the first quarter of the year, some public entities' prices far exceeded
those of the biggest private companies. For example, Houston-based Enron,
one of the nation's biggest power traders, charged an average of $181 per
megawatt-hour. And Atlanta-based Mirant, which sold the most to the state,
a total of $706 million, charged an average of $225 per megawatt-hour.


By contrast, a Calgary, Canada, firm, TransAlta Energy, averaged $335 a
megawatt-hour, and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District had average
charges of $330 per megawatt-hour.


A spokesman for Enron, Mark Palmer, said recently that the ""vilification of
Enron was based on politics, not facts."" Spokesmen for BC Hydro could not
be reached late Monday to comment on its huge sales to the state. In the
past, the utility has defended its pricing practices, saying it has offered
last-minute hydroelectric power that helped keep California's lights on.


A spokeswoman for Sempra, the parent company of San Diego Gas & Electric,
said late Monday the company was unable to comment because it had yet to
see the figures released by the state. Officials at DWP, who could not be
reached Monday evening, have defended their pricing, saying the costs of
producing the power needed by the state were extremely high.


More Power Bought Than Projected


Hidalgo, of the Department of Water Resources, said his agency's efforts,
coupled with conservation by business and consumers and falling natural gas
prices, have begun to tame the state's market.


Still, the state had to purchase $321 million in power in April and May,
about 10% more than Davis' analysts had projected.


Hidlago said that was because of hot weather in May and other supply
problems in April. He said reports will show that power purchases fell
short of state projections in June and early July.


The reports also will show that prices paid by the state were down in June
and July, partly because spot prices have fallen sharply, often to well
under $100 a megawatt-hour.


A summary Department of Water Resources report released Monday credited
Davis' program of nurturing new power generation and establishing long-term
power contracts with with ""moving the California electric energy industry
closer to normalcy.""

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

"McKinsey alums/Energy Fund","Dear Jeff:

I learned about your decision to resign from the CEO role at Enron. As a
McKinsey alum who has watched you transform Enron from a pipeline operator
to the world's foremost energy/trading company, it is hard for me to imagine
Enron without you.  Enron's strategies based on 'options thinking' and
investments in growth options inspired my work on 'real options' which
turned out to be the winner in McKinsey's worldwide Practice Olympics in
1995 (thought you might like a copy of an offshoot).

I left McKinsey to join Morgan Stanley in 1997 and I am currently running
KnowledgeCube, a venture capital firm with a couple of McKinsey alums such
as Ali Hanna (Stamford) and some classmates from MIT.  Our Advisors include
the Heads of Entrepreneurship at MIT, Stanford, Harvard, CMU and Cornell.
Our investors include Rajat Gupta of McKinsey, the CEO Hughes Networks and
MDs from institutions such as AIG and CSFB.

KnowledgeCube has just launched a $150M Energy Fund which would invest in IT
companies that seek to enhance the productivity of the energy sector.  We
have partnered with some folks with global relationships and knowledge of
the space including Lord Cecil Parkinson (Energy Secretary of UK).

I was wondering if I could persuade you to be a part of the KnowledgeCube
network as a Lead Partner, Advisor or Investor.  I will arrange to send some
more information on KnowledgeCube and the proposed Energy Fund to your home
address if that is OK with you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

    Thursday, November 01, 2001 Issue 40   EDITORIAL  In this edition...  ...we take a closer look at the state of play in the green energy market, and also at technologies, not planned or anticipated, but with us right now that can bring alternative energy strategies to fruition.   There are just a few remaining places on the delegate register for the Eyeforenergy Green Convention in Brussels next week, so if you are intending to go and haven't yet registered - please do so today!   In 'Going Green: The Bottom Line', the first of our two articles on green energy, Abyd Karmali, VP of ICF Consulting, points to the increasing importance of emissions trading as a key environmental issue.  We also examine the relative market share currently enjoyed (or lamented?) by the main renewable energy initiatives: wind, solar, biomass and fuel cells.   Speakers are lining up rapidly for our three co-located events in Amsterdam, 19-21 February 2002: Energy Trading Online, Weather Trading and Emissions Trading.  Recently confirmed include Enron, LIFFE, TXU and NatSource.  The programmes for all three are likely to be filled over the next couple of weeks, so if you are interested in speaking please contact Allison Robertshaw (arobertshaw@eyeforenergy.com ) for Energy and Weather Trading and Meabh Quoirin (mquoirin@eyeforenergy.com ) for Emissions Trading as soon as possible.   I hope you enjoy this edition of the Eyeforenergy Briefing: your feedback, as always, is welcome and can be directed to bruno@eyeforenergy.com .    --Sarah Robinson, Marketing & PR Director    FOCUS   Technology Driving Green Energy   Recent events have served to highlight the need to reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil reserves and strengthen our resolve to bring alternative forms of energy into mainstream use. Most of the energy used today comes from fossil fuel, resulting in green house gas (GHG) emissions being released into the atmosphere at ever increasing rates.  Indeed, the environment is as much a player in developing the coming hydrogen economy as reducing our dependence on foreign oil reserves. Carbon and sulphur dioxides are having a decided impact on our environment, contributing to climate change and acid rain. As any school boy can attest, energy...

With most of the European Union, particularly France, Italy, Greece and Portugal, dominated by tired old state monopolies, the opening of markets to competition is moving technology to the front burner as power companies jockey for position in the race to keep pace with new opportunities.  Green power initiatives move front and center, as concerns over the impact climate change will have on rate structures when most EU markets become fully deregulated by 2005.

"The Morning Market Call - Wednesday June 6th, 2001."," <<MF June 6th 2001.pdf>>

			Good Wednesday Morning - Comments From The Local
Guys!

Yesterday, we received revised numbers on first quarter productivity, which
came in at -1.2% quarter-over-quarter on an annualized basis. On a
year-over-year basis, productivity remains at a relatively healthy 2.5%
rate, although this is half the pace at which it was running less than one
year ago. A slowdown in productivity is not unusual during an economic
slowdown. Corporations face fixed costs, while business is declining.
Unfortunately, that is why there are layoffs. With lower corporate costs,
productivity should improve as the economy picks up steam. Tomorrow, the
market will be receiving the weekly initial jobless claims, which are
expected to remain near last week's level. Lehman Brothers' economists look
for first-time unemployment insurance filings to total 415,000 for the week
ended Saturday, June 2.

The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.65%.
The 10-year note yield is 5.25%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.83%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $27.44 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $3.85 p/mcf.

			AD Time:

New Federal Insider-Trading Rule (Rule 10b5-1) have been adopted by the SEC
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This rule greatly enhances an
insider's/employee's ability to trade his/her corporate shares during
blackout periods.
Previously, without the protection of this new SEC rule, employees and
insiders could safely trade only outside of designated blackout windows.
Under this new rule, insiders/employees may have the ability to purchase and
sell their corporate shares even during blackout periods if a written plan
was established and in force when the insider/employee was not in possession
of material, non-public information.
The new rule contains other restrictions and should be reviewed carefully.

Lehman Brothers has established a turn-key plan that take into account the
regulatory procedures for establishing such a plan.    Please email us or
call us for more information.

IMPACT CALLS

Procter & Gamble(PG) 2 - Buy A. Gillin Lefever, .212.526.5801
Morphing Into An Attack Aircraft Carrier
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $63.6 EPS 2000 N/A $2.95 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $79 - 53 EPS 2001 $3.10E $3.10E $3.11E 20.5
Mkt Cap: $90.8B EPS 2002 $3.25E $3.25E $3.27E 19.6
FY: 6/30 Price Target $69 $69
Rank 3 2
*We are upgrading PG to a Buy (2) rating based upon what we perceive as a
good trading opportunity in front of their June 15 outlook
meeting. We expect the meeting to highlight (1) more aggressive actions to
reduce PG's asset base than previously telegraphed; (2)
expect FY 02's recurring earnings growth to be confirmed at the
consensus-implied 6-8% rates and (3) expect previously stated long-term
growth targets to remain in place.
*Cost cutting /right-sizing remains the theme for the balance of the
calendar year / majority of FY 02. A very focused effort will
improve PG's competitiveness, but there is a reasonable probability PG will
exceed the previously telegraphed $400-$800 M in
incremental restructuring charges in order to further accelerate the
restructuring process.
*PG is slowly shifting its attention to sales growth but 4-6% long-term
growth is at least one fiscal year out. Maximum upside is
$72.00 absent any earnings-enhancing news.

National Service Indus(NSI) 3 - Market Perform D. Zwyer, .212.526.2008
Lowering Rating As Stock Approaches Price Target
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $25.73 EPS 2000 N/A $2.45 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $27 - 18 EPS 2001 $2.00E $2.00E $2.07E 12.9
Mkt Cap: $1.1B EPS 2002 $2.30E $2.30E $2.30E 11.2
FY: 8/31 Price Target $27 $27
Rank 1 3
*We are lowering our rating on National Service Industries' stock to 3
(Market Perform) from 1 (Strong Buy) based on valuation. The
stock has increased 37% since we initiated coverage on September 27, 2000,
outperforming a 10% drop in the S&P 500, and is near
our $27 price target. At about $26, NSI's stock trades at 13 times est.
fiscal (August) 2001 EPS of $2.00, and 11 times est. 2002 EPS
of $2.30. We do not see significant upside in the stock price from current
levels, and believe the shares will move with the market in
the near-term rather than outperform.
*We continue to expect difficult earnings comparisons for the second half of
2001, with a flattish 3Q (May) and a lower 4Q compared
with the prior year level. For the full year 2001, we expect lower earnings
in all segments: lighting, chemicals, linen rental, and
envelope. The risk to earnings going forward is a worse than expected drop
in non-residential construction impacting the company's
lighting business. Also, a drop in consumer spending would impact the linen
rental business.

Power 	D. Ford, .212.526.0836
No, The Sky is NOT Falling
*A change in investor sentiment towards the wholesale market has resulted in
a sell-off in the energy merchant stocks. We believe this
sell-off has been overdone and would recommend buying shares of Aquila,
Dynegy and Mirant.
*In our opinion, the apparent change in sentiment has been the result of
three factors: 1) a sector shift into tech stocks; 2) increased
perceived political risks on both the federal and state levels; and 3)
concerns about the potential for contracting commodity prices and
margins.
*While we do not see any catalysts that will stem this flow in the
near-term, we believe that preannouncement and upside earnings
surprises are just around the corner.
*Our favorite picks are energy merchants: Aquila, Dynegy and Mirant.


Global Crossing(GX) 2 - Buy D. Fletcher, .212.526.3375
Near-term Opportunity In Weighing Positives vs. Negatives
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $12.94 EPS 2000 N/A -$4.04 N/A N/A

Mkt Cap: $11.4B EPS 2002 -$3.19E -$3.19E -$3.15E N/A
FY: 12/31 Price Target $28 $28
Rank 2 2
*With the stock approaching all time lows, we believe positives outweigh
negatives here, and stock offers good near term upside.
*While long term challenges remain, such as dependence on IRUs for
growth/funding, GX is off 24% in last two weeks, is making
good progress in Commercial and is a clear leader in the bandwidth sector.
We believe there is good near term upside. In terms of
DCF valuation, we get to $15-$20/share, even haircutting our (below
guidance) #'s by 20%.
*GX has signed >$600M in Commercial contracts year-to-date, and Comm Svcs
grew 7% seq, in Q1, and should grow 9%+ in Q2.
*The subsea market is rationalizing, and the 4 major subsea players could
become 2 over next 12 mos.
*Long-term challenges include IRU sales, and 01 guidance may prove
aggressive, though we believe that is in the stock, and we
believe the company can hit our 01 Cash Rev number of $6.71B, +30% Y-Y.

*The risk is the elimination of a steady income stream. But, the value of a
REIT is the tax benefit & higher Returns to MCD; lower
MCD earnings (no rental income) would be more than offset by ownership of
the REIT & its tax-free benefits
Back-of-envelope analysis yields $270mil in value ($0.20/share) due to
shifting the rental income of owned sites under franchised
stores to non-taxable status; other benefits are likely.

Addressing the Balance Sheet and Other Concerns
OLD NEW STREET P/E
Price: $61.90 EPS 2000 N/A $2.29 N/A N/A
52 Wk Ra: $67 - 38 EPS 2001 $2.63E $2.63E $2.64E 23.5
Mkt Cap: $29.6B EPS 2002 $2.98E $2.98E $3.00E 20.8
FY: 12/31 Price Target $75 $75
Rank 2 2
*EDS shares have underperformed the major indices and CSC shares since
reporting strong 1Q01 results. We attribute this to some
concerns around the recent acquisitions, the need to access the public
markets to finance these deals and the increase in DSO's and the
drop in cash flow reported in 1Q01.
*Late last week we had a private call with the controller of EDS to address
the balance sheet issues. We believe that the key issue is
the volume of large deals ramping in 1H01. Receivable terms on large
outsourcing deals are often extended in the early stages of
contracts. On selected large deals, we also suspect that EDS (and perhaps
others) may be offering up-front price discounts, adding to
the cash flow requirement although average margins over the life of a
contract appear stable. We do not expect DSO's to decrease
materially until perhaps 4Q01.
*At 23 times forward estimated EPS for a 15% EPS growth rate story with high
visibility, we remain comfortable with EDS and our 2-
Buy rating.

COMPANY/INDUSTRY UPDATES

Integrated Oil P. Cheng, .212.526.1884
Weekly U.S. Crude Oil & Refined Products Inventory Summary
*Absent any new major refinery or pipeline accidents, we expect gasoline
futures to drop to below $0.80 per gallon within the next
several weeks. In addition, gasoline inventories should continue to build on
average by about 0.5-1.0 million barrels per week over
the next two months due to strong domestic output and weak demand. We
continue to recommend an underweight position in the
independent refiners group.

Paper & Forest Products P. Ruschmeier, .212.526.9898
IRS Revenue Ruling Supports Bullish Timber Thesis
*As we indicated yesterday (6/5/01), IRS revenue ruling 2001-29 has positive
implications for the pending merger between PCL and
TGP and positive implications for a structural shift in timber ownership
from C-Corps to REITs over time. We are reiterating our
favorable ratings on companies with the greatest timberland exposure
including WY, LPX, TIN, BCC, IP, BOW, & TGP.
*Yesterday (6/5/01) we learned that the IRS reversed a 1973 revenue ruling
that prevents REITs from engaging in the active conduct
of a trade or business.
*We believe the ruling is an important first step in paving the way for
timber-rich companies to transition ownership of timber cash
flow from a C-corp. structure to a tax-advantaged REIT structure.
*We believe the ruling supports a favorable outcome to the PCL/TGP merger.

Internet Healthcare R. Rouse, .212.526.7347
MORE CRO UPSIDE - THE BIOTECHS ARE COMING !!!
*The CROs are poised to take advantage of two significant trends that we
pose are underway: 1. the much anticipated ""biotech bulge""
may be upon us sooner than expected (a long-term catalyst); and 2. this is
in addition to our previous call for efficiency gains and
margin upside given a return to normalized late-stage trial volume (a
near-term catalyst).
*Proprietary pipeline analysis and industry anecdotes lead us to the
proposition that the beginning of a wave of novel drugs is entering
clinical development. This creates bottlenecks for drug sponsors and
opportunities for service vendors. Diversified CROs (CVD,
PPDI, & QTRN) and niche providers (AAII & ARRY) could reap benefits as early
as this year while those more clinically focused
(KNDL & PRXL) could see upside by the end of next year.

Insurance/Life E. Berg, .212.526.2805
Estate Tax Reform: With New Focus Any Damage Will Be Minor
*An effort by us to quantify the impact on life insurers of the change in
the Federal estate-tax law passed last week by Congress is
leading us to affirm our 1-Strong Buy ratings on Manulife, Nationwide, and
John Hancock.
*The bottom line to our analysis: While these three life insurers and others
could lose as much as one-third of their existing estate-tax-oriented
policies and growth in new sales of estate-tax-oriented life insurance could
also slow by a third its still not a big deal. The
entire loss, between existing and new policies combined, would translate
only into about a 5 % to 10 % loss of revenues and earnings
companywide because estate planning is only a portion of their business.

Right-sizing the business is still to come

FY: 1/31 Price Target N/A N/A
Rank 3 3
*ABS is just beginning the arduous process of a turnaround, with a new CEO
that is willing and able to lead. He is evaluating every
aspect of the business, and is prepared to right size the company through
divestitures of profitable assets that have weak long-term
prospects.
*ABS reported 1Q01 EPS of $0.46, $0.01 ahead of our estimates and consensus.
Sales were in line with our estimates, but the
operating margin deteriorated by only 39 bp versus the 60 bp we had
forecast.
*We have lowered our 2Q01 estimate from $0.47 to $0.45, and our FY02
estimates from $1.96 to $1.93.
*With our new lower estimate, ABS' stock is trading at a 2001 P/E 14.4x, a
mere 1.5 multiple point discount to KR, which we rate a 1-
Strong Buy ($24.78). We think this gap is too narrow given the differences
in earnings outlook and asset quality, so we are
maintaining our 3-Market Perform rating

"Peer Group Mapping","On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding ""Peer Group Mapping"".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments 
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Dave Delainey



Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.

We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached. 

The actions points from this excercise are:

1	to review and agree the attached mapping 

2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.

3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.

      Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.

      To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
      reference.

"Rio house","Jeff,

Hope all is well with you. I'm just dropping you this note to let you know I
haven't forgotten your call concerning the sale of your share in the Rio
house...I've been extremely busy getting my immigration status in order and
setting up my company in London.

I've also asked Price Waterhouse to update all the accounts of Swanswalk Ltd
in Ireland (the company that owns the house) and see the best way forward
for a potential transaction seeking to minimize Brazilian and Irish taxes.

My personal matters should take me a few more weeks and I will contact you
to discuss the house shortly thereafter.

Regards,

Diomedes.

Dear Jeff,

Life is always full of surprises.  I feel very lucky to have had the
chance to know and appreciate you for who you are instead of for who
people think you are.  Another turn in your life will be nothing less
than another opportunity to continue to achieve all your goals.  This
transition will be understood by your friends and family who will
continue to support you.

Very friendly yours,
William

"The Morning Market Call - Tuesday September 25th, 2001.","
			Good Tuesday Morning - Comments From The Local Guys!

If the market has indeed put in a bottom over the last few days, be prepared
for us to 'retest' the lows. A successful test, is what is needed, followed
by a meaningful rally!
The market has already factored in most of the bad news from corporate
America. We may also see individual stocks rise after releasing bad news.
This would also prove to be very meaningful. Look to use this period to
upgrade portfolios.


The 30 -year bond yield is 5.57%.
The 10-year is trading at 4.70%.
The 5-year is trading at 3.81%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $21.81 p/b.
Natural Gas - Henry Hub -  is trading at $2.30 p/mcf after having dipped
below $2.00 earlier.

			Lehman's Research.

Banks  Henry Chip Dickson
Impact of Recession on Bank Trends (CD)
q Many expect that the precarious U.S. slowdown may already be in or tipping
toward recession after
the recent WTC incident. Regardless of whether the U.S. economy slips into
recession, it has been
undergoing a transition from rapid growth of the 1990s to a period of slow
growth. This transition
has created a challenging operating environment for banks.
q This week we take a look at historical bank trends before, during, and
after recessions.

Banks 		Jason Goldberg
Weekly Bank Facts (JG)
q The Lehman Brothers Bank Index ended the week down 7.2%. Our Large-Cap
Bank Index fell
11.2%, while the Mid-Cap Bank Index declined 6.7%.
q All major indices also were down this week. The S&P 500 fell 11.6%. The
Dow lost 14.3% and Nasdaq
was off by 16.0% for the week.

City National		 Brock Vandervliet
On Target With an Even Better Valuation 1 - Strong Buy / 39.85 (USD)
q Although the stock is still roughly 10% above where we upgraded it to
1-Strong Buy back in March,
it has retraced most of its intervening gains. Once again, we believe it
should be front and center
in any discussion with investors in the smaller-cap financials at this time.
q We carry a Q3 EPS estimate of $0.73 for CYN, expected to report October
12. Although confident in our
estimate this is $0.02 less than consensus.
q Given CYN's mildly asset sensitive positioning, we wouldn't be surprised
by some margin decline this
quarter, similar in magnitude to Q2.
q Due to the declining runoff of the non-relationship syndicated book, we
believe CYN's above average loan
growth should be increasingly visible


Commerce Bancorp		 Brock Vandervliet
Q3 Preview and Mtg On Manhattan Rollout 2 - Buy / $65.50 (USD)
q Although sharply below its highs along with so many other stocks, CBH
trades at a six multiple
premium to the rest of the group and we are maintaining our investment
rating of 2-Buy.
q We carry a Q3 estimate of $0.77, up $0.03 from Q2. CBH should report
October 10.
q We remain pretty confident in our numbers for several reasons. First, the
NIM, which was up 16 bps in Q2
to 4.81% should push higher still. Second, and perhaps more important from
the perspective of '02, CBH
is far less dependent than most banks on incremental loan growth.

Commerce Bancshares	 Brock Vandervliet
3Q Preview 2 - Buy / 35.99 (USD)
q Based on the likelihood of continued margin compression for the balance of
the year we are
trimming our estimates for the second half of 2001. Due to valuation we rate
the shares 2 - Buy
q We believe there is a chance CBSH could better our revised 2001 estimates
due to the quasi-non-recurring
items including branch sale and student loan securitization gains. CBSH
typically sells a portfolio
of student loans twice a year depending on supply and market conditions.
q We believe CBSH continues to repurchase shares at essentially the same
pace of 450,000 shares/quarter.

First Commonwealth Fin'l	 Brock Vandervliet
FCF 3Q Preview: Watching the Margin 3 - Market Perform / $10.85 (USD)
q Save the possibility of a sharp margin decline, which we view as unlikely
from this level, or
dramatically higher credit costs, we are confident in full year estimates of
$0.84 and $0.90 which
imply 7% EPS growth. FCF is rated 3-Market Perform.
q We carry a $0.21 Q3 EPS estimate, in line with Q2 and consensus as well.
We expect FCF will report
October 18. As with Q2, this is inclusive of what may be a penny or two of
investment securities gains.
q We have been concerned for sometime in the margin dynamic as Q2's NIM of
3.44% was an all time low
after falling 11 bps in the qtr. We believe it could fall somewhat further
although balance sheet trends
appear to be reasonably positive.

First Tennessee 	Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Further Upside Doable 2 - Buy / $34.03 (USD)
q We continue to be positive on our outlook for FTN and rate the stock
2-Buy. Not only lower interest
rates, but fundamental improvements within this organization should aid
results.
q Earlier in the quarter FTN announced it expects to post 3Q01 EPS of at
least $0.62. Our forecast pencils
out to $0.63. The company should report on October 17.
q We expect results to evidence continued strength in the net interest
margin and growth in both mortgage
banking and capital markets revenues. Asset quality metrics should remain
relatively stable.


Provident Financial Group 	Jason Goldberg
3Q 01 Keeping an Eye on Asset Quality 2 - Buy / $24.90 (USD)
q ? We rate PFGI 2-Buy and expect the company to put down EPS growth rates
ahead of its peers
once current issues are put to bed. However, we believe the next few
quarters could be bumpy and
that PFGI's business model, which is heavily exposed to commercial loans, is
more susceptible to
downturns in the economy.
q We expect PFGI to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.70 on October 17. This compares to
$0.63 in the prior quarter.
q While continued loan growth and fee income expansion should lead to
double-digit revenue growth, higher
credit costs and the lack of net interest margin expansion should restrain
further improvement.


Synovus Financial 	Jason Goldberg
3Q01 Preview: Keeping an Eye on TSYS 2 - Buy / $40.78 (USD)
q We rate SNV 2 Buy. SNV should benefit from its decentralized banking
approach in the Southeast,
the build-out of its wealth management unit and the growing contribution of
Total Systems.
q We expect SNV to report 3Q01 EPS of $0.27 on October 17.
q Continued net interest margin expansion and solid loan growth should lead
the bank's results.
q We will keep a close eye on TSYS, its 80.8% card processing unit, to see
if new business related to its
European rollout is enough to offset weaker than expected volume in
mid-September. TSYS should report
on October 16.
q We expect SNV to remain one of the few banks posting an ROE in the 20.00%
area and a ROA in the
2.00% range.

Ace Limited 		J. Paul Newsome
Upgraded to 1 Buy; Estimates Lowered 1 - Strong Buy / 23.71 (USD)
q We are upgrading ACE to 1-Strong Buy from 2-Buy with a $30 per share price
target. Among the
large cap. insurers ACE's stock is one of the most inexpensive and it has
among the most upside
to better prices in the future in commercial insurance and reinsurance.
q The stock is trading at about book value under what we feel would be a
worst-case scenario (double ACE
management's projected WTC loss). Historically ACE has traded at 150% of
book value.
q Our price target assumes the company trades at roughly a 40% discount from
its historic price-to-book
value one year from now.

Allmerica Financial J. Paul Newsome
Change of Recommendation 1 - Strong Buy / 45.04 (USD)
q We are upgrading Allmerica to 1 Strong Buy from 2 Buy following the
decline in its share price after
the World Trade Center disaster. Our new price target is $54 per share, down
from $65 per share.
q Allmerica, as a relatively large regional insurer, represents one of the
better ""safe havens"" among the
insurers largely unaffected by the World Trade Center disaster-little World
Trade Center loss exposure,
little investments in equities, and strong balance sheets.
q At just 87% of projected third quarter book value ($48.14 per share), we
think Allmerica represents
compelling value.

HCC Insurance Hldgs	 J. Paul Newsome
Rating Affirmed 1 - Strong Buy / $23.95 (USD)
q We are maintaining our 1 Strong Buy rating on HCC Insurance Holdings with
a price target of $27
per share, down from $30 per share.
q HCC Insurance Holdings falls nicely into the category of commercial
insurers well poised to take
advantage of the accelerating insurance prices following the tragic World
Trade Center disaster.

Countrywide Credit	 Makiko Coakley
CCR Will Report Its 2Q Earnings Tomorrow 2 - Buy / $40.21 (USD)
q Countrywide will report its fiscal 2Q earnings (for the quarter ending
August 30) on Tuesday 9/25.
The current consensus estimate for its 2Q is $1.19. We are raising our
estimate from $1.18 to
$1.20. Due to the fact that CCR typically benefits from lower interest
rates, and that it has very
limited credit risk exposure, the stock seems to be working as a ""place to
hide."" We believe this
trend will likely continue as long as the equity market remains volatile and
depressed.
q Mortgage rates declined and refinance activities picked up in Jul. and
Aug. CCR recently reported its
August production volume, which was the highest monthly number in CCR's
history. Thus, we are raising
our 2Q EPS estimate by $0.02 to $1.20.

Paychex Inc	 Adam Waldo
In-Line Qtr-Slight F2002 Guidance Reduc. 2 - Buy / $29.64 (USD)
q Reflecting F1Q02 results and new F2002 guidance, our DCF model shows the
current $30 share
price assumes a far too pessimistic low-teens EPS growth rate over the next
five years relative to
our 19% projection and management's 25% target. We would actively put new
money to work in
this blue chip Business & Professional Services company.
q On September 20, PAYX reported F1Q02 (ended August) EPS of $0.19 up 20%
year over year and in-line
with our estimates and the Street consensus.

Adept Technology 	Edward White
Insight into Photonics Area 2 - Buy / 4.25 (USD)
q While fundamentals in all of the company's served markets are particularly
weak, we believe the
company's position in photonics assembly automation supports purchase of the
shares for long-term
risk-oriented investors.
q Recently, we attended a presentation by Adept Technology, highlighting the
company's capabilities in
photonics assembly automation. We believe the key takeaway is that the
company's strategy of designing
and developing platforms is progressing well.
q We believe a critical differentiating factor for Adept in the photonics
market is the company's software
simulation capability, which has been critical to the co's initial successes
with customers, but is not
currently appreciated by investors.

JDS Uniphase A	Arnab Chanda
Preannounces; Remain Cautious 3 - Market Perform / 5.36 (USD)
q We continue to be cautious on JDS Uniphase and would look for entry points
once carrier capex
stabilizes.
q As we expected, JDS lowered its FQ1 rev forecast to $325M (down 46% q/q)
vs our previous forecast of
$400M (down 33% q/q). Although the company is seeing early signs of
stabilization in demand, we
continue to believe that margin compression could be a bigger issue due to
pricing.
q We are reducing CY01 revs from $2,281M (down 20% y/y) to $2,155M (down 24%
y/y) and CY02 from
$1,588M (down 30% y/y) to 1,356M (down 37% y/y). We believe gross margins
will continue to decline and
are modeling 38% in FQ1 and 36% in FQ2. We are also reducing FQ1 EPS from
($0.02) to ($0.03), CY01
EPS from $0.13 to $0.11, and CY02 EPS from $0.07 to $0.02



National Semiconductor
Shareholder Mtg.-FQ2 Guidance Reaffirmed 3 - Market Perform / $22.50 (USD)
q NSM hosted a shareholder meeting on Fri., reiterating FQ2 guidance of revs
up 5-7% q/q. Although
the company made positive comments on recent order activity, NSM was
uncertain about the near-term
prospects for end demand. This view is in-line with our concerns.
q National indicated that its turns business has remained healthy through
last week. The company is seeing
relative strength particularly in wireless (25% of revs) and displays (10%
of revs). Similarly to our view,
however, NSM is uncertain about the implications for real end demand given
the weakening economy and
this month's tragic events

"Speaker invitation to Economist Conference 24-25 October","Dear Mr Skilling

Following the success of our three previous annual conferences on the e-business and technology sector, the Economist Conferences is delighted to announce that we are now planning our fourth annual event Creating Value with Internet Technologies,  to take place in London in October of this year. We would very much like to invite you to deliver a keynote address at this event.

Now that spending on IT and systems is once again being evaluated in terms of productivity gains and returns on investment, companies are refocusing their efforts towards cost savings and efficiencies. As companies integrate the Internet into their supply chains, they frequently find that they need to change much more than their communications technology. Their strategy, their approach, their deployment of skilled people, their divisional structure - all these things get challenged.

We would very much like to hear your perspective on the potential for the e-marketplace, but, at this stage, I would also be happy to hear your suggestions.

The project is still in the early stages but we would like to secure our key speakers as early as possible. I am sure your diary will be very busy but we feel it would be of great value to have you there. Please find attached a draft outline of the event, and some further information about the Economist Conferences.
I do hope you will be able to consider our invitation, as your participation would certainly help to ensure that we offer an excellent programme and further add value to this annual gathering. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me on one of the numbers below.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit

---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"Re: [smu-betas] hot Dog 2","
Space,
 
I saw my fellow Arkie, Dent, at a book  signing in downtown Houston during ""The Junction Boys"" tour. When are you  coming back to H-town for the new book, Jim? Can I buy you a  refreshment?
 
By the way, Dent is not the only author in our  ranks. Written under the pen name, SmackNabb, I have a Beta  big brother who is  going throughout Texas hawking his new book, ""The Complete Infidel's Guide to  Radical Islam"". 
 
 If your local bookstore is out of stock, buy  Dent's book.

Oh  by the way Mr. Dent is doing a great job hocking his book up here in  Oklahoma.  Yesterday I heard him on talk radio KTOK where he was signing  books and predicting Oklahoma to beat Tulsa 106 to 0.  He didn't miss it  by much.

At Homecoming 2000, the BETA TENT had  the biggest crowd by far.  Stay connected and consider a future  homecoming BETA reunion.  It's incredible...forget the 20 years in  between...everyone just seems to pick it up right where they left off years  ago.

We met at moderators training in Dallas. I saw the announcement that you stepped

"RE:","I am sure that you have forwarded this email to a more senior Michael Brown, however, I would be glad to pledge to Jeff's ride this weekend.  You see, last fall my daughter died of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), she was nine months old and if they find a cure for MS, the cure for SMA will not be far behind as they are simular deseases.

So I would like to pledge $500 towards the ride in honor of my daughter, Hayden.  All I ask is that when the ride gets really hard, to think of her & all the others like her that will benefit from this ride, then peddle little harder.

You can send someone to pick up my check as I am located @ EB 3108F.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

"RE: Telephone Call with Jerry Murdock","Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

"Economist Interviews","
Jeff Skilling
Mike McConnell
Greg Piper
John Arnold

Thank you for agreeing to interview with Vijay Vaitheeswaran of the Economist on Tuesday.  Mike is scheduled for 12:30, Jeff for 2 p.m., Greg for 3 p.m. and John for 4 p.m.

Vijay is working on a story about old economy companies embracing the Internet.  He'll be testing the idea put forward by Erik Brynjolfsson of MIT that companies profiting most from the Internet are ones with a culture of openness.  As background, he has secured an advance copy of a new Harvard Business School case on EnronOnline, which basically outlines the advent of EOL.  It's a story that you all know well, and so you should not be disadvantaged if you don't have a copy of the study. (I can give you one if you want it.)

Specifically, he'll be probing:
How did the company begin to think about using the Internet?  Have our views altered?
What role models did we use?
What changes have worked best and why?
How far has success been dependent on changing corporate culture? Has it gone far enough?
What has been the impact on staffing?  Do we have the right people to do what needs to be done?
Has the Internet made -- or will it make -- substantial cost savings?  What is the scale of investment needed?
Will the Internet change the way we work with suppliers/distributors (where applicable).

Other companies on the list to be interviewed include GE, 7-Eleven, Siemens, Merrill Lynch, Cemex and Valeo.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Otherwise, I'll see you in the afternoon.

Vance Meyer

"QUICK NOTE ABOUT PARKING","Sorry to bother you with another note, but I've received so much reaction to my Tully parking notice, I'm writing again to tell you not to be concerned about being locked out of the Stadium if you're riding the bus back.  Some people think they're not going to get in by 11:00, and are concerned about not being able to get their cars out.  The last bus leaves Austin at 7 pm, and that would certainly get you there by 11:00, but if it doesn't for some reason, they're not going to lock the stadium until the last bus has dropped of its passengers.

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

"29th Floor Meeting Feedback","Hi Jeff, 
Thanks for speaking last Wednesday on 29, it was my first floor meeting with you and I found it informative.  I like your informal, ""no bones about it"" style, a style I wish more people would adopt.

During the meeting you had made some references about your previous guest which concerned me.  As an employee and shareholder in Enron, it occurred to me that some of the comments would not benefit Enron if they were ever leaked out to the press, (ie. like the Houston Chronicle article on the PRC process).

I do have one question to ask, with your light hearted comment about ""Air India""; In order to achieve the vision of being the ""World's Leading Company"" do you anticipate we will further develop business activities within existing areas, or do you anticipate Enron becoming involved in entirely new business areas?  In other words, do you see us building new businesses which represent a natural evolution of our current activities, or do you anticipate something more radical?  A couple of months ago you said in an interview that you will continue running the company, in a business as usual fashion, will that change?


Thanks for taking the time to speak with us.

"Enron Principal Investments - Organizational Memo","
Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

We are also very comforted when seeing American's determination, strength and confidence in the future.

Sophia Antipolis - September 11, 2001

Net-atHome2001: an invaluable opportunity

A lot happened during this supposed quiet summer period...
Things are going so well that almost no sponsorship opportunities remain after Siemens, HomeRF, DS2, Wrap/Merloni, Konnex and MetaVector Technologies recently joined the pool of event sponsors.
Space at the exhibition is selling out fast and the highly interactive strategic conference is set to be the event of the year in Europe for all industry professionals (<http://www.net-athome.com/menu7.htm>): the event has already attracted enormous interest from the market leaders in this sector and 3 months prior to the beginning of this exceptional week, over 110 people already signed-up.
In November, over 300 attendees are expected to come for what will undoubtedly be the largest event in the field of Home Networks & Gateways, Connected Appliances and Internet Services in Europe.

#####

Thank you for the time you have taken to go through this message. Please do not hesitate to contact us for any further information you would need.

Register now and sleep soundly?
For those who did not register yet, please note that facing the fast-growing success of the event, we have only a few hotel rooms left to offer to non partner attendees. It is thus obvious that the quicker you will register the greater your chances to benefit from two free nights at the M?ridien Hotel will be. Register now and save money to visit Nice !

"Online application issues","Jeff,

I have been researching Enron and understand some of the difficulties with
running global applications.
Many companies have problems with database replication over a wide area
network.  Traditional database replication is great for local area
replication within one data center.  Once you scale to multiple data
centers, traditional replication is unreliable, complicated to set up and
manage, and very expensive.

Zembu's software was designed to address this exact problem.  Our data
replication and synchronization solution can be used with 2 to n
geographically dispersed data centers.  Zembu also alleviates problems with:

-Global application performance
-Real time data sharing among multiple data centers
-24/7/365 application availability
-Cost effective scaling

Zembu can be used for unique log on applications, internal and/or external
applications.

I like to talk with someone at Enron to see if using Zembu as part of your
e-infrastructure and architecture would be beneficial to you.  We can
determine this quickly via a brief conference call.  Who should I speak
with?

Sincerely,
Fran Compagno

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to

to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his

he must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level

what I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the ""truth"").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a ""special"" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

"Alamo Challenge!!!","Hi there!  Just wanted to update you on the Alamo Challenge.  The ride is on October 13 & 14.  Bill Wilson, who is part of the Motorcycle Support Team, informed the club today that this may very well be the last Alamo Challenge ride.  The American Lung Association is thinking about revamping the ride with a new name and new route (nowhere near San Antonio).

REGISTRATION DEADLINE is October 1.  Please make sure to turn in your registration form along with your pledges to me before then.  This is a cycling club sponsored ride.  The Matching Gift form for your pledges can be found online now at http://home.enron.com/cr.  Matching Gift checks are cut on a quarterly basis, so get your form in before October 1 so that it can be cut on time.

JERSEYS
The American Lung Association has made some really nice jerseys for the ride this year.  You can view it at their website www.alamochallenge.com.  The jersey is going for $45, but ALA has cut the cycling club a deal and will let us have them for $35-$40.  Sizes are M - 4X.  They run bigger than the enron jerseys.  Please let me know if you're interested in purchasing a jersey.

PLEASE GET YOUR REGISTRATION FORM TO ME BY OCTOBER 1.

"Life Insurance Premium Payment","Mark,

You are a couple of days ahead of me.  You have a good tickler file.

First, may I  offer my  congratulations on your recent marriage.  You moved to Turkey to write - now you have someone to share your life experiences.  Life is good.

I am doing great.  The market appears to have bottomed out is now ""ratcheting up"".  And yes- our new president is headed in the right direction with his tax cut and especially his energy policy.  If we can just keep the Governor of California from going too far out into left field and people realize  what we have today was a result of the ""past"" president.

Speaking of field,  I went to Enron Field last night.  Fantastic baseball stadium.  A must on your travel list. I'm sure someone else you may know  also feels the same way.

Yes, it's premium time again.  Jeff made a $15,000 Gift to the Trust on 5/2/01 - Send Crummy Letter after this date. I told Jeff when he made the gift, I would be contacting you to make the premium payment at the end of the month

I will e-mail you on 5/30/01 the exact amount your are responsible to pay.  As last year, I will e-mail a Word attachment you can sign and fax back to me.  I then will ensure premiums are paid by both parties.

Thanks,

Keith

"Houston Chronicle interview","
Hi Jeff:

I'd love to sit down and talk with you in more detail about your decision to
leave Enron. If at any point you feel comfortable talking about it, how
about doing so in the Chronicle?

I'm sure you're aware of the speculation and rumors out there and how that's
hurting the stock. Talking to me would be an opportunity for you to stop the
negative chatter.

Aside from that, I think there's a genuine interest in the community in your
decision. I'm sure there are plenty of executives at other companies who
would love to read to about it, and wish they had the guts to do what you
did.

End of pitch.

Laura

"The First Year on PBS","
Dear Friend,
 
I hope that this letter finds you in good spirits and health, and that you've returned from your summer refreshed.  One of the highlights of my summer is watching ""The First Year,"" a new documentary by Davis Guggenheim.  I was profoundly touched by this film, and want to encourage you to watch it, as it will be broadcast by PBS throughout the country over the next few days.
 
""The First Year"" follows five young people through their rookie year of teaching in the Los Angeles public school system.  The film draws the viewer in by weaving together personal and incredibly human stories of novice teachers trying to connect with and nurture their students.  ""The First Year"" is a truly moving portrait of our nation's schools; I guarantee that it will inspire both hope and outrage.
 
The show airs this Wednesday, September 5 at 7:30pm on WGBX in the Boston area, and premieres on PBS in most other cities on September 6 at 9pm.
 
The attached file has the air dates for most major markets, for example:
In New York on September 7 at 9pm
In Boston on September 5 at 7:30 pm
In San Francisco and Los Angeles on Sept 6 at 9pm
 
http://www.pbs.org/firstyear
 
I sincerely hope that you will watch ""The First Year.""  I guarantee that it won't be a waste of your valuable time.
 
Many thanks and best regards!
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Li Lu

"GridSouth appointment","Hi everyone-- greetings to all. I hope you are well and enjoying your
summer!  I wanted to let you know that the process is complete and my
appointment to the corporate board of directors for GridSouth Transco, LLC
is confirmed.  GST is a new regional transmission organization, formed under
the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Order 2000, which encourages
creation of larger electric power market areas in the U.S.  GST will operate
the transmission assets of Duke Energy, Carolina Power & Light (Progress
Energy) and SCANA (South Carolina Electric & Gas), with 22,000 miles of
transmission lines connected to approximately 34,500 megawatts of electric
generation serving more than 3.75 million customers in North Carolina and
South Carolina.  This appointment is in addition to and apart from my duties
here at the Institute, but a great opportunity for us to get a good look at
how the electric power industry is being re-shaped.  The board begins
operation next September.  For more information about GridSouth, you can

Beek,  thanks for the update.  There will be a little more -kai- in Atlanta this weekend as Woody Berry, Adam Berry, maybe Joe Berry join John Grumbles, Mark Hillstrom and his son Ryan, for some sort of golf tournament (I really think it's all about the beer and the -kia-!!).

"Extension of Series C Offering and Waiver of Right to Participate","
June 29, 2001

Dear Questia Stockholder:

As a follow-up to our Series C stock offering, I would like to inform you
that the participation in our Series C offering has been slower than
anticipated.  We had originally intended to raise $15MM to $20MM dollars.
To date we have raised approximately $11MM although we are expecting to
hear from several Taiwanese investors about a substantial investment that
will be incremental to the $11MM that has been raised to date.

Additionally, we have recently retained Credit Suisse First Boston to
assist us with a $25MM private placement with a strategic partner.  We are
optimistic that this round will close in mid to late September 2001.

You may recall that the Series C documents provided for us to close the
Series C round on May 31, 2001.  Questia would like to extend that period
to permit additional Series C investors to participate in the Series C
round on the same terms and conditions as the Series C investors who
participated prior to May 31, 2001.

In order to facilitate this extension, I ask that you sign the attached
waiver and return it to me by fax at 713-358-2996.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

J. David Cabello
Vice President and General Counsel

"EBV's Grand Slam Event - Thanks","I wanted to thank each of you for participating in the venture group's ""Grand Slam"" event this week.  It was a big success.  We received very positive feedback from the attendees.  One of our primary objectives was to provide our portfolio companies with further insight into EBS' strategy/business model, and each of your presentations was a key part of telling the Enron/EBS story.  In order for the portfolio companies to develop products that are strategic to EBS, it is imperative that they fully understand our business model.  I know everybody's schedule is very busy, so we appreciate you taking the time.

"A trip to Turkey","Jeff,
I am headed to Istanbul & the Greek Isles for vacation in late June.  I happened to be talking with Rebecca who indicated that you guys had just gotten back from Istanbul for a wedding & that you have a brother that lives there.  We will be in Istanbul for only 3 days & want to make the best use of time possible.  I think that Rebecca mentioned that you knew of a private guide that we might be able to book for full or half days.  I would love to do that & wondered if you might have the name & phone number of the guide.  Also, I would love to hear your thoughts on what there is to do & if you have any restaurant recomendations.  We are staying at the same hotel that you & Rebecca just stayed at & it will be the first time in Istanbul for both of us.  Jeff, thanks in advance for your insight & help!!!

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity,
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr.
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for
Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet
with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

"Hawkes Peers & Co.","
Hello Jeff,

Regardless of the present state of Wall Street and the rest of the US
economy, the choke point in business growth today is-and will continue to
be--talent rather than capital.

Hawkes-Peers & Co. is an executive search firm based in NYC. What
characterizes our candidates is their current and recent experiences. We
specialize in identifying opportunities for top-tier consultants from the
premier strategy firms--McKinsey, Bain, BCG, AT Kearney, and Booz Allen--who
have either rolled out into industry or are looking to move into the
corporate sector. These candidates also share the qualification of an MBA
from one of the elite business schools: Harvard, Wharton, Sloan, Stanford,
or Kellogg.

We target this group of individuals on an ongoing basis, maintaining an
active dialogue with them, so we know exactly whom to identify for
appropriate opportunities. Our network allows your organization to be highly
selective while saving invaluable time. You pick and choose among the most
talented strategic, operations, and management consulting professionals;
they build the future strength of your company.

If you have an interest in the pool of talent we represent, I would be happy
to provide you with more information. I can also send samples of our past
introductions as well as resumes provided with the candidates' permission.
Please let us know if there's any way we can help you.

I thought you might find this some useful background to our progress.

All the numbers tie-back to the ones you have used publically - these are the internal 'gross' numbers (we eliminated all the internal Enron deals/counterparties for external purposes).

 

Call me if you have any questions.

"E Speak","


Jeff, I noticed one of your questions on E Speak today concerned the disposal of waste food from the Energizer.  Coincidentally one of our companies, Custom Feeds, is negotiating with Marriott for the right to collect all of the waste food from their various corporate facilities for processing into animal feed.  This is probably a better solution than giving the food to the homeless since it may not be deemed safe for consumption by health authorities after setting out at room temperature. 

Also regarding Custom Feeds they just signed a 3 year contract to sell 95% of their capacity to a large agricultural feed wholesaler beginning with Custom Feeds first production runs.  This will put Custom Feeds ahead of the projections on which we based the investment.

Enron's Power Crisis

""Bizarre"" is how everyone describes it. On Aug. 14, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling--a self-described ""brilliant"" 47-year-old who says he's never suffered any kind of failure--announced he was relinquishing his title and leaving the company after a mere six months in the top job. Skilling insisted that the parting was voluntary, laying the blame on unspecified personal, non-health-related reasons. But by leaving when and how he did, Skilling forfeited a roughly $20 million severance package and gained the responsibility of repaying a $2 million loan that Enron would have forgiven had he stuck around until the end of the year. 
More bizarre than his timing is how quickly Enron's once tight relationship with Wall Street deteriorated during Skilling's reign. The ex-CEO was famously boastful--insisting that Enron's nascent broadband trading business was worth $35 billion--and thin-skinned, declaring on a conference call that a money manager who dared ask for a balance sheet was an ""asshole.""
The task of restoring Enron's glory falls to Ken Lay, the company's chairman and former CEO, who has replaced Skilling. He's got his work cut out. Enron's ""overall quality of earnings has deteriorated, its level of behind-the-scenes financial engineering has increased, and its overall standing with the Street has plunged,"" wrote UBS Warburg analyst Ron Barone in a recent report--and Barone is one of the bulls. Despite Lay's insistence that there aren't any ""accounting issues, trading issues, or reserve issues"" at Enron, investors are hesitant to bid the company back up. Indeed, Enron now trades at around $38, down some 60% from its 52-week high. 
One reason Lay's job is so tough is that, as FORTUNE pointed out in March (see ""Is Enron Overpriced?"" on fortune.com), Enron's financials are on the dim side of opaque. While Wall Street was once willing to take the company's word on financial performance, it no longer is. And because Enron gives analysts so little to work with, building independent models is next to impossible. Enron's major business, the trading and marketing of energy, is relatively new and extremely complicated. Seemingly basic questions--like the effects of lower natural gas prices and less volatility in the energy markets on Enron's profits--are still unanswered. And there's confusion about the relationship between Enron's reported earnings, which reflect changes in the value of its energy-trading portfolio, and the actual cash coming in. In the first half of the year, Enron reported net income of $810 million and cash flow from operations of negative $1.3 billion. 
Then there's the challenge of convincing investors that Enron itself believes it has a rosy future. High-level executives besides Skilling have recently left, and analysts like Jeff Dietert at Simmons say insider selling has been ""aggressive"" recently. While Enron executives still hold big chunks of stock, according to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics, insiders have sold 1.75 million shares in 2001--and they've sold as the stock has fallen, which is generally regarded as a bad sign. Among the biggest sellers: Lay, who has sold 408,000 shares at prices ranging from $81 last winter to $43 in July. Other sellers have included two executives who have since resigned: new business unit head Lou Pai and broadband chief Kenneth Rice. Enron says that sales are related to the pending expiration of options. 
Lay is moving swiftly to address those concerns. He's promised the Street more disclosure about Enron's operations, and to combat criticism about Enron's weak bench he recently announced a new office of the chairman, anointing veterans Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert to help him run the company. No word yet on whether he plans to start buying Enron stock. 
Quote: Wall Street will no longer take the company's word on financial performance.

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

Enron Offers to Complete Indian Power Plant If Govt Backs Sale

     Mumbai, Sept. 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. said it will
finish building a $3 billion power plant in India if the
government backs a plan by the biggest energy trader to sell its
majority stake in the unprofitable venture to local banks.

     Work stopped in June on the second construction phase of the
power station in Maharashtra state because the plant's sole
customer, the state electricity board, owes $64 million in unpaid
bills and ceased buying power in May. The expansion, which is 95
percent complete, would add 1,444 megawatts of capacity.

     Enron offered to sell its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power
Co., the plant's owner, in three tranches to local banks that
helped finance the project, Business Standard reported, citing a
letter to India's Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee from Enron.

     ``We are willing to complete the project at cost should they
(government) proceed with our plan,'' said Jimmy Mogal, a
spokesman for Dabhol Power Co., Enron's local unit.

     Enron would sell 40 percent of its shares in Dabhol once
negotiations with construction operators to finish the work begin.
It would sell a further 50 percent of its stake once construction
restarts in April 2002. The rest would be sold when the project is
completed by January 2003, the paper said.

     Contractors stopped work on the expansion in June because
they hadn't been paid since April.

    Indian banks loaned $1.4 billion to Dabhol without government
guarantees on the loans. The $600 million lent by ABN Amro, Bank
of America Corp. and other overseas banks is covered by government
guarantees.

     Indian lenders would have to disburse about $320 million for
completion of project, which includes construction of a 5 million-
ton liquefied natural gas import and storage facility.



INDIA PRESS: Enron Proposes 3-Stage Sale Of Dabhol Stake

09/06/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) is proposing to sell the foreign equity in India's Dabhol Power Co. to Indian financial institutions through a three-part payment structure extending until Jan. 1, 2003, reports the Business Standard. 
Enron holds a 65.86% stake in DPC, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB, holds 14.14%, and Bechtel Corp. (X.BTL) and General Electric Co. (GE) each hold 10%.
Dabhol is a 2,184-megawatt power project in the western Indian state of Mahrashtra. 
Enron wants to sell its equity in DPC following payment disputes with its sole buyer, MSEB, and the federal government's failure to honor its counterguarantee. 
DPC's 1,444-megawatt phase II is about 95% complete. Its construction was abandoned by the contractor because of DPC's inability to pay. 
Under the structure, Enron has asked for initial payment of 40% of the purchase price of the entire foreign equity at the start of renegotiations between potential buyers and construction operators. 
The second installment of 50% has to be paid at the resumption of construction of the second phase of the project, or by April 1, 2002, whichever is earlier. The third and final installment of 10% has to be paid at the time of mechanical completion of the 2,144-MW power plant and regassification facility, or by Jan. 1, 2003, whichever is earlier, the report says. 
In a proposal submitted to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Enron has said in the event the federal government doesn't directly purchase the foreign equity, it should guarantee the payment obligation in full. 
The $2.9 billion Dabhol project has an equity component of $1 billion, with foreign players, including Enron, contributing $858.6 million. India's financial institutions have a total exposure of over 60 billion rupees ($1=INR47.16), the report says. 
The Indian financial institutions, currently preparing a plan for the project's early revival, are considering Enron's proposal, the report said.

More companies looking to hedge their exposure to volatile energy prices
By BRAD FOSS
AP Business Writer

09/06/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - Harrah's Entertainment Inc. is willing to bet on many things. The cost of energy isn't one of them. 
Stung by high electricity and natural gas prices last year, Harrah's is not taking any more chances when it comes to buying the power to keep its casino on the New Jersey shore as bright and noisy as the nearby boardwalk and as cool as an Atlantic breeze.
The company has since locked in long-term supply contracts at fixed prices with Houston-based Enron Corp., joining the growing legion of hotels, manufacturers, retailers and technology firms behaving more like utilities in terms of hedging their exposure to volatile energy prices. 
In January, Harrah's Atlantic City - 86,000 square feet of casino space and more than 1,100 hotel rooms - rang up a natural gas bill that topped $220,000, nearly quadruple what it normally pays during a winter month. 
Under the 7-year deal with Enron, Harrah's agreed to pay roughly $5 per 1,000 cubic feet for a certain amount of natural gas. 
""We wanted to put ourselves in a position where we could even the playing field and not worry about those price spikes,"" said Stuart Thomas, who oversees energy procurement at Harrah's. 
Last winter, the retail price soared above $10 per 1,000 cubic feet in many parts of the country, and as high as $19 per 1,000 cubic feet in New Jersey. 
At $5 per 1,000 cubic feet, Harrah's natural gas bill last January would have been closer to $60,000. 
While Harrah's will be buffered from the worst-case scenario next January, the company could miss out on some savings if natural gas prices dip below what they've agreed to pay Enron. Harrah's executives said that is a tradeoff they will accept. 
""We didn't do it to save money,"" said Thomas, emphasizing that Harrah's $40 million-a-year energy bill is a tiny fraction of its overall costs. ""We did it to manage risk."" 
Harrah's is not alone. Eli Lilly & Co., IBM Corp., Kraft Foods Inc., Saks Inc. and Solvay Polymers Inc. are just some of the companies that have energy management deals with Enron, Duke Energy Corp. and Reliant Resources Inc. 
Enron's energy services unit is head and shoulders above its closest rival in this emerging field, signing $40 billion in contracts since it was created in 1997. After $200 million in losses since 1998, it recorded its first profits of $100 million in profit in the first half of 2001. 
Jeremy Blachman, the division's chief operating officer, attributes the success to the breadth of its portfolio, which includes deals with food and beverage giant Quaker Oats Co. and the Archdiocese of Chicago, which signed a seven-year agreement worth nearly $250 million. 
""Over the last couple of years, and particularly the last 6 to 9 months, we have seen our business go across markets,"" Blachman said. 
A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Mike Heim said Enron's energy services unit, which is essentially a seller of electricity and natural gas at retail prices, remains but ""a blip"" within Enron, which gets 80 percent of its profit from wholesale marketing and trading. 
But if power and natural gas prices remain volatile, ""it has the potential to become 10 to 20 percent of their business down the line,"" Heim said. 
Makers of chemicals, fertilizer, glass and steel - some of the most energy-intensive industries in the United States - were hit the hardest in the past 18 months as natural gas and electricity soared to prices never seen before. 
Companies that were not protected with long-term contracts took it in the neck, said P.J. Juvekar, a senior chemicals analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. 
After Dow Chemical Co., which was protected, completed its purchase of Union Carbide Corp., which wasn't, Dow was hit with a first-quarter loss of $685 million, compared with a profit of $512 million a year earlier. 
""Most of the disappointment came from the Carbide side, where they were fully exposed to $10 (per 1,000 cubic feet) natural gas prices without any hedges,"" Juvekar said. 
Companies that were protected from last year's energy spikes recognized earlier on that ""we didn't feel as comfortable as the market deregulated,"" said Michael Thaman, chief financial officer of fiberglass giant Owens Corning, which needs massive quantities of natural gas and electricity to melt billions of pounds of glass each year. 
""We certainly don't have any illusions about our ability to beat the market,"" said Thaman, whose company signed a 10-year contract with Enron worth $1 billion. 
In the case of Harrah's, the most important thing was to rein in energy costs without skimping on amenities at the casino or hotel, said Bill Simpson, facilities manager at the Atlantic City property. 
Shutting down unused slot machines - 3,500 are on at all times - or adjusting the casino floor thermostat - set at a constant 70 degrees - were never considered last winter even as natural gas and electricity prices soared to record levels. Neither was passing along the costs to hotel guests by adding an energy surcharge on their bills, a strategy pursued by many hotel companies.

Enron still plans sale of Portland General
NEW YORK -- Enron Corp. said Wednesday it still plans to sell its Portland General utility in Oregon. 
Enron has been trying to sell the utility for more than a year. A $3.1 billion sale to Sierra Pacific Resources collapsed in April because the California power crisis made it too difficult to win approval, the companies had said. 
Enron is ""getting close to another transaction"" involving Portland General, Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay said at a Lehman Bros. energy conference in New York. 


Power regulators still debating decisions on key energy issues

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State power regulators were poised Thursday to suspend direct access, the option that allows Californians to choose their electricity provider. 
Though a mere 200,000 Californians switched from their local utility to companies such as Green Mountain Energy or Enron, the Legislature has ordered the Public Utilities Commission to temporarily end consumer choice to keep three struggling utilities from losing more customers.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. are each are on the hook for the more than $9.5 billion the state spent buying electricity on their customers' behalf this year. 
The PUC is expected to suspend direct access retroactively to July 1. Energy service providers, such as solar and wind-powered electricity seller Green Mountain Energy, say it's unconstitutional, and have vowed to fight the PUC in court. 
Likely to be missing from Thursday's meeting are several key issues that would affect Californians' electric bills: 
- A proposal to grant the state's power-buying agency the authority to raise electric rates on its own without PUC review to ensure such rates are justified. 
- A proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co. residential customers by an average of 12 percent. 
- A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co. $6.5 billion, Southern California Edison Co. $4 billion and SDG&E $1.5 billion to help the state recoup its power-buying costs. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission needs more time to review a flood of comments from utilities, consumer advocates and other parties to those decisions. 
The state plans to recover some of the money it has spent buying power by collecting a portion of ratepayer money. 
The more ratepayers each utility has, the lighter the blow to each customer's electric bill. But it would come at the expense of consumer choice, which lawmakers had promoted as the method by which deregulation would foster competition and lead to lower electric rates. 
Rick Counihan, vice president and general manager of Green Mountain Energy, said if the PUC suspends consumer choice until the state stops buying power for the utilities - potentially a decade down the road - consumer choice is dead. 
""(Direct access) was one of the few good things that came out of the restructuring,"" Counihan said. 
Just as some environmentally conscious customers buy organic produce or recycled paper products, the option to leave their utility and buy power largely generated by the wind or sun was another way they could make a difference, he said. 
Under the PUC plan, customers who signed up with an energy provider before July 1 could keep their contracts until they expire. Deals signed after that date would be nullified, and the customer would be forced to return to a local utility. 
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, a vocal proponent of direct access, is hopeful it could resume after the finances of PG&E, Edison and SDG&E improve. 
""When the utilities get back in the business - if they ever get back in the business of going out and buying electricity on behalf of themselves - that could open up direct access again,"" Bilas said. He predicted that could happen 18 months from now. 
Counihan was less optimistic. 
""I'm very skeptical that we, or other providers, will come back to California,"" Counihan said. ""We'll very likely take our marketing activities and reallocate to other states that are more friendly."" 
Counihan also worried a temporary suspension would give the big three utilities no incentive to retain an infrastructure of computers and other technology put into place to process customers who switched to the alternative energy firms.
