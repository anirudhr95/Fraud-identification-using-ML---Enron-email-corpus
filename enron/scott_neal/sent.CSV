Subject:	RE: Contract status needed

Bob, Attached for your review is a summary status report of the top ten pipelines identified by east trading as needing to be up and running as soon as possible for NETCO. Credit, contract, timing and legal requirements are included for review.  Most actions and requests are determined by who the parent company is and how the credit check turns up. That also greatly impacts the turnaround time for service  for us to transact on the pipelines.  I have all hardcopies of necessary forms on my desk.  We can perform the same inquiry and request for the next batch of pipelines that trading identifies as second tier and necessary for trading as we expand.   Please let me know if you need additional information.
THANKS

Subject:	Contract status needed

On Monday we have to file a ""transition plan"" with Louise Kitchen for NETCO. She wants details. On that note I need a status report from each desk on our effort to start the contract process for pipes, TPA's & EBB's so I can include that in the report. I have received some emails however I would like each manager to put together a summary in an Excel spreadsheet that we can have Suzanne consolidate with the stuff she already put together. Please cover the key items listed in the earlier email. Also we should be getting as much hard copy as possible so we can proceed with our goal of preparing for a startup. I suggest reviewing the paperwork and identify the stuff that you will need to get the forms completed. No doubt we will have substantial gaps but as long as we know where and what they are we can get the proper internal people involved (legal, credit, etc.)

Tks - Bob

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Nelson,

I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  

sitara #778201

also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.

Scott, As you know, Alex and Irena will be supporting Central in the new building .  That breaks up the support/sharing that occurs now when Kim is away from her desk.  I believe that the East needs Kim and 1 other full time to support our Admin needs.  That is in line with our budget.  I think that Ina was suggesting that we share with another group, which may undermine the service that we need.  Kim has suggested Daniel as a possible 2nd to her.  I believe that we should plan to bring Daniel on as a Temp when we get into the new building and then decide after a month or 2 as to what we want to do full time moving forward.  Any thoughts ?  yes ? no?

Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!

Intercepted Memo From Osama Bin Laden 
Here is a memo we have Intercepted from Osama Bin Laden to all of his
Cavemates. 


To: Cavemates

From: Bin Laden, Osama 

Sent: Monday, December 10, 2001 8:17 AM 

Subject: The Cave 

Hi guys. We've all been putting in long hours in this conflict but we've
finally come together as a group and I love that. Big thanks to Omar for
putting up the poster that says ""There is no I in team"" as well as the one
that says ""Hang In There, Baby."" That cat is hilarious. However, while we
are fighting a jihad, we can't forget to take care of the cave. And frankly
I have a few concerns. 
First of all, while it's good to be concerned about cruise missiles, we
should be even more concerned about the scorpions in our cave. Hey, you
don't want to be stung and neither do I, so we need to sweep the cave daily.

I've posted a sign-up sheet near the main cave opening. 
Second, it's not often I make a video address but when I do, I'm trying to
scare the most powerful country on earth, okay? That means that while we're
taping, please do not ride your razor scooter in the background. Just while
we're taping. Thanks. 
Third point, and this is a touchy one. As you know, by edict, we're not
supposed to shave our beards. But I need everyone to just think hygiene,
especially after mealtime. We're all in this together. 
Fourth: food. I bought a box of Cheez-Its recently, clearly wrote ""Osama"" on
the front, and put it on the top shelf. Today, my Cheez-Its were gone.
Consideration. That's all I'm saying. 
Finally, we've heard that there may be American soldiers in disguise trying
to infiltrate our ranks. I want to set up patrols to look for them. First
patrol will be Omar, Muhammed, Abdul, Akbar, and the new guy Richard. 

Love you lots. 

Osama B.

Attached is the file with Lavo's changes.

Please assign them and the assistants a desk.

We are out of time on turning this churn in.  I must have it by noon.  I will be meeting with the move team tomorrow afternoon to set move dates.  I'm being asked about  the trading simulation for next week and since your churns aren't set I can't provide an answer.

Ina, please pull in whomever you need to work on the churn,  be sure and get with Superty's asst to help you with those people etc.

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

worked with in the past.  If you know any good people in front, mid or back
office positions who may be interested in new job opportunities, feel free
to pass along my name or let me know how I can contact them.  Any referrals

Hey Scott
Realize the timing is terrible for a sit-down conversation.  But, I'm sitting on the 6th floor now in the new bldg now: 6193- and am guessing you're not far.  If you're around today and have time, let me know and I'll stop by to say hello.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 

List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 

In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 

Tks - Bob

Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in

Hi Lenny,

Don't know if you are involved in this area or not. I think maybe. Anyway, we have a refined lead contract with Hammond. The local buyer for Pottstown, PA is interested in getting information about natural gas for possible future use from ENRON. If you could contact him or direct him to the person that is in a position to help it would be appreciated.  His name is, Joe Stewartz E-MAIL address is jstewartz@hmndgroup.com
telephone number (610) 327-1400 Fax number (610) 327-1255

Thanking you in advance and hope all is well with you.

Regards,
Ron Brown

Scott,
I know/hope you don't hate me and please don't hate me after this,  but we have to do better job estimating our position.  Again we are over our limits.  Lavo is putting pressure on me to do a better job managing/estimating risk on the desk.  ""Stress"" is high and your help is greatly appreciated. 

Unfortunately, rating agencies are looking at VAR daily.  They believe we have an excellent handle on our risk.  It is critical that we temporary stay our course.  

Thanks for everything. I look forward to working with you on the other side.

Subject:	RE: BUG Rebooking

Maureen Smith and Ruth Concannon have raised some issues regarding how Brooklyn Union Gas is in the books, specifically, the final contract year (11/1/03 - 10/31/04) is not in the books at all (which will produce a gain when booked), and the current deal structure is telescoped incorrectly at Transco Zones 1,3, & 4 when it should be telescoped 17% at Zone 1, 25% at Zone 2, and 58% at Zone 3.  This will produce a slight loss when rebooked, but the gain from booking the final year is more than enough to offset the loss.  

The purpose of tomorrow is to review that issues and valuations with you & Frank before making any changes to the books.  Please let me know if you have any other questions.  Thanks!

I don't know if you are still in the market for people.  I have attached the resume of Vickie Versen
for your review.  She was most recently responsible for trading physical gas in the Gulf.  She came out of 
our scheduling/logistics group and has extensive experience working on several East pipes.  I think she would

Transco has been asked by several of its customers to 
address the dynamics of gas processing and its corresponding

Transco system.  In response, Transco will host a meeting in 
Houston from 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday,  October 17, 
2001 at the Williams Tower to bring together 
producer/operators, processing plant operators and local 
distribution companies.  

The meeting will be in a round-table discussion format to 
enable a wide-ranging, open dialogue among participants that 
are impacted by the dynamics of gas prices and processing 
margins. 

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 by Friday, 
October 12, 2001 so that the appropriate facilities can be

If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I appreciate it.

"RE: trading track candidate","Karen,

I had not thought about the title issue but my view is that if the person is a viable candidate and wants to pursue this track then title should be a non issue.  I don't see any problem with having a current manager in the program.  Having said all that, I don't know John Lavoratto's view.

Hi Scott,

Eric Boyt is back in town and we are following up with him on the Trading Track,   as he is a manager currently, he is concerned that this would be a step down.   From a salary perspecitve he is on a higher scale than that of the preent trading track individuals... we would have to take him into the trading track as a manager?   I am meeting with him today to discuss the TT in more detail.. you may want to touch base with him also on this if you have time.

Thanks, Karen.

Karen,

I spoke with Brian this morning and he has agreed with me that this financial obligation resides at the East desk, under Scott Neal.  It is also my understanding that when the joint venture was established that one of the deal components was that the East desk would absorb these contract positions.

As such,  I agree that the obligation should be processed and paid by Bryce's group.  If Scott or Bryce have any questions, they should meet with Brian Redmond.

Jean,
Bryce sent this message to Brian this morning.  If September and October are included, the amount is $700k.  My personal feeling is that the fact that no one wants to take the hit for this is irrelevant.  Contractually, Bridgeline is owed this money and the payments should have been processed by Bryce's group.

Please let me know your thoughts and if you have suggestions on how to proceed.
Thanks,
Karen

Subject:	Bridgeline Payments

Brian - Bridgeline is billing us $50,000/month for two contracts where ENA has not received consent to assignment from CES by the counterparty.  Apparently the contract with Bridgeline stipulated that until such time as the consent was received on these contracts, ENA would pay this fee.  The contracts are with LGS Natural Gas Company and Entergy New Orleans, Inc.  Kam Keiser (East Risk) has spoken to Scott Neal, and he doesn't believe that the East desk should take the hit for this fee.  Bridgeline is looking for their cash, and I don't want to pay this until we have a deal booked for it.  Do you know where this charge should be booked?  I estimate that we owe Bridgeline approximately $600,000, and need to pay it as soon as possible.  Thanks for your help with this.

Bryce

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

Fred Baloutch  -  recommendation: invite in for interview  -  excellent academic results, very smart, some summer gas experience with BC gas, did some work with weater derivatives,  very enthusiatic 

Carlos Betancourt  -  recommendation: do not invite for interview - unable to communicate relavent experience.

Seung ""Sam"" Hyun Cho -  recommendation:  invite for interview ( however, Sam does not graduate until May '02, so Associate program recruiting may be a better fit.)  excellent academic results,  able to discuss a wide variety of subject material regarding trading,  strong understanding of risk and derviatives.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

opportunities also.

Scott,

Just a quick note.  I believe you did a great job this afternoon in communicating with your group about Enron's ""cluster.""
Today I have found this overwhelming since of Pride for this company and I don't want it to fail.  So if there is ANYTHING I can do to help please let me know.  I am in for the challenge and the long haul.


Sincerely,
Sandra

I think it would be a good idea for us to have one shower for everybody.  So I will be taking donations, so I can buy the gifts this weekend.  The gifts will be for Craig, Vicki and Pete.  The shower will be Tuesday @ 4:00, Eb 32c2.

I want to pass on some work information for you to share with the members of your team please.
     
Enron has partnered with Ford to provide special discounts to Enron employees on top of the rebates and discounts that normally apply.    The plan is called the Ford X Plan.   

Here's how it works: 

To get this discount you need this partner Code XB981 or either call 877-975-2600 or go to https://www.fordpartner.com/index.asp and enter the required information. 

Name
Address
Company
SSN
Etc. 

Upon providing this information you will be given or sent a PIN number.  Then you can go to any Ford dealership, tell them your an XPlan member, give them the PIN and tell them what car you want - no negotiating no haggling.  Any rebates and discounted interest rates still apply to this price. 

Regards
Frank

Tanya,

This is a follow-up to my two calls this morning.  I have talked to Pat Ebert at Ashland.  I asked her why they refuse to pay their October 2001 invoices.  She said that her management wants to speak to someone in upper management at Enron.  I asked to speak to her manager and was told that she was in a meeting.  I asked her to get her out of the meeting.  She did not comply.  Her managers name is Sherry Tackett.  Her phone number is 614-790-6941.  I left her a messsage.  I told her that I expect payment for the ENA upstream, for 559,000+, and for ENA for 374,000+.  I also told her she received to commodity so the payment is due.  I told her  expect it today.  I left my phone number and told her to call me as soon as possible.

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference.

Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of ""If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control"" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is ""To put to rest""

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an ""excess
parachute payment,"" according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in

Subject:	RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

The Dow  topped out in February of 1966 at 995. By September of that year the Dow had  tumbled to 744. The Dow then rallied to a high of 943 in September of '67. By  March of '68 the Dow had fallen to 825, only to climb to a highly speculative  peak of 985 in December of '68. The Dow then sank to 631 in December of '70.  

By April of '71 the Dow had climbed back to 950, only to fall to 869 in  February of '72. A big rally then took the Dow (unconfirmed) to a record high of  1051 in January of '73, turning everyone bullish. But by December of '73 the Dow  had collapsed to 788. Think that was bad - by December of '74 the Dow had sunk  to a bear market low of 577. At that time, the gurus and geniuses of Wall Street  were predicting a 250 Dow and many were talking openly about the end of  capitalism. Of course, that was the bottom

And that's  the way the greatest bear market since the Depression worked its way down. By  late 1974 investors were dizzy, they were desperate, they were wrung-out, they  had left Wall Street, many for  good.

He would like to see the # of counterparties we did physical trades with in the year 2000 and the volumes by month (sales) in New Jersey.

There are two Notional curves (locations) that are in New Jersey.  IF-TETCO/M3 and TRANSCO/Z6NONNY.


I cannot find any old files from Nagesh but I just need to see the volumes for the year and the number of counterparties.  I don't need to see the counterparty names just the number of counterparties for the year.

Subject:	PDVSA Visit 5/24
Importance:	High

Hi Scott - 

Per my voice mail, we have another Enron South America visitor arriving at Enron on 5/24, PDVSA or Petroleum Venezuela.  Please let me know if you are available to deliver the same presentation you gave to Petrobras to PDVSA.  The time is 2:00 - 2:45 in 50MO3.

Objectives:	
Favorably respond to a request from PDVSA to educate them about the natural gas industry 
Impress PDVSA with Enron's professional staff and operations, i.e. Build familiarity and favorability of Enron

Background:
PDVSA is Enron's key strategic partner in Venezuela.  For PDVSA, this visit represents a major opportunity for them to learn about the business of an industry that they are only now beginning to develop.  Until recently, PDVSA was limited to the petroleum until the new formation of their gas unit.
PDVSA (Petroleum of Venezuela) is the largest and most important company in Venezuela.  
It is one of the most important energy corporations in the world.
It is a national corporation that establishes tight direct links with foreign energy companies as well as with the Minister of Energy and the government of Venezuela.  
They are an enterprise that is multidisciplinary within the energy market.  It comprises in area of trade, refining, exploration and production.  (In particular: gas, emissions, petroleum, carbon, petrochemicals, lubricants, fertilizers, and combustion.)
PDVSA is owner of many important companies like Citgo, Veba Oil, Refinery Isla, Borco, Bopec, and many others.
Due to the importance of globalization within the energy market, there are many agreements with PDVSA and foreign companies.

PDVSA Relationship with Enron Venezuela

Enron Venezuela has two strategic partnerships with PDVSA.  PDVSA will supply natural gas to ACCROVEN, a $415 million natural gas extraction, fractionation, storage and refrigeration project with facilities in San Joaquin, Santa Barbara, and Jose that Enron recently constructed and will own and operate.  Enron is also developing a $700 million LNG project, which will include PDVSA as an equity partner and as the supplier of natural gas.  The final hurdle is authorization from the Venezuelan government that there are sufficient natural gas for the project.  

Attendees:
ANA KARINA SOLER - PDVSA GAS  
Director, Commercial Development   

OSCAR MONTENEGRO - PDVSA GAS 
Superintendant, Contracts & Negotiations 

CARLOS PEREZ - PDVSA GAS 
Manager, Commercial Business 
  
GONZALO ALVAREZ - INTESA
Account Manager for PDVSA GAS.

I hope all is well with you.  Hopefully, we will be starting up in the next weeks as UBS.

I don't know if you are still in the market for people.  I have attached the resume of Vickie Versen
for your review.  She was most recently responsible for trading physical gas in the Gulf.  She came out of 
our scheduling/logistics group and has extensive experience working on several East pipes.  I think she would 
consider a trading or scheduling position.

Sincerely,

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Andrea,

The two gentlemen that I mentioned on my voice mail are Kevin Murray and Leonidas Savas.  Both are from LSU and
start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would 
do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference.

thanks,

Scott

Scott,

I just wanted to let you know what is going on down here. 

1. I will give you a printout of what curves are in what curve files. Currently there are 2 basis files and 1 intramonth. If we need to split out certain curves to individual traders 
and their markets, we can. I just need to know who will be doing what. I think the simplest way to do this is to write the trader's name above the curve name on the printout I give you and I can make the adjustments. I will give this printout to you tomorrow. 

2. We are currently setting up a curve directory that all the traders can get into. This should be set up by tomorrow. Once any adjustments to (if any) the curve files are complete, I will save them to this directory. The traders who will have curve files will need to establish any links, spreads, or etc.  within them. (i.e.. linking one curve to another)

3. I will give the online trading group any product changes that you give me. They should make the necessary changes in the product list.

We plan to load curves Wednesday for testing, so this all needs to be done rather quickly. Thanks for your help. 

Scott

We will loop in Fred and his group as well. Unless you or Hunter have another suggestion that is what I will do.  I will make sure that info learned will be passed along.

Re: Meeting to Address Processing Plant Issues

Transco has been asked by several of its customers to 
address the dynamics of gas processing and its corresponding 
impact on gas quality and the overall operations on the 
Transco system.  In response, Transco will host a meeting in 
Houston from 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday,  October 17, 
2001 at the Williams Tower to bring together 
producer/operators, processing plant operators and local 
distribution companies.  

The meeting will be in a round-table discussion format to 
enable a wide-ranging, open dialogue among participants that 
are impacted by the dynamics of gas prices and processing 
margins. 

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 by Friday, 
October 12, 2001 so that the appropriate facilities can be 
made available.

Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.

Frank

Dear PeeWee Baseball '02 Player:

It's hard to believe that the 2002 SBMSA Baseball season is just around
the corner, but it is!  This year's Skills Evaluations for Westchester
PeeWees (3rd and 4th grades) will be held at the Spring Forest fields on
Saturday and Sunday, February 2nd and 3rd.  More information on this
will be telephoned to each player early next week that will detail the
exact time to show-up.  For those of us, however, that are in need of a
little ""warm-up"" before the evaluations, informal batting practice
(machine) and fielding drills will be going on next Wednesday and
Thursday (Jan 30 and 31st) at the Spring Forest fields from 6 - 8 pm.
To participate, come by either day (or both) with your glove, bat and
batting helmet.

See you next week,

David Benninger
Westchester PeeWee Commissioner
