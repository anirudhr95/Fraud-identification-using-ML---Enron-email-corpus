"RE: Scott Neal East desk meeting","Scott, that is a great idea.  Alot to discuss as we prepare to get started.  I am a member of the UBS Re-start subcommittee.  It meets every Tuesday at 10:00.  I would really benefit from attending your meeting but I have a time conflict.  Would you consider changing the time ?  Before 10 am or after 12 noon if possible.

Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 

List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 

In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 

Tks - Bob

"Dominion '01 Earnings Exceed Estimates Despite $348M 4Q Charges","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Jan 16, 9:52 AM
Dominion '01 Earnings Exceed Estimates Despite $348M 4Q Charges 
Dominion said Wednesday its 2001 operating earnings, excluding special charges, are expected to ""meet or slightly exceed"" analyst expectations of $4.15 per share, and it reaffirmed its 2002 earnings guidance of $4.90-4.95 per share. The higher earnings come despite fourth quarter write-downs of about $348 million, created by $97 million related to Enron Corp. exposure, a write-down of Dominion Capital assets worth $183 million, and a restructuring initiative announced in November, which will cost $68 million. 
The Richmond, VA-based integrated energy company said the Enron charge is ""related to credit exposure on past energy sales to Enron for which payment has not yet been received,"" totaling $6 million, and the ""impaired value of forward natural gas contracts with Enron,"" worth $91 million. Dominion said the Enron charges are non-cash, and with the fourth quarter charge, the company ""substantially eliminates any further Enron-related earnings exposure going forward."" 
Dominion has hedged more than 60% of its expected 2002 gas volumes and has hedged about 40% of its expected 2003 gas volumes at prices ""significantly"" above current market prices. Because of the hedging program and cost-cutting initiatives, Dominion said it is ""positioned to exceed the consensus analyst estimate of $4.89 per share in 2002 and to grow earnings thereafter at an average annual rate of 10%."" 
""The Enron bankruptcy was the industry's equivalent of a 'thousand-year flood',"" said CEO Thomas E. Capps. ""The floodwaters are receding. As a result of some very costly but important lessons learned, the industry will be financially stronger overall. However, the Enron collapse has set in motion and accelerated a badly needed weeding-out process in the industry. The strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker."" 
Capps said a ""handful"" of ""financially strong, asset-heavy and integrated industry leaders, including Dominion, are already benefiting from a 'flight to quality' as energy users seek out suppliers they know they can count on to be there when the energy is needed."" 
Another write-down, for Dominion Capital, is related to the value of its assets and increased loan loss reserves. When Dominion completed its merger with CNG in January 2000, it became a registered company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), which prohibits registered companies from engaging in business not functionally related to the energy business. To comply with PUHCA, Dominion had to divest Dominion Capital, its financial services business, within a defined period, ""which happened to overlap a recession."" The company said it anticipates no other Dominion Capital asset write-downs or loan loss reserve adjustments. 
""We have conducted a rigorous review of all of our assets, with a particular focus on non-core assets,"" said Capps. ""There were significant fourth quarter events that led to a decline in consumer and business confidence and triggered an impairment of Dominion Capital assets. The adjusted values should allow us to pursue liquidation without negatively impacting earnings or the balance sheet going forward."" 
Dominion has scheduled an earnings call for 10 a.m. EST on Jan. 24. To participate, call (800) 314-7867 or view a live web cast at www.dom.com/investors. <http://www.dom.com/investors.>

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Explains How Enron
                                          Works








How Enron Works
The mule market.
By Joe Bob Briggs, a writer for UPI
January 22, 2002 9:25 a.m.

Here's how Enron works. It's really quite simple. Ismail is a successful
mule trader in Peshawar. Every year Ismail delivers 30 mules to the Kabul
Mule Market and gets $40 per mule.

This year, however, the Khyber Pass is full of warlord militias, so Ismail
is not sure he can drive his mules to market without losing a mule here and
there. Also, the demand for mules in Kabul seems to be dropping. Maybe
he'll
only be able to sell 20 mules, or, God forbid, 15, and then be forced to
feed and water the rest of them on a money-losing trek back home. In other
words, it's a scary market and Ismail is worried about feeding his family.

What Ismail needs is to limit his risk with an Enron derivatives package.
First he pays $2 per mule for a Khyber Pass Derivative, so that any mule
killed or stolen by warlords will be reimbursed at the rate of $20 per
mule-half the going market rate, but still better than taking a total loss.
Next he buys Enron Mule Futures. For $28 per contract, he guarantees
delivery of a mule in three months time. He takes 15 of these, figuring
that
a guaranteed $28 mule sale is better than showing up in Kabul and
discovering that the mule buyers have been killed by stray bombs.

Meanwhile, at the Enron Mule Trading Desk in Houston, eagle-eyed yuppies
are
studying the worldwide mule markets and starting to have their doubts about
those $28 delivery contracts. Mule use is dropping all over Afghanistan,
even as the mule count is dwindling. Better resell eight of those 15
contracts to a European commodities broker for $24 each, then make up that
$32 loss somewhere else while cutting the company's exposure in half. But
how to hedge the risk on the other seven?

Aha! A blip on the computer screen. A temporary mule shortage in southern
Iran! With a current mule price of $42 in Tehran, Enron could offer a
Linked
Mule Swap Double Derivative tied to the gap between the price of mules
delivered in Kabul on a given date and the price in Tehran on the same
date.
Sure, you would rather have the quick-and-clean Iran sale, instead of the
sale in Kabul that requires trucking the mules to a foreign market. But
even
if you add in $4 per mule for transport through militia-held territory and
averaged the markets together, you can still clear eight bucks just on the
gap alone.

Enron's average price-per-future-mule is now $32.57 when you include the
$4-per-mule loss on the mule futures dumped in Europe. But based on the
amazing $12 Kabul/Tehran trading gap, they can easily put together a
""delivery in either market"" contract that will allow them to ask $36 per
mule on their Mule Online Internet trading system. The first mule future
sells instantly for $36, and the price bobs up to $36.50. Two mules go for
$36.75, and then there's a big jump for the last three mules to $37.90.
Enron has now off-loaded all its price-based mule futures liability for a
profit of $31.70.

But this doesn't mean they're out of the mule market in Central Asia. It's
still two months until Ismail delivers his 30 mules, and Enron is on the
hook for his Khyber Pass derivative insurance policy.

Things are not looking good in that part of the world, either. The chances
of a mule being picked off as a road-passage tax are pretty high, and the
loss of the whole herd would be a $600 liability. Quickly, the financial
boys go to work, and part of that liability is resold to a consortium of
Singapore banks, Australian mutual funds, and Saudi Arabian arms merchant
Adnan Kashoggi, thereby reducing Enron's percentage to 25 percent, or $150
in potential liability against a $15 premium (remember the $2 per mule paid
by Ismail), and Enron also takes a brokerage fee of $20 from the three
other
partners, thereby reducing its real liability to just $120.

But that's still too much of a spread, so Enron continues to hedge.
Fortunately, the company has such a diversified trading floor that Enron
mule-market experts can walk over to the traders in the warlord-militia
derivatives department. Sure enough, at least four tribes near the Khyber
Pass are increasingly concerned about profit margins. There simply aren't
enough people to rob. Things have gotten so bad, in fact, that the warlords
are hedging against the oncoming winter by taking futures positions in
stolen chickens, stolen humanitarian aid trucks, and Western hostages.
There's not a mule market yet, because the warlords have successfully
converted many of the recalcitrant villagers into pack animals. But Enron
knows how to MAKE markets.

Quickly the numbers-crunchers go to work, and they soon determine that the
average number of stolen mules per 100-man militia is 1.4 per year. That
represents anywhere from $28 to $56 in lost mule-thievery income if the
Khyber Pass is closed or inhospitable to traders from Pakistan. Amortizing
that amount over 12 months, the warlords have an exposure of anywhere from
$2.33 to $4.67 per month in lost pillage. Hence Enron announces the new
Highway Robbery Derivative, in which each tribe is guaranteed the value of
two stolen mules in each 12-month period in return for paying a premium of
$4 per month.

Enron's hedge is now complete, and it's a beautiful thing to behold. The
chances of Ismail losing a mule to a raiding party are approximately one in
30, or 3.33 percent. Since he's paying $60 for his derivative contract, the
expected loss of 3.33 percent of his herd would result in a payment of only
$20 ? a more than comfortable spread. Meanwhile, if the mule is stolen by a
warlord holding a Highway Robbery Derivative, then the payment to the other
side would only be $28 against premiums of $48. If Ismail simply passes
through the Khyber Pass without incident and sells all his mules at the
standard price, Enron pockets $60 from Ismail and $48 each from four
warlords, in addition to the previous profit of $31.70 from that heady
Internet mule-futures trading day and the $20 in packaging commissions. If
each warlord steals his standard 1.4 mules per year, then Enron still owes
six-tenths of one mule to the warlord, or about $22.20 based on a $37 sale
price.

Total expected profit, based on 5.6 stolen mules, one of which is stolen
from Ismail: $143.20. Total profit from all Ismail-related mule
transactions: $194.90. See, it's simple when you know how it works. Ask

"TBG","Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.

I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2 resumes
that are worth a look.  

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives knowledge and industry experience.  She has 
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination opportunities also.
 


Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in 
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she 
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.

  November 23, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

"Risk Operations","All, 
I received a call from Sally Beck today alerting me to concerns about spreading the risk group across the floor (gas team - power team).  From a control perspective she prefers that the team be all together.  

Can you factor this in and give Sally and me your thoughts as well?  Perhaps we could find an area that is more central to both groups that will help with this (as we've done with fundies).  

Scott and I are meeting Tuesday afternoon at 4:00 - Lloyd and Sally are you free to join us to keep us all on the same page?  Please let me know so I can reserve a room.

Tammy

"almost final","Scott, 
Attached is the file with Lavo's changes.  Note he's added a couple of interest rate desks and put gas weather and another fundies person in - Bob Superty was looking for 3 logistics support people that should be on the floor,  Tammy Jaquet, Richard Pinion, and Natalie Baker.  Please assign them and the assistants a desk.

We are out of time on turning this churn in.  I must have it by noon.  I will be meeting with the move team tomorrow afternoon to set move dates.  I'm being asked about  the trading simulation for next week and since your churns aren't set I can't provide an answer.

Ina, please pull in whomever you need to work on the churn,  be sure and get with Superty's asst to help you with those people etc.

Regards,
Tammy

The store is located between the old Hempstead Highway  and US 290 (actually closer to the Hempstead Highway).  Jerald is a  knowledgeable pit master and has this model in stock.

Brothers, 
I read the recent newsletter from Texas Gamma...glad things are going 
well. 
Unfortunately I will be unable to attend alumni weekend, but do have 
some info to share with you for Spring newsletter. Many of the brothers 
from 1981-87 may recall I was an active accordionist. I recently won an 
international accordionist competition in the catagory of Texas Folk 
Music and they have established my webpage as part of the prize. Please 
share this info and address with our brothers.

Western Power Prices Drop Despite Higher Demand Forecast

     Los Angeles, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western peak
power prices for Wednesday delivery continued lower today,
despite a forecast by the California Independent System Operator
calling for higher electricity demand tomorrow, traders said.
     According to the Cal-ISO, demand in the state is projected
to increase by 16.4 percent tomorrow to 35,119 megawatts, up from
today's 30,166-megawatt estimate.
     Traders said with the potential for strong price spikes in
tomorrow's next-day markets, it was less risky to sell power on a
real-time basis today.
     ""We were surprised how depressed the next-day prices were
because the forecast is calling for warm weather pretty much
everywhere,"" said one western next-day power trader. ""With the
next-day markets in the tank, many sellers were taking their
energy into the real-time markets.""
     The most severe price declines were seen in the Pacific
Northwest and Rockies next-day markets, where from the Ault,
Colorado, pricing point declined an average of $65 from Friday's
close to $100 a megawatt-hour.
     ""We're moving all of our excess energy to other pricing
points such as Mid Columbia, Palo Verde and Four Corners, because
right now, there's very little next day demand in our region,""
one Rockies trader said.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services
Corp., projected daily high temperatures in Los Angeles area will
drop by one degree Fahrenheit tomorrow to 73 degrees. In Southern
California, though, hotter weather is expected, with Long Beach
expected to top out at 84 degrees tomorrow, up from today's 78-
degree forecast high.
     Pacific Northwest power pricing at the Mid-Columbia pricing
point declined an average of $46.38 from Friday to a Bloomberg
index of $104.44. Light load power pricing fell $35.86 to an
average $42.00, though trading was thin.
     Traders said that yesterday's $3-$10 real-time pricing in
the West may have carried over into today's next-day market.
     ""The next-day market in the Northwest may have been
irrationally priced to the real-time numbers today,"" said one
Northwest power trader. ""It's possible for that to happen.""
     Other Northwest traders said that the recent refill at the
Grand Coulee Dam could be seen as a sign that excess power
generation could soon be available once the reservoir is filled
in preparation for winter.
     At last report, the Grand Coulee was at 1,269 feet of water,
or about 98.4 percent of its 1,290 feet maximum water storage
level. On this date in 2000, Grand Coulee was at about 1,244.8
feet of water, or about 96.5 percent of capacity.
     In the Southwest, power pricing declined despite
expectations for hot weather all week. Forecasts for the Phoenix
vicinity call for daily high temperatures to average in the low-
to-mid 100s this week.
     The Bloomberg Palo Verde next-day index price declined an
average of $38.59 to $127.21 amid trades in the $110.00-$180.00
range. Light load Palo Verde power, which began trade at the $35-
$45 level, declined to an average of $23.92, as prices slumped to
$15.00-$18.00 toward the end of daily options expiration.
     ""Prices started dropping and then we just didn't do
anything,"" said one southwest daily utility power trader. ""It's
the end of the month and nobody wants to get caught long at this
point.""

Northeast Spot Power Prices Dip With Low Weather-Related
Demand

     Philadelphia, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot power
prices dropped throughout the Northeast U.S. this morning
amid low weather-related demand and increased generating
capacity, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton,
Missouri, temperatures in the Northeast will average 5
degrees Fahrenheit below normal over the next seven days,
keeping energy usage for cooling near to below normal
during that period.
     In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
Interconnection, next-day power was assessed $3.30 lower at
a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $27.95 per megawatt-
hour, the lowest daily index price since Sept. 28, 2000.
     ""There's just no support right now in the cash
market,"" said one PJM-based trader. ""You've got risk and
warmer weather helping to prop up the next-week market, but
the dailies are a different story. Who wants to take length
at these prices, when you can just go hourly on an as-
needed basis?""
     Traders said lackluster pool rates, a function of
increased generation, also pulled day-ahead prices lower.
Interconnection data shows locational marginal prices for
the four hours leading up to daily options expiration, or
10 a.m. local time, averaged only $22.37 per megawatt-hour,
with a low and high of $14.00 and $24.84, respectively.
     Nuclear Regulatory Commission data shows the region's
nuclear output at 98 percent of its 13,160-megawatt
capacity, and according to the Interconnection, only 3,049
megawatts are off-line in total.
     Public Service Electric & Gas boosted output at its
1,150-megawatt Salem 1 nuclear reactor to 85 percent this
morning. Company officials told Bloomberg they restarted
the New Jersey-based unit Friday, following an unplanned
unit trip.
     New England day-ahead values also fell with increased
supply and decreased demand. The Bloomberg index price for
peak power delivered Wednesday throughout NEPool was

Below-Normal Temperatures Pull Mid-Continent Power Prices Down

     Cincinnati, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak day-ahead
power prices dropped in the Mid-Continent U.S. as below-normal
temperatures were forecast to continue through the week amid a
surplus of generation, traders said.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures would average almost 6 degrees Fahrenheit below
normal in the north-central U.S. over the next seven days.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Wednesday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system declined
$4.60 to $18.80 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $22.00
when the market opened down to $16.50 after options expired.
     With today's decline, Cinergy day-ahead power prices reached
a new year-low for the fourth time in five days.
     ""We're in for another ho-hum week,"" an East Central Area
Reliability Council trader said. ""There's no weather out there
and maintenance is done, so the market's flooded with megawatts.""
     However, ECAR traders said an expected return to normal
temperatures next week boosted prices for power delivered then.
Cinergy parcels for delivery from June 4-8 were offered at
$60.50, up from $58.30 Friday.
     ""Next week is up; in fact its really overvalued at this
point,"" one trader said. ""We're going to see warmer weather, but
nothing crazy. I have a feeling that price is just going to get
chipped away at day by day as that realization sets in.""
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, next-day power
prices also fell with mild weather, marketers said. Peak parcels
into the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $4.21 less on
average at $18.00-$20.00, and power in lower MAIN sold $3.85 less
at $18.00-$23.00.
     MAIN traders said short-term forward prices were also
overvalued at ComEd, with power for delivery from June 4-8
offered at $57.75 there although temperatures weren't expected to
be more than 1 degree above normal for the period.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak Wednesday power prices
fell an average of $2.04 in the northern half of the region to
$22.00-$27.00 and $2.22 in southern areas to $24.00-$26.00.
     MAPP traders said prices there remained higher than in other
areas with continued demand from the Southwest Power Pool, where
day-ahead peak power sold 71 cents higher on average at $25.50-
$34.25.

Southeast Spot Power Prices Mixed on Weather Related Demand

     Atlanta, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) - U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices for power delivered Wednesday were mixed
today because of scattered pockets of weather-related demand,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price declined
$1.10 a megawatt-hour from Friday to $28.14 amid trades in the
$18.25-$38.00 range.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc., forecast
temperatures in the Southeast would average about 1.9 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal over the next seven days
     The Bloomberg index price for power on the New Orleans-
based Entergy Corp. grid for delivery tomorrow fell 55 cents to
$35.08, with sales between $34.50-$35.50.
     ""There is no heat and demand is low, causing prices to
decline,'' said one Southeast trader.
     One Tennessee Valley Authority trader said offers were put
out early today in the low $20s, though later volumes moved at
$18.25-$20.50 as demand was no there. The Bloomberg index for
TVA declined $3.50 to $20.50.
     TVA traders said that prices were falling because
generation from maintenance has returned to the grid and demand
was not there because of mild weather.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp., daily high temperatures in Bristol, Tennessee
were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and 77
degrees tomorrow.
     In Texas, traders said day-ahead firm ""UB'' in the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas sold at a Bloomberg index
of $39.50, gaining $2.00 from Friday. Trades were completed in
the forward market for June at $50.00.
     Traders said that prices should remain steady to down this
week, as demand for power will depend on the weather.

U.K. Month-Ahead Power Prices Slip as Market Re-adjusts Levels

     London, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. power prices fell
slipped today amid increased selling as participants sold
contracts deemed overvalued, traders said.
     July baseload traded at 17.75 pounds a megawatt-hour, 20
pence lower than Friday. August traded at 17.85 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 10 pence lower than yesterday.
     ""There's a lot of selling pressure. When we have day-ahead
trading at 17.30 pounds, it seems only logical that July should be
lower,'' one trader said.
     July baseload has fallen by around 1.55 pounds since the
start of May as participants traded actively in an effort to find
new price levels under the new trading arrangements, traders said.
     The rest of the market remained little changed as activity
continued to be unusually quiet for the third consecutive day.
     Winter 2001 baseload remained unchanged from Friday following
trades at 21.46 pounds a megawatt-hour.

Nordic Power Falls on Wet Weather as Market Awaits New Signals

     Lysaker, Norway, May 29 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed
lower in limited trade today after wetter weather forecasts
boosted expectations of increased hydro production, traders said.
     With 168.00 megawatts traded, week 23 closed at 204.25
Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour, down 1.25 kroner. Week 24 fell
1.75 kroner to 207.75 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Although weather forecasts were ""slightly'' wetter today,
there were no ""significant'' market signals to move the market
further down or to boost trade volumes, a trader said.
     A total 1,052 gigawatt-hours generation were exchanged today
down from 2,563 gigawatt-hours last Tuesday.
     Wednesday's system area average price was set in line with
expectations at 211.72 kroner a megawatt-hour, 3.44 kroner higher
than today's price.
     Strong winds in Denmark also contributed to falling prices.
Danish wind generators can produce up to 2,000 megawatts, a trader
said earlier today, adding it's difficult to anticipate output.
     Above-average precipitation was forecast across Scandinavia
over the next 5 days by Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.
Increased rainfall in Southern Norway was likely to contribute to
water tank replenishment, an Oslo-based trader said.
     Winter-2, 2001 fell 1.5 kroner to 220.0 kroner a megawatt
hour after 137.0 megawatts traded.
     ""There's no reason for producers to sell power any cheaper
than at winter prices,'' a trader said, adding generators would
keep high prices until next winter, except during the Norwegian
industrial holiday season in the last 3 weeks of July.

Comments from trading track phone interviews:


Fred Baloutch  -  recommendation: invite in for interview  -  excellent academic results, very smart, some summer gas experience with BC gas, did some work with weater derivatives,  very enthusiatic 

Carlos Betancourt  -  recommendation: do not invite for interview - unable to communicate relavent experience.

Seung ""Sam"" Hyun Cho -  recommendation:  invite for interview ( however, Sam does not graduate until May '02, so Associate program recruiting may be a better fit.)  excellent academic results,  able to discuss a wide variety of subject material regarding trading,  strong understanding of risk and derviatives. 


Please let me know if you need additional information.

Guys,

You have been selected to complete the telephone screening of external candidates for second and final round.  Each  candidate will be screened by two traders to ensure agreement on quality of candidates.   (these resumes have already been selected from c. 200 resumes by some of the ENA Traders).  

As in the previous Trading Track recruiting event, you will be given a few days to complete this.  The candidates will be expecting your call, there is no set interview time therefore allowing you flexibility to call in the evening from home if necessary.   Resumes, telephone numbers etc will reach your desk tomorrow morning.   All phone screens to be completed by Tuesday pm: 16th October.

Any questions please call myself or Adrianne Engler.

Thanks,

 Karen.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

Western U.S. Electricity Prices Fall Amid Less Weekend Demand

     Los Angeles, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices for
Friday-Saturday deliveries in the Western U.S. fell today, the
fourth consecutive decline in day-ahead values, amid less weekend
demand, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
slipped $14.00 a megawatt-hour to $38.00 amid trades at $33.00-
$43.00. Off-peak power fell $11.41, with trades completed from
$20.00-$27.00.
     Traders said that prices typically fall on Thursday because
demand is significantly lower over the weekend with businesses and
schools closed.
     ""Between all of the generation that is available to the grid
and with less weekend demand and cooler temperatures, this is why
we are seeing prices crumble,'' said one Northwest trader.
     The California Independent System Operator reported 6,017.77
megawatts of generation was curtailed in California for planned
and unplanned maintenance, 230.12 megawatts less than Wednesday
and 52.2 percent less than a month ago.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, the
Bloomberg index for peak power declined $10.37 from yesterday to
$33.00-$55.00, with trades completed to at $41.43.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services
Corp., temperatures in San Francisco were expected to peak today
at 67 degrees Fahrenheit.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California peak power
declined $16.91 to a Bloomberg index of $47.88, the low for the
year, with sales completed at $38.00-$58.00.
     In the Southwest, power prices sank an average of $26.43 at
the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $52.14 amid
trades in the $48.00-$70.00 range.

PJM Spot Power Prices Climb With Air Conditioning Loads

     Philadelphia, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Next-day power
prices rose for the fifth consecutive day in the Pennsylvania-New
Jersey-Maryland Interconnection as higher temperatures were
expected to increase regional cooling loads, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in Philadelphia will average 2 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal over the next seven days, generating a 23 percent
greater than normal cooling demand. Friday, temperatures are
forecast to reach as high as 80 degrees.
     Peak power scheduled for Friday delivery to the Western Hub
of PJM was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $30.28
per megawatt hour, up $1.53 from yesterday and $6.75 from the
week-ago price.
     Short-term over-the-counter products also traded higher on
expectations for heat. Next-week power sold as high as $45.00 this
morning, compared to $40.50 yesterday, and balance of the month
dealt as high as $47.50, compared to $44.50 yesterday.
     Weather Derivatives Corp. predicted temperatures in the
Northeast would average 4.8 degrees normal over the next 6-10
days. Philadelphia temperatures are expected to reach 80 degrees
again Monday and increase 2 degrees each subsequent day through
Wednesday.
     ""Finally, we've got some heat coming in, or so they say,""
said one PJM-based trader. ""There's still some skepticism as to
whether or not it will actually happen, but if it warms up
tomorrow I think you'll see a lot more bullish conviction. An 80-
degree day would give this market the boost of confidence it's
looking for.""
      In the New England Power Pool, for-Friday power traded 85
cents higher at a Bloomberg index price of $36.75, also supported
by rising temperatures. Traders cited deals in the $36.50-$37.00
range.
     Day-ahead values fell across all three zones of the New York
Power Pool amid increased nuclear generation and a lack of market
liquidity, traders said. Entergy Corp. returned its Indian Point 3
nuclear facility to full capacity today, following completion of
condenser pump maintenance and motor replacement. The station is
located in Buchanan, New York, and has a total output of 980
megawatts.
     While Zones A and G traded $1.25 and $2.13 lower at $28.88
and $39.88 indexes, respectively, traders said no deals were
executed in Zone J ""because the market was just too wide to get
anything done,"" with a bid and offer range of $44.00-$48.00.
     ""As far as liquidity goes, this is one of the worst days I've
ever seen,"" said one New York trader. ""New England will bounce
around a few cents here and there because there's enough liquidity
to support the market, but in New York you just don't have that
luxury.""
     Traders said they're often reticent to take on new positions
for fear illiquid market conditions won't allow them to abandon
those positions when necessary.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Climb on Southern Heat, Transmission

     Cincinnati, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Increasing weather-
related demand from the South and a possible unit outage in the
East Central Area Reliability Council drove peak spot power
prices up again today in the Mid-Continent U.S., traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose $4.09
to $31.40 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.00 when
the market opened up to $34.50 after options expired.
     ECAR traders said both higher prices in the Southeast and
transmission problems limiting the amount of power that could be
sent there drove Cinergy prices up in early trading.
     They said late higher-priced transactions came as marketers
who oversold power south were forced to buy replacement energy at
a premium because most sellers had left the market.
     Day-ahead volume at the Cinergy hub was limited by
transmission problems, leading most players to focus on the
short-term over-the-counter market, where power for delivery from
June 11-15 was offered at $45.00 on expectations of warmer
weather.
     ""There's more money to be made in the next week market right
now,"" an ECAR trader said, ""so more of the focus is there. I do
think its still overvalued without a definite weather forecast;
the only thing bullish could be the Zimmer outage.""
     Traders said Cinergy Corp.'s 1,300-megawatt Zimmer coal-
fired plant shut yesterday afternoon for unknown reasons and
could remain down into next week, forcing utilities to run
higher-cost gas-fired generation if hot weather arrives.
     In the Mid-America Interconnected Network, traders said
prices at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub continued to
follow Cinergy up, climbing $4.04 to $30.00-$32.50 as marketers
bought ComEd power to replace parcels sold into Cinergy.
     Power in the lower half of MAIN sold $1.95 higher on average
at $28.00-$34.00 as marketers there sold excess power into the
high-priced Entergy Corp. grid, where power traded $2.56 higher
at $35.50-$37.25.
     The Mid-Continent Area Power Pool next-day market also
climbed today on increased demand from the south, with peak power
selling $4.00 higher on average in northern MAPP at $25.00-$27.00
and $3.57 higher in southern MAPP at $27.00-$33.00.
     MAPP traders said activity was light, with most sales from
north to south. They said forecasts for temperatures over 80
degrees Fahrenheit boosted demand from the Southwest Power Pool,
where day-ahead power sold $6.39 higher at $28.50-$33.00.

Most Southeast Prices Continue to Rise With Increased Demand

     Nashville, Tennessee, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Spot
electricity prices rose throughout most of the Southeast U.S.
this morning because of increased weather-related demand, traders
said.
     ""Prices are rising with warmer weather,"" said one Southeast
trader. ""Temperatures in New Orleans are warming up, and it's
causing prices at the Entergy Hub to increase.''
     Peak power scheduled for Friday delivery to the Entergy
Corp. grid traded between $35.50-$37.25 a megawatt hour,
increasing $2.56 to a Bloomberg index of $36.67.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in New Orleans will peak at 86
degrees Fahrenheit today and 87 degrees tomorrow.
     Forecasters predict the warm weather will continue into next
week, with temperatures in Southeast expected to average 2.4
degrees above normal over the next 6-10 days.
     Electricity parcels for delivery into the Tennessee Valley
Authority transmission grid traded at $31.75-$33.00, putting the
Bloomberg index price at $32.17, up $4.17 from yesterday.
     ""Prices are increasing as rising temperatures are causing
air conditioning loads to boost,'' said one Southeast trader.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price for next-day
power increased $1.08 from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$35.92, amid trades in the $26.75-$48.00 range.
     In the Northern section of the Southwest Power Pool, peak
power increased $6.39 to a Bloomberg index of $30.64, with sales
completed at $28.50-$33.00.
     Traders said Northern SPP power prices increased because of
transmission problems, which hampered deliveries to the region.

U.K. Power Prices Fall Amid Active Selling of Contracts

     London, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K
fell for a third consecutive day as participants continued to sell
contracts deemed over-valued, traders said.
     Winter 2001/02 baseload traded 26 pence lower having last
traded at 21.28 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Heavy selling persisted as participants looked at
continuously falling near-term prices for the future direction of
further-out prices under the New Electricity Trading Arrangements,
traders said.
     Since the launch of NETA last March, participants have been
trading actively in an effort to discover new prices levels.
     September baseload traded 10 pence lower, having been last
bid at 19.55 pounds a megawatt-hour. The contract has fallen by
over 2.70 pounds since the start of May.
     Traders contributed the fall in short-term prices to excess
supply.
     ""There is constant selling pressure. You can only buy so
much, there are only so many customers and therefore there's
always spare generation going,"" one trader said.
     Winter 2001 peakload contracts fell 25 pence following trades
at 28.10 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Although prices fell on ""genuine"" selling interest, another
trader said prices fell amid profit-taking as several participants
sold contracts they had purchased earlier this month.
     Recent price gains created profitable opportunities for
traders to buy the contracts and sell them back later at a profit,
once they had risen above their purchase price.

Seasonal Nordic Power Jumps as Rainfall Expected to Decrease

     Lysaker, Norway, June 7 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Seasonal
electricity contract prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in
Lysaker, Norway, closed at new record highs today on anticipation
that decreased precipitation would curb hydro-supply, traders
said.
     Winter-2, 2001 jumped 1.75 Norwegian kroner to a new record
high of 223.75 kroner a megawatt-hour after 372.00 megawatts were
exchanged. Winter-1, 2002 gained 2.25 kroner to close at a record
229.75 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""Everybody was just waiting for signals of decreasing
rainfall to resume buying,'' an Oslo-based trader said earlier
today.
     Reduced generation next week because of planned maintenance
at several nuclear plants would also contribute to continued price
gains, another trader said. System area average prices next week
could be set above 230 kroner a megawatt-hour, the trader added.
     Still, shorter-term structures fell after Friday's spot price
averaged an unexpectedly low 208.45 kroner a megawatt-hour, down
14.38 kroner from today's price because industrial end-users
typically reduce consumption ahead of the weekend.
     Week 24 fell 1.0 kroner to 211.0 kroner a megawatt-hour after
346.0 megawatts traded. Week 25 closed little changed at 207.5
kroner a megawatt-hour with 217.0 megawatts exchanged.
     A total of 2,827 gigawatt-hours generation traded on Nordpool
today, down from 3,301 gigawatt-hours yesterday.

We have booked the remaining volumes in a ""dummy book"" to see the value for Tennessee Energy Acquisition and MGAM.  They are income to the east and central desks, creating additional index positions.  How would you like to handle this with the firm traders?  They will need to sign off on this.

Mark, any objections of us booking the additional months since we now have the contracts?

"RE: Beach Outing","
Mark and Brett and I will not be able to come this weekend due to baseball
conflicts.  Sorry for the late timing but I've been out of town and we just
got the schedule the other day (we were hoping the tournament was going to
be somewhere close to Rod's place like LaPorte or League City, which would
have let us do both but no, they're on the other side of the world in
Cy-Fair).  Have a great time!

Yah-te-hey!

Scott Neal --  This is FYI

ok i think i understand

1)  Kam we need to book the MGAM and TEAC for the correct term.  Any losses would hit the desk as this represents deal entry error and the CES book (for taking hits) doesn't exist anymore --  How big is the $ value of the MTM?

2)  Scott Goodell, you need to call Calderone to resolve MGAG

I have not heard from Calderone as of today concerning MGA Georgia. ENA shows this only thru December, per the Exhibit A.  

MGA Mississippi and TEAC are recognized as ENA for the term. 
I defer to Scott Neal on how he wants to handle with the firm traders and booking the additional months.

His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. !  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel! , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught o! ne! pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 3 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Thursday, January 10, 2002.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN (1 * $2,500)
=              $2,500
One Short Tier 3 NG or NN     (1 * $2,000)
=         -    $2,000
Net Scan Risk       ($2,500-$2,000)
=              $   500
Spread Rate         (1* $500)
=         +    $   500

"TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : January 14, 2002
TransCanada Plans Export Capacity Additions 
While it will take another two years for a Mackenzie Valley production and pipeline project to come together, there are signs that a safety margin is developing in Canadian natural gas supplies. Western Canada's established, heavily exploited gas fields can still deliver production growth for years to come, the National Energy Board has been told. 
TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. delivered the reassuring word in an application for a year-2002 expansion program dedicated primarily to increasing exports to California and the northwestern United States. TransCanada predicted that production from the western provinces can rise by about 15% to a sustained rate of 20 Bcf/d until at least 2010. 
Titled the Westpath Expansion, TransCanada's proposal calls for $48.3 million in new facilities to raise capacity on its British Columbia System by 420 MMcf/d or 16% to about 3 Bcf/d. The route crosses southeastern B.C. from the Alberta boundary to an export point on the U.S. border, where it fills PG&E Gas Transmission. 
Along with U.S. traders and power generators, customers lined up for the added service include Vancouver distributor BC Gas Utility Ltd. and Powerex Corp., a subsidiary of BC Hydro that procures fuel for gas-fired power stations. 
TransCanada told the NEB that it also expects to file a further expansion proposal in second-quarter 2002 for the B.C. System. The agenda matches growth under way on PG&E. TransCanada acknowledges that its forecast of supplies from the western provinces is more optimistic than the current expectations of the NEB, the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board and the Canadian Gas Potential Committee. The pipeline company said its information goes beyond official public records to include confidential data from customers, its own proprietary studies and updated information on results of last year's boom in gas drilling. 
The pipeline has told the NEB that ""with continued demand growth, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin should be able to support increasing levels of gas deliveries of up to 20 Bcf/d at least through this decade."" Production from Alberta, B.C. and Saskatchewan averaged an estimated 17.2 Bcf/d in 2001. TransCanada also predicts that ""unconventional gas"" -- chiefly coalbed methane, and possibly reserves in ""tight"" or difficult geological formations -- will enter production by about 2006 and eventually reach 4 Bcf/d. But the pipeline projection acknowledges most tight gas ""is not currently considered economically available within the forecast horizon (to the year 2025) and current technological assumptions."" At the same time, TransCanada said there is also great uncertainty in predicting gas production from coal deposits because there is none yet in Canada. 
In the absence of a performance record to guide reserves and production projections, the pipeline says only that ""if research and development and economics lead to successful commercial operations, these sources may start contributing supply this decade."" 
In a separate toll case before the NEB, TransCanada predicts it will be 2008 before northern gas -- from either the Northwest Territories or Alaska -- begins to flow south. An announcement Jan. 14 by the Mackenzie Delta Producers Group and the Mackenzie Valley Aboriginal Pipeline Corp. suggested that TransCanada's educated guesswork is on the money. After nearly two years of preliminary feasibility studies and consultations with northern communities, the group -- Imperial Oil, Conoco Canada, Shell Canada and ExxonMobil Canada -- declared intentions to go ahead on a second planning stage. Next comes the ""project definition phase,"" or $200-$250 million in technical, environmental, commercial and consultation work required to make regulatory applications for field, gas-gathering and pipeline facilities. 
Conoco predicted the package will be completed and placed before Canadian authorities in 2003. The group says it intends to tap Arctic discoveries called Taglu, Parsons Lake and Niglintgak to send 1.2-1.5 Bcf/d south to northwestern Alberta. The plan calls for the gas to finish its trip to markets via spare capacity on TransCanada's system. 
TransCanada is in step with the group's expectations in suggesting it will take five years beyond 2003 to collect approvals and build the project. The pipeline company's forecast suggests northern production will arrive gradually, going from a starting rate at 500 MMcf/d in 2008 to 900 MMcf/d in '09, 1.1 Bcf/d in 2010, 1.2 Bcf/d in 2011 and 1.4 Bcf/d by 2012. The new forecast still does not predict which northern gas will flow, however. 
As a partner in the reborn Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., TransCanada is teamed up with eight other companies to revive the Alaska Highway pipeline route worked out in the 1970s for production from Prudhoe Bay. In the documents before the NEB, TransCanada says it ""recognizes various uncertainties with respect to northern gas supply regarding economics, timing, routing and scope. It's unclear as to which pipeline will be successful in attracting northern gas.""

"RE: MGI Supply Ltd (pemex)","Here is the story...November production..we purchased $3.1 MM of gas and sold $3.9 MM.  On December 31, MGI paid us the gross amount. According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past.  MGI assumed that once they paid the 3.9 we would pay the 3.1.  We did not.  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract.  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals.  He wants to know if he is going to get paid.  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name.  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy. Jamie's number is below.

Thanks,
Tanya

Can you call Jaime at MGI/Pemex regarding payments between MGI and Enron?  I think they need an explanation
regarding how payments are made within the bankruptcy proceeding.

Jaime can be reached at 011525 55 232 5996.

Thank you.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy nu! mb! ers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Upda! te! d 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

""Matt has had a couple of weeks to watch. He's champing at the bit to prove whatever he has to prove,"" Head Coach Mike Holmgren told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. We don't recommend Hasselbeck as a Fantasy starter right now, especially against the Dolphins' defense in Week Seven.  Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10! /1! 6/01 Dilfer suffered a pulled groin during Sunday's game against Denver, and he is not expected to be able to play October 28 against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. ""There's more to it than just a normal groin pull. We'll just leave it at that,"" Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren said Monday. ""He's injured, and he won't practice this week."" Dilfer is probably the better Fantasy option of the two, but don't expect him to be able to help your team for the next two weeks.  Tony Richardson , RB KC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 Wheatley had an MRI exam on Monday to determine the extent of the damage he sustained to his right knee Sunday in Indianapolis. The results were expected back Tuesday.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Brian Griese , QB DEN - Matty Upd! at! ed 10/16/01 The Broncos are unsure whether Griese will be ready for Sunday's game in San Diego, according to the Denver Post. However, An MRI Monday morning on his right shoulder revealed no structural damage and no tie to his previous shoulder surgeries. Griese is questionable for Wednesday's practice as well as Sunday's game, and if he's out, expect Gus Frerotte to get the start.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.  Jamal Anderson , RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Anderson underwent successful surgery to repair the torn ACL in his left knee Tuesday. Anderson has already been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/16/01 Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout ! th! e week.   Justin McCareins , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 McCareins will be sidelined six to eight weeks after breaking his ankle Sunday on a kickoff return. He is scheduled to have surgery on the ankle Wednesday to insert a pin in the joint. This is a major setback for the rookie. He started Sunday's game and had two catches for 70 yards.   Eddie Berlin , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Berlin, a rookie receiver used mostly on special teams,  will be sidelined three to four weeks. He suffered a severely separated right shoulder on a kickoff return Sun! da! y.  Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Browns' head coach Butch Davis told The Akron Plain-Dealer that Northcutt will get a lot of playing time this week against the Ravens. Don't expect Northcutt to be too productive, but he is a decent pickup if you need an extra wideout this week.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.  Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Battaglia is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is suffering from a strained left shoulder.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/16/01 Grbac was feeling woozy and nursing a headache Monday, the result of the most severe concussion he's received in nine years in the NFL but he will play Sunday at Cleveland. Grbac was slammed to the ground by Santana Dotson in the second quarter of the Baltimore Ravens' 31-23 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday. The quarterback stayed in the game, but threw interceptions on his next two drives and was pulled eight minutes into the fourth quarter. On Monday, Grbac declared himself fit enough ! to! play. ""I'm still a little foggy, and my wife was waking me up every few hours to see if I was alive,"" he said, ""but I'm feeling OK and I'll be ready.""      Redskins , DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Washington cornerback Fred Smoot suffered a sprained left knee during Monday's game against Dallas. He was on crutches after sustaining the injury and is currently listed as day-to-day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Alexander suffered a sprained right ankle during Monday night's loss to Washington. He was seen using crutches on the sidelines and is listed as day-to-day.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie.   Joe Jurevicius , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Jurevicius suffered a rib injury during Sunday's game against St. Louis. The injury is not considered serious, however, so expect Jurevicius to be in the starting lineup on Monday against Philadelphia.   Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank U! pdated 10/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) informed Head Coach Mike Sherman that he would be available for Sunday's game against Minnesota. Sherman stated that a decision on Schroeder would not be made until later in the week, but we expect him to go.   Joey Galloway , WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/16/01 Galloway suffered a sprained left ankle during Monday night's 9-7 win over Washington. The Cowboys have a bye this week, so Galloway should have amble time to recover from the injury in time for the team's next game.    Reggie Swinton , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Swinton suffered a hamstring injury during pre-game warmups on Monday night. He left the game after the opening kickoff, and is listed as day-to-day.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Harris (groin) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He didn't have a reception in the game, and has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Carter underwent successful surgery to repair the tendon that attaches his hamstring to his lower left leg on Monday. He is expected to miss six weeks of action due to the procedure.    Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Ismail (knee) returned to action on Monday night against Washington. He finished with three catches for 50 yards, but didn't make much of an impact Fantasy-wise.    Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Sunday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI -! M! atty Updated 10/16/01 Pittman suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, and was dealing with headaches on Monday as a result. He is expected to undergo tests, and is status for Sunday's game against Kansas City will be determined later in the week. If he is unable to play, Thomas Jones would step into the No. 1 RB role once again.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/16/01 Moss is dealing with a sprained right ankle, which may keep him from playing at full capacity this weekend against Green Bay. It's tough to ever bench Moss, but considering his recent struggles, it might not be a bad idea if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Doug Chapman , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/16/01 Chapman is expected to get the starting nod this weekend against Green Bay due to Michael Bennett's ankle injury. Chapman may be worth picking up for the week in deeper leagues, but he'll be hard-pressed to put up good numbers against a solid Packers' defense.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/16/01 According to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Bennett (ankle) is expected to miss this weekend's game against Green Bay. He was wearing a protective boot on Monday and was walking with a noticeable limp. Doug Chapman will likely get the start in Bennett's absence.

Western Power Prices Continue To Fall Amid Increased Supply

     Los Angeles, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead power
prices continued to fall today for Thursday parcels, as supply
continues to out-strip supply, traders said.
     The California Independent System Operator reported 6,247.89
megawatts of generation that was curtailed in California for
planned and unplanned maintenance, a decline of 49.9 percent from
a month ago.
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
slipped $8.00 a megawatt-hour to $52.00 amid trades at $49.00-
$60.00.  Off-Peak power fell $1.61, with trades completed from
$30.00-$35.00.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services
Corp., temperatures in San Francisco were expected to peak today
at 70 degrees Fahrenheit and fall 3 degrees tomorrow to 67
degrees.
     Forecasters expect temperatures in the Pacific Northwest
would average 4.3 degrees below normal and remain normal in the
Southwest over the next 6-10 days.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power declined 30.6 percent from yesterday, with trades completed
at $50.00-$55.00, to a Bloomberg index at $52.25.
     ""Prices are continuing to fall as dams are still generating
electricity from mountain run-off and generation is looking
healthier in California, topped with normal weather conditions,''
said one Northwest trader.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California peak
power declined $14.46 to a Bloomberg index low for the year at
$64.27, with sales completed at $54.00-$85.00, a decline of 84.2
percent from the average price for electricity during the week of
May 7.
     In the Southwest, power prices sank an average of $13.03 at
the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $78.65 amid
trades in the $62.00-$105.00 range.
     Traders said they don't expect prices to remain this low.
Eventually power prices will firm up. There will be no more
snowmelt and temperatures will increase.

PJM Spot Power Prices Rise With Higher Marginal Pool Rates

     Philadelphia, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Next-day power
prices in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection
rose again today on continued support from higher locational
marginal pool rates, traders said.
     While technical problems with the PJM software application
made LMPs unavailable during this morning's trading session,
traders said $40 prices seen yesterday afternoon were substantial
enough to carry through previous gains.
     Repairs to the ""eSuite"" system later revealed morning peaks
as high as $35.00, and an overnight spike of $107.00.
     On-peak power scheduled for Thursday delivery to the Western
Hub of PJM was assessed at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of
$28.85 per megawatt hour, up $1.25 from yesterday.
     Today's move marked the fourth consecutive increase in day-
ahead values, though cumulative gains amounted to only $5.22, or
22.1 percent.
     Some marketers suggested prices were pushed higher to serve
as a cushion against an expected pull from today's American Gas
Association storage report, rather than as a function of
fundamental drivers.
     Analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg estimated on
average that U.S. working natural gas inventories increased 98
billion cubic feet during the week ended June 1. Estimates ranged
from 85 to 115 billion cubic feet injected.
     ""A lot of people are anticipating a triple-digit injection
number,"" said one Northeast power trader. ""Electricity has been
very closely tied to natural gas these past couple of weeks. So if
that number does in fact come in as high as expected, it's going
to have a bearish effect that will ripple throughout the power
markets.""
     In the over-the-counter market, next-week packages sold $3.00
higher on revised weather forecasts. Parcels for June 11-15 were
discussed at $40.00-$41.00, compared to $37.00-$38.00 yesterday.
According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast will average 4.9 degrees Fahrenheit
above normal over the next 6-10 days. The weather forecaster
predicted yesterday, temperatures for the equivalent period would
average 2.4 degrees below normal.
     New England and New York day-ahead prices also moved higher,
though traders couldn't identify any fundamental reasons that
might have prompted those increases.
     ""Gains made in New York and New England have to be financial,
possibly an attempt to narrow the spreads to PJM,"" one trader
said. ""Next week should bring with it some warmer weather, but
there's absolutely nothing bullish about tomorrow's forecast.""
     New England dailies were assessed 35 cents higher at an index
price of $35.90, while New York's Zones A and G were valued 88
cents and $1.70 higher, respectively, at $30.13 and $42.00
indices.

Midwest Power Prices Rise With Transmission Concerns, Weather

     Cincinnati, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day power
prices climbed today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as transmission
constraints surfaced in the East Central Area Reliability Council
and warmer weather was forecast in the southern Plains.
     ECAR traders said Transmission Line Loading Relief (TLR)
measures, which began in several areas this morning because of
the large amount of power being moved south from yesterday's
transactions, drove up hourly and day-ahead prices on concerns
they could continue tomorrow.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Thursday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system climbed
$4.10 to $27.31 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $26.50
up to $28.00.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, prices for
peak power at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub rose in
line with the Cinergy market, up $3.81 on average at $26.50-
$28.50. Power in lower MAIN sold $3.50 higher at $26.50-$34.00.
     MAIN traders said the ComEd market tracked prices at the
Cinergy hub and should continue to do so into next week, since
warmer weather was expected in Cincinnati than in Chicago.
     In the over-the-counter market, short-term prices rose today
as weather forecasts were revised warmer. Cinergy parcels for
delivery from June 11-15 were offered at $41.50, up from $37.25
late yesterday.
     Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted
high temperatures in Cincinnati would average 5 degrees
Fahrenheit above normal 6-10 days from now, compared to 2 degrees
below normal for that period yesterday.
     ""Next week's still overvalued, even if it does warm up,"" one
ECAR trader said. ""The entire market's long, and it'd have to be
over 85 for a week or so to see any heat buildup. I think $35 is
more than likely where dailies will be, not $40.""
     Day-ahead peak power prices also rose in the Mid-Continent
Area Power Pool, trading up $1.66 in northern MAPP at $20.00-
$27.00 and up $2.37 at $24.00-$27.00 in the southern half of the
region.
     MAPP traders said forecasts for temperatures to reach 80
degrees in Nebraska pulled southern prices up, while sales to the
south and the higher-priced eastern hub markets pulled northern
values higher.
     They said the market could move up again tomorrow if
temperatures reach expected levels in southern MAPP.

Most Southeast Power Prices Rise With Warmer Weather

     Nashville, Tennessee, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most U.S.
Southeast spot electricity prices for delivery tomorrow rose
because of increased weather-related demand, traders said.
     Electricity parcels for delivery into the Tennessee Valley
Authority transmission grid traded at $27.00-$29.00 a megawatt-
hour, with the Bloomberg index price up $3.15 to $28.00.
     According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington
Massachusetts, temperatures in Nashville were forecasted to peak
at 86 degrees Fahrenheit today and 83 degrees tomorrow.
     Forecasters predict temperatures in the Southeast to be 2.4
degrees above normal over the next 6-10 days.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price increased
$1.38 a megawatt-hour from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$34.84 amid trades at $26.75-$29.00.
     ""Prices are increasing as temperatures are rising causing
air conditioning load to boost,'' said one Southeast trader.
     On the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. grid, peak power for
Wednesday delivery traded at $33.60-$35.00 and averaged $34.11,
42 cents higher than yesterday.
     In the Southern section of the Southwest Power Pool, peak
power increased $4.00 to a Bloomberg index of $32.00, with sales
completed at $31.00-$33.00.

U.K. Spot Power Prices Drop as Major Players Sell Contracts

     London, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K
fell today on robust selling by several major players, traders
said.
     Day-ahead baseload was assessed at 17.50 pounds a megawatt-
hour, which was down 1.25 pounds or almost 7 percent from
yesterday.
     Although the majors sold contracts at lower levels, traders
reported strong buying support at those prices, preventing prices
from falling further.
     Weekend baseload power traded four times today between 16.60-
16.80 a megawatt hour, down 40 pence from yesterday.
     Winter 2001 electricity traded actively from the start of
trade, falling steadily from this morning at 21.57 pounds to 21.53
pounds, before dropping to trade at 21.40 pounds a megawatt hour
this afternoon.

Nordic Power Closes at Record Highs on Winter Supply Worries

     Lysaker, Norway, June 6 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
seasonal contract prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,
Norway, reached record highs today following renewed buying
interest for seasonal structures because of expected hydro-supply
shortages next winter, traders said.
     Winter-2, 2001 closed at an all-time high of 222.00 Norwegian
kroner a megawatt-hour after 394.00 megawatts were exchanged, up
1.50 kroner. Winter-1, 2002 jumped 3.50 kroner to close at a
record high of 227.50 kroner a megawatt hour, with 203.00
megawatts traded.
     ""Yesterday the market sent a very clear technical buying
signal when year 2002 contracts closed at an all-time high of
191.75 kroner a megawatt-hour,'' a trader said, adding expected
winter supply shortages were affecting prices of yearly
structures.
     Today, year 2002 forwards rose further to a new record high
of 194.00 kroner a megawatt-hour, up 2.25 kroner.
     The larger gain by winter-1, 2002 than that of winter-2, 2001
came after worries of limited hydro-supply shifted from the last 3
months of 2001 to the first 4 months of 2002, a Trondheim, Norway-
based trader said earlier today.
     While abundant precipitation between September and November
could offset the limited effect that scarce snowmelt has had on
reservoirs this year, participants remained concerned that
increased power consumption for space heating between January and
April would render hydro-supply insufficient.
     On May 4, winter-2, 2001 closed at 206 kroner a megawatt-
hour, 1 kroner higher than winter-1, 2002, which closed at 205
kroner a megawatt-hour. ""The spread between the 2 winter contracts
has now reversed from an unusual situation where winter-2, 2001
was valued higher than winter-1, 2002 a few week ago,'' another
trader said.
     Across Scandinavia, rainfall was forecast to remain above
average over the next 5 days, according to Weather Services Corp.
in the U.S. Still, actual precipitation was unlikely to even reach
normal levels, traders said.
     At the end of week 22, Norwegian dams rose in line with
expectations by 4.5 percent to 46.8 percent of total capacity,
equivalent to 38,265 gigawatt-hours generation, compared to 63.5
percent of total capacity or 51,918 gigawatt-hours at the same
time last year, according to Statistics Norway.
     Swedish reservoirs climbed 3.5 percent at the end of week 22,
to 49.8 of total capacity, compared to 61.9 percent a year ago,
according to the Swedish Power Association.
     Thursday's spot price unexpectedly rose 8.96 kroner to 222.83
kroner a megawatt-hour ""because producers wanted to show that they
were presently in control of prices,'' a trader said.
Still, producers were reported ""comfortable'' selling at

*********************************************

Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. Online Mortgages: Appraising the Options
(Retail e-Financial Services Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=799

For most individuals, a mortgage is likely to be the largest loan they ever incur. For this reason, it is not hard to imagine why, to date, many mortgage seekers have hesitated to use the Internet as a channel for loan origination. Concerns about the validity of data, use of a new technology, and security contribute to this hesitancy. However, with mortgage interest rates near 30-year lows and consumers refinancing existing mortgages at high levels, the current economic conditions have created a positive environment for online mortgage lending to flourish. This report describes four potential business models a financial institution may adopt when implementing its own Internet strategy for mortgage lending.


2. Electronic Invoice Presentment and Payment: The Key to Lockbox
(Wholesale e-Financial Services access)
(e-Payments Client access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=800

Banks have traditionally handled the collection and processing of remittance information and payments for their corporate customers through physical lockbox facilities. Corporations, however, are increasingly moving their payment function online. In the process, they are losing the paper-bound connection of payment to remittance; now they are looking for ways to keep their collection information integrated with their billing information. Electronic invoice presentment and payment (EIPP) is one solution to their problem, and it brings both challenges and opportunities to banks. While EIPP does threaten the lockbox revenues of banks, it offers them the means to expand their involvement in their customers' payment and collection processes by completing the invoice-payment-remittance-settlement cycle. This report explores the roles that exist for banks in the EIPP space and the strategies they can employ as they look for ways to continue serving their corporate customers.


3. Invest in Wireless Payments
A Meridien/FSTC report (Meridien clients - all services - only)
http://www.meridien-research.com/misc/fstc/invest_in_wireless_payments.asp
Financial institutions and mobile telecommunications firms in Europe and Asia are already introducing wireless payment capability. We see opportunities in the United States as well for financial institutions and telcos to work together to develop wireless payment solutions that can both meet corporate goals and address the structural issues existing in the American wireless environment. Telcos are now urgently assessing strategies to attain profitability; wireless payments are a key element to meet that goal. Financial institutions that act quickly can participate as new wireless payment capabilities are developed, thereby ensuring that solutions also meet the needs of their industry and their customers.

Subject:	SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY

From Inside FERC (Oct. 8th)--pls let me know if you want more detail or would like to see the FERC filing.  Will keep you posted as the project progresses through FERC.

Suzanne
============================================================================================================
SOUTHERN NATURAL FILES $245 MILLION PROPOSAL TO BOOST CAPACITY
To serve local distributors, industrial users and power generators, Southern Natural Gas Co. filed with FERC last week to build $245 million worth of compression, pipeline looping and other facilities to transport a total of 359,891 Mcf/day. The project would be constructed in two phases.

The expansion would start moving 320,714 Mcf/day by June 1, 2003, said the Oct. 1 application (CP02-1 et. al.). In the project's second phase, Southern Natural would install additional facilities to move 39,177 Mcf/day by May 1, 2004. Phase one includes 114.5 miles of looping in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, which would be built in 11 segments that range in length from 3.41 miles to 16.74 miles. Pipe diameters would range from 24 inches to 36 inches. Phase two includes 8.8 miles of 30-inch-diameter looping in Georgia that would be
constructed in two segments of 4.8 miles and 4.0 miles.

Southern Natural proposed installing a total of 76,930 horsepower of compression, of which 11,280 hp would replace existing compression facilities that have deteriorated or otherwise become obsolete. Phase one includes ten compression units ranging in size from 3,550 hp to 15,000 hp. Under phase two, one 4,730 hp unit would be installed. Furthermore, Southern Natural proposed abandoning six compressors that generate a total of 9,930 hp.

All 359,891 Mcf/day of the capacity has been subscribed, the application said. During an open season held between Dec. 15 and Jan. 26, firm service agreements were reached with Southern Co.

Southern Natural asked FERC to allow it to roll in the cost of the expansion in its next rate proceeding ""based on the considerable benefit to the overall rates of existing customers."" Revenues generated from the new contracts are expected to exceed project costs by approximately $154 million, thus the expansion would result in ""a significant benefit"" to current shippers, Southern Natural said. In addition to the financial benefits, existing shippers will enjoy operational benefits as well, said the pipeline. ""The combination of additional compression and new loop pipeline represents a significant enhancement to system reliability for all shippers delivering gas"" in Southern Natural's market area, the
application said. Furthermore, Southern Natural promised that service to existing shippers would not be degraded as a result of the project.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 27, 2001

TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) continues to operate
under the Critical System Warning issued November 26, 2001.  Based on
anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated below,
Texas Eastern is requiring that all customers take immediate and prompt
steps to eliminate excess receipts and conform scheduled receipts to
actual deliveries. This system-wide warning is issued as a result of
actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries. This Critical System Warning shall remain in place until
further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or line pack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Due to the critical nature of this situation, and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition, and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV","Monday February 4, 9:07 am Eastern Time 
Press Release
SOURCE: Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. 
Maritimes Files Application for Phase IV Expansion Of Natural Gas Pipeline System
BOSTON, Feb. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C. has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to further expand its natural gas pipeline system. The $250 million expansion project, designated Phase IV, will allow Maritimes to nearly double its capacity to transport natural gas from offshore Nova Scotia to markets in the northeastern United States from approximately 415,000 dekatherms to 800,000 dekatherms per day. 
Demand for natural gas, especially in New England and the Northeast, continues to increase at a rapid rate. Maritimes received substantial requests for transportation services from local natural gas distribution companies, natural gas-fired electric generators and third-party marketers during a recently completed open season nominations period, emphasizing the market's desire for more natural gas from Atlantic Canada. 
``The demand for natural gas is real, and it is significant,'' said Tom O'Connor, president of M&N Management Co., the managing member of Maritimes. ``Maritimes is able to respond to the demand by efficiently and economically expanding its system to deliver new supplies of gas from fields off Canada's east coast. Access to additional sources of this cleaner-burning fuel will ensure greater energy reliability and flexibility for the northeast region.'' 
Earlier this year, Maritimes signed agreements with PanCanadian Energy Services Inc. to transport up to approximately 400 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from PanCanadian's Deep Panuke project, offshore Nova Scotia. The Phase IV expansion project will accommodate the increased volumes of gas. 
The Phase IV expansion complements the planned extension of the Maritimes pipeline from Methuen to Beverly, Mass. The extension -- Phase III of the Maritimes project -- will interconnect the 650-mile Maritimes pipeline with Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.'s 1,000-mile system through Algonquin's proposed HubLine project. The Maritimes Phase III and Algonquin HubLine projects recently received final approval from FERC. 
The Phase IV project proposes to construct four compressor stations in Maine each with approximately 26,800 horsepower of additional compression and approximately 31.3 miles of additional pipeline loop facilities in Maine's Washington County. The new compressor stations are proposed to be located in the municipalities of Eliot, Gorham, Brewer and Searsmont. Maritimes recently held open houses in these communities to provide information on the proposed expansion. 
``We will work closely with federal, state and municipal officials as well as landowners and stakeholders throughout the FERC process to ensure the project is designed and constructed with minimal impact to communities and the environment,'' said Bill Penney, senior vice president and general manager of Maritimes. ``As we proceed with the Phase IV expansion, Maritimes will continue its solid record of environmental, safety and operational compliance.'' 
In addition to the FERC application, Maritimes will submit applications to other appropriate federal and state agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Coastal Zone Management and Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The Phase IV expansion is expected to be in service in 2004. 
Maritimes is owned by affiliates of Duke Energy (37.5 percent); Westcoast Energy, Inc. (37.5 percent); ExxonMobil (12.5 percent); and Emera Inc. (12.5 percent). For more information, contact Maritimes on the Internet at www.mnp-usa.com <http://www.mnp-usa.com>.

Subject: TE Request for TABS-2 Assistance


November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Western Power Prices Fall to Yearly Low on Increased Supply

     Los Angeles, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead power
prices sank to their lowest levels in nearly a year throughout
the Western U.S. today because of increased generation and cooler
weather.
     Spot values at seven delivery points surveyed by the
Bloomberg Energy Service in the Western System Coordinating
Council fell to their lowest levels since July. Last July, prices
were lower because additional supply became available when the
Bonneville Power Administration re-entered the day-ahead market,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
slumped $39.77 a megawatt-hour to $60.00 amid trades at $55.00-
$65.00, a decline of 75.9 percent from a month ago.
     ""Prices are crashing today as more generation is becoming
available to the grid, with the restart of San Onofre-3 and
Diablo, increased hydroelectricity, and cooler temperatures,''
said one Northwest marketer.
     Traders said continued mountain run-off into the reservoirs
is causing dam operators to generate electricity to prevent
spilling water over the dam.
     Reservoir data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shows
that at 1,277 feet, water levels at the Grand Coulee Dam are
about 98.99 percent of capacity. Last July, water levels were
1,283 feet.
     Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s 1,100-megawatt Diablo Canyon-2
nuclear plant located in Avila Beach, California, was confirmed
to be operating at 100 percent capacity, company officials said.
     ""With Diablo returning to the grid and yesterday San Onofre-
3 returning, that's totaling almost 2,200 megawatts,'' said one
Southwest trader.
     Southern California Edison's San Onofre 3 nuclear plant's
output reached 100 percent yesterday after it restarted June 1.
The plant shut Feb. 3 when an electrical fire damaged a turbine.
     At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California peak
power declined 65.23 percent from a month ago to Bloomberg index
low for the year at $78.73, with sales completed at $60.00-
$92.00.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power declined 68.6 percent from a month ago with trades
completed at $58.00-$90.00, to a Bloomberg index at $75.27.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services
Corp., temperatures in San Francisco were expected to peak today
at 67 degrees Fahrenheit and rise 2 degrees tomorrow.
     Forecasters expect temperatures in the Pacific Northwest
would average 3.9 degrees below normal and 1.1 degrees above
normal in the Southwest over the next 6-10 days.
     In the Southwest, power prices sank an average of $37.28 at
the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $91.68 amid
trades in the $80.00-$102.00 range.
     Traders said they don't expect prices to remain this low.
Eventually there will be no more snow melt and temperatures will
increase, which will cause demand to out-strip supply and prices
to increase, they said.

PJM Spot Power Prices Rise With Elevated Pool Rates, Unit Loss

     Philadelphia, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) -- For the first time
in three weeks, day-ahead power prices at the Western Hub of the
Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection rose in excess of
$1.00, pushed higher by elevated pool rates, traders said.
     Locational marginal prices for the four hours leading up to
daily options expiration, or 10 a.m. local time, averaged $29.28
per megawatt hour today, compared to $20.63 yesterday. While LMPs
peaked at only $46.00 during the four-hour period, they reached as
high as $100.00 during the hour ending 9 p.m. last night.
     Traders speculated the $100.00 spike was prompted by an
unplanned unit outage, though none were confirmed.
     ""I suspect PJM lost something unexpectedly,"" said one PJM-
based trader. ""The day-ahead clearing price came in at around
$25.00 yesterday, and the LMPs have been averaging quite a bit
higher than that. I'd be hard pressed to believe that last night's
price spike was caused by a technical glitch.""
     One trader said units were indeed brought off-line, but not
unexpectedly. To quell the Minimum Generation Alerts issued by PJM
over the past five days, one generator opted to power down two of
its older coal plants, he said.
     Peak power scheduled for Wednesday delivery was assessed at a
Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $27.60, up $1.80 from yesterday
and near parity with the week-ago price of $27.95.
In the over-the-counter market, balance-of-the-week and next
week packages sold up on revised weather forecasts, which are
calling for higher temperatures than originally anticipated.
Traders reported June 7-8 parcels as high as $27.00, and June 11-
15 parcels up to $40.50.
According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast U.S. will average 2.4 degrees
Fahrenhiet below normal over the next seven days, and 1.3 degrees
below normal over the next 6-10 days. Yesterday, the company
predicted temperatures would average 4.0 and 4.1 degrees below
normal for the respective periods.
""It's not exactly a bullish outlook,"" one trader said of the
forecast. ""I'd call it less bearish, at best. The market's so
depressed that less bearish is about all it takes to get things
moving.""
     Prices continued to fall in the New York and New England
Power Pools, amid scant demand and excess supply. New York's Zones
A and G fell 50 and 45 cents, respectively, to $40.30 and $29.25
indices. In New England, a 2,706-megawatt capacity surplus caused
spot values there to fall $1.55 to an average price of $35.55, and
the lowest daily index posted since April 2000.

ECAR, MAIN Power Prices Climb With Increased Southeast Demand

     Cincinnati, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak
power prices rose today in the East Central Area Reliability
Council and Mid-America Interconnected Network regions amid
demand from the Southeast, traders said.
     They said news of an outage at South Carolina Electric & Gas
Co.'s 1,000-megawatt Summer 1 reactor and temperatures forecast
in the mid-80s degrees led ECAR and MAIN marketers to sell excess
power south, pushing prices up in early trading.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Wednesday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system climbed
$1.82 to $23.21 a megawatt-hour, trading from $22.00-$24.00 for
most of the morning.
     In MAIN, for-Wednesday power at the Chicago-based
Commonwealth Edison hub sold $1.02 higher on average at $22.00-
$23.00 early.
     However, traders said low local demand and recent soft
prices led marketers to oversell, driving spot prices up to
$26.00 at Cinergy and $25.00 at the ComEd hub after options
expiration.
     ""We definitely saw a short squeeze late. With the market
being slow for so long, people got a bit excited and oversold
stuff to the south,"" an ECAR trader said.
     Short-term over-the-counter prices in ECAR and MAIN fell
today, with power for delivery from June 11-15 offered at $38.50
at Cinergy and $39.30 at ComEd. Traders said a reduced
possibility of warmer weather caused the decline and the market
should fall further as forecasts became more certain.
     ""If no heat comes in, the market for next week's going to
crash, for sure,"" one trader said. ""Most of the market's been
long and wrong, and is trying to do something about that, but I
don't think it's going to materialize.""
     In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, peak next-day power
prices were little changed again today as cool weather continued
to blanket the region and there was little demand for power
elsewhere, traders said.
     For-Wednesday parcels sold at $18.00-$22.00 in the northern
half of the region and at $20.00-$27.00 in southern MAPP, up 17
and 13 cents from yesterday on average, respectively.
     Traders said the market could rise next week if warmer
weather arrives as expected.
     In its 6-10 forecast, Belton, Missouri-based Weather
Derivatives Inc. predicted temperatures would average 2 degrees
above normal, up from 1 degree below normal over the next week.

Most Southeast Power Prices Rise With Weather-Related Demand

     Atlanta, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) - Most U.S. Southeast
spot electricity prices for delivery tomorrow rose because of
increased weather-related demand, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price increased
$1.42 a megawatt-hour from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$33.46 amid trades at $24.00-$53.00.
     ""Heat is coming in from the Midwest, which is causing prices
to rise,'' said one Southeast trader.
     In the Northern section of the Southwest Power Pool, peak
power increased 83 cents to a Bloomberg index of $22.00, with
sales completed at $21.00-$23.00.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services
Corp., temperatures in Dallas were expected to peak today at 91
degrees Fahrenheit and decline two degrees tomorrow to 89
degrees.
     In the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, ""UB'' firm
power sold for tomorrow at $38.00-$39.50, gaining 13 cents from
yesterday to a Bloomberg index at $38.63.
     ""Rain is expected in Texas, which should cause prices to
decline (tomorrow),'' said one Southeast trader.
     Forecasters predict temperatures in the Southeast will
remain close to normal levels over the next seven days.
     On the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. grid, peak power for
Wednesday delivery traded at $32.75-$35.00 and averaged $33.69,
$3.04 higher than yesterday.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak next-day parcels at the
Florida-Georgia border increased $2.00 to a Bloomberg index at
$52.00 with trades completed at $50.00-$53.00.
     ""Temperatures are high in the Florida markets causing air
conditioning load to increase,"" said one Southeast marketer.

U.K. Spot Power Prices Climb on Continued Outage Rumors

     London, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. spot power prices
rose for a second consecutive day amid continued rumors of an
outage at the Connah's Quay power plant, traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload power traded as low as 18.00 pounds a
megawatt-hour, before rising to 18.75 pounds a megawatt-hour, 25
pence higher than yesterday's close.
     This morning, buying interest was high as rumors persisted
that Connah's Quay, Powergen's 1,400-megawatt combined-cycle gas
turbine power plant, closed because of technical problems, traders
said. Unconfirmed reports of the outage yesterday pushed day-ahead
baseload prices up 1.50 pounds to 18.50 pounds.
     One trader said he was skeptical of the rumors of the plant
outage, though.
""I don't think Connah's Quay is down; there were no different
buyers out there today,"" the trader said. ""People bought up this
morning, scared by the rumors and worried there'd be no sellers
left out there but there was actually around 400 megawatts left
today.""
By midday, though, activity was scant, traders said.
     ""We tried to sell, and there were no bids,"" another trader
said.
     Week 24 traded 60 pence higher at 17.75 pounds a megawatt-
hour.
     Seasonal contracts remained little changed for the fifth
consecutive day amid lackluster activity, traders said.
     Winter 2001 last traded at 21.58 pounds a megawatt-hour, 1
pence lower than yesterday.

Nordic Electricity Prices Close Mixed on Weather Uncertainty

     Lysaker, Norway, June 5 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed
mixed today because wetter-than-normal weather forecasts were
offset by concern that actual precipitation would remain around
average levels, traders said.
     Week 24 was the most heavily traded contract today with
385.00 megawatts exchanged between 207.50-210.00 Norwegian kroner
a megawatt-hour, down 0.50 kroner. Week 25 closed down 1.25 kroner
at 205.75 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     ""Weather forecasts can't be taken straightforwardly;
adjustments are always necessary to assess prices,'' a trader
said.
     Although Scandinavian precipitation over the last four days
was forecast 2.0 terawatt-hours above normal, actual rainfall was
0.5 terawatt-hours below normal, raising concerns of unexpectedly
low hydro-supply this week, an Oslo-based trader said earlier
today.
     Water supply worries pushed Wednesday's system area average
price 5.35 kroner higher than today's price to 213.87 kroner a
megawatt-hour, in line with expectations.
     While a national holiday in Denmark today kept industrial
demand at a minimum, tomorrow's expected consumption increase
contributed to a higher spot price, another trader said.
     In the longer-term, winter-2, 2001 closed little changed at
220.50 kroner a megawatt-hour with 128.00 megawatts exchanged.
     Limited trade on longer-term structures came after
participants distanced themselves from an uncertain market,
awaiting further weather signals, traders said.
     Nordpool's total trade volumes amounted to 1,317 gigawatt-
hours generation, compared with Friday's 1,292 gigawatt-hours.

STRONG BUY
Target Price: 25.00 (US$)
Enron Corp. (ENE)
10Q Info Consistent With Plusses For DYN In Deal

Summary

ENE filed its 3Q'01 10Q last night with information ranging from updates on
accounting restatements, balance sheet details and discussions of off-balance
sheet obligations.

Important disclosures were made related to acceleration of debt repayment due to
recent credit rating downgrades, reduced 4Q'01 eps expectations and liquidity.

ENE has $690 million in debt due on Nov 27 because of recent downgrades. We
expect this obligation to be renegotiated, satisfied out of the current cash
position of $1.5 billion or collateralized.

A reduction in 4Q'01 eps expectations because of ENE issues and other items was
part of our recent estimate reduction from $0.48 to $0.40 for 4Q'01, (before
non-
recurring items) discussed in a report dated Nov 5, 2001. We now expect 4Q eps
to be in a $0.25-$0.35 range.

Also in the 10Q, ENE describes other items discussed in the conference call of
Nov 14 including $8 billion of ""non-core"" (principally international and
broadband assets) that are for sale, an ability to issue $2 billion of
additional equity before the Dynegy (DYN, 43.60, Strong Buy) deal closes and a
total debt balance of $16.3 billion ($13.0 ""on balance sheet"" and $3.3 billion
""off balance sheet"").

The ""material adverse change (MAC)"" clause in the DYN/ENE deal was described as
considered if other ENE liabilities (primarily litigation) exceed $2 billion net
of insurance or reserves. If an additional $1.5 billion in liabilities is
assessed a MAC is deemed to have occurred.

In assessing a 90% probability that the DYN/ENE deal will be completed, we note
that ENE is not a going concern without it, DYN demonstrably benefits by it
(please see report dated Nov 9,'01) and Chevron/Texaco (CVX, 82.91) supports it.
In our view, positive comments by CVX yesterday, and the $1.5 billion cash
infusion to ENE from CVX on Nov 13, add to the support shown for the deal.

We continue to rate DYN Strong Buy because of its earnings and valuation upside
potential in this deal. Our current eps est for DYN of $2.55 for '02 moves to
$3.25 or higher with a completed deal. Our DYN target price of $54 is subject to
upward revision as well. For ENE, our Strong Buy rating expects that the deal
spread, currently about 30% will narrow as progress is made toward a closing.

The author's immediate family owns less than 250 shares of ENE.

"Re-start/Integration Planning","We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans ""Re-start/Integration""  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Williams: MarketLink Phase 1 Is Open for Business 
Williams said Wednesday that it has completed the first phase of the Transco pipeline system's MarketLink expansion project, which will provide much needed incremental natural gas transportation capacity into the northeastern United States. The company added that this project represents the first interstate pipeline expansion completed to serve the New York metropolitan area since 1992. 
""Williams Gas Pipeline-Transco has provided reliable, economic gas transportation services to the Northeast for over 50 years and is committed to meeting the growing energy requirements in the region,"" said Gary Lauderdale, senior vice president and general manager, Williams' Transco pipeline. ""This area, which includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, continues to experience a need for additional natural gas to serve residential, commercial and power generation facilities. MarketLink will help meet this need."" 
The MarketLink project, which received the go-ahead from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on April 26, 2000, is being constructed in two phases. The first phase was completed and entered into service on Wednesday. It will deliver an incremental 166,000 Dth/d of natural gas. The second phase of the project, which will be placed in service in November 2002, will deliver an additional 130,000 Dth/d to the region. 
""Phase 1 of MarketLink will provide much needed capacity to the region in time for the winter heating season,"" said Mario DiCocco, Williams' Transco pipeline director of operations for the Princeton division, which covers New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. ""We will begin construction of Phase II next spring."" 
Williams pointed out that there are more than a dozen new gas-fueled power plants currently in the permitting process in New Jersey alone. Gas transported by MarketLink is expected to fuel new efficient power plants that are needed to meet the region's growing electricity needs and help meet Clean Air Act standards

Islander East Receives FERC's Preliminary Determination 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a preliminary determination on non-environmental issues to the Islander East Pipeline Co. LLC to build a 40-mile pipeline that will bring natural gas from Connecticut to Long Island, NY. 
Duke Energy Gas Transmission (DEGT) and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island (KEDLI) first announced its plans for the proposed line in January.  The proposed pipeline project will be equally owned by the two companies under Islander East Pipeline LLC. 
Originating from DEGT's Algonquin Gas Transmission's system, the pipeline --- made from 24-inch and 30-inch diameter pipe --- would extend from Connecticut across Long Island Sound to Wading River, NY, and other points on Long Island, where it would connect with KEDLI. The companies believe the time is right for Islander East because it would have access to almost every major supply basin in North America, including the recently developed Sable Island off the coast of Nova Scotia in Atlantic Canada. Its backers said it would be possible through Algonquin's proposed interconnection with Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline. 
The companies said that they expect to have the pipeline operating in 2003, initially providing 250,000 Dth/d of natural gas to the Long Island and New York City energy markets, enough to heat 600,000 homes. 
However, the Islander East project is not the only game in town. Following the Islander announcement, El Paso Corp.'s Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co. revealed a project that would provide up to 450,000 Dth/d of new transportation capacity from the company's interconnection with joint facilities of Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline LLC. and Portland Natural Gas Transmission System Co. in Dracut, MA, and terminate in Suffolk County on eastern Long Island.
Tennessee said its project will deliver to various local distribution companies and their facilities, including Yankee Gas Services, Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas and KeySpan Energy Delivery Long Island, as well as directly to proposed power generating plants along the way. 
Also throwing its hat into the ring back in April, Iroquois Gas Transmission System LP announced an open season yesterday for Zone 2 firm transportation capacity for delivery on its proposed Eastern Long Island Expansion.
Iroquois proposes to construct 20 miles of 24-inch diameter marine pipeline from Milford, CT, to Shoreham, Long Island, and points farther inland as the market demands.

Maritimes Phase III, HubLine, Iroquois' Eastchester Receive Final FERC Nods 
FERC issued final certificates Wednesday morning to the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline Phase III expansion project and related HubLine expansion by Algonquin Gas Transmission. The integrated expansions will increase transportation of Atlantic Canadian gas to the Boston area. In addition, Iroquois' Eastchester project received a final green light from FERC. The $174 million Eastchester project will add 230,000 Dth/d of capacity to the Iroquois system to increase deliveries mainly to New York City power generators. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission denied rolled-in rate treatment for Eastchester, stating that, contrary to Iroquois' claims, the project's cost actually would exceed its revenues, requiring existing firm shippers to subsidize a portion of the project. Iroquois had said the project would provide $2.8 million in annual net financial benefits, but FERC found that it actually would cost existing shippers $2.9 million. As a result, the Commission left the rates to be settled in a future proceeding. 
The 33-mile pipeline extension will connect Iroquois' existing system in Suffolk County with Consolidated Edison's system in the Bronx. Iroquois hopes to complete the extension by November 2002. It signed 10-year precedent agreements for the capacity with five shippers: Virginia Power Energy Marketing (20,000 Dth/d), Mirant New York Management (60,000), KeySpan Ravenswood (60,000), Consolidated Edison Energy (30,000) and Orion Power Holdings (60,000). ConEd, KeySpan and Orion will use their capacity to serve power generation load. FERC also said the pipeline must finalize its agreements with shippers prior to moving forward with construction. 
Iroquois Gas Transmission System is a partnership of 10 U.S. and Canadian energy firms and is owner of a 375-mile interstate pipeline extending from the U.S.-Canadian border at Waddington, NY, through western Connecticut to Long Island, NY. 
The companion expansion projects of Maritimes & Northeast and Algonquin call for Maritimes to construct an extension in a southeasterly direction through several Massachusetts counties to the East Coast where a new Algonquin line would connect and extend offshore down the coast through Boston Bay to a connection with Algonquin's existing system at Weymouth on the south side of Boston Harbor. The two pipeline projects are designed to supply up to 230,500 Dth/d to the gas-starved New England region and are targeted for service by November 2002. 
The so-called Phase III extension of the 600-mile Maritimes pipeline, which imports Atlantic Canadian gas to the Northeast from the Sable Offshore Energy Project offshore Nova Scotia, will include 24 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline and one mile of 24-inch diameter pipeline, extending from Methuen, MA, through a number of counties to a connection with Algonquin's proposed extension in Beverly, MA. The project, which has an estimated price tag of $133.9 million, would provide firm transportation service to serve growing markets on the east end of Algonquin's system. 
Algonquin's HubLine project, which has a projected cost of $127 million, will include about 29 miles of 24-inch diameter pipeline, extending offshore from an interconnection near Beverly with Maritimes' proposed Phase III project to an interconnection with Algonquin's existing I-9 lateral in Weymouth. Algonquin also plans to build a 5.4-mile, 16-inch diameter lateral from the proposed pipeline to a wastewater treatment plant owned by Massachusetts Water Resources Authority on Deer Island.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income.

"Picnic Table","Barry: Sorry to hear you have been sick. Hope you are feeling better.
We have no plans to be up this week end, but we are discussing a work day
for a week end soon.
You are welcome to use the picnic table this week end or anytime.
I submitted the estimate of damages to the District Attoney's office soon
after I asked you for it, but haven't heard anything on the final outcome of
the case.

"American Heart Walk","Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

"Chris Ordway Promotion","Initially, Chris Ordway was assigned to schedule Dominion and Iroquois pipelines.  Now, after quickly mastering those two pipelines with their associated responsibilities, he is scheduling TETCO's market area and production area as part of a two person scheduling team.  Chris has quickly learned the gas business and has adapted easily to change.  He's been able to prioritize his workload and meet all scheduling deadlines as well as our weekly and monthly accounting deadlines. He has a strong desire to learn more about the company and has made personal sacrifices to make sure his work gets done correctly the first time.  I am very impressed at the speed at which he mastered our trading system, Sitara and our nominations system, UNIFY.  He has also now familiarized himself with 3 pipeline EBB's  (NRG, Escript and Link) as well.  He streamlined various pathing processes on Dominion and corrected  volume management issues on Dominion surrounding metered production.  From a commercial perspective, the traders are impressed with his sense of urgency during trading, his adaptability to change directions in mid-stream and his ability to explore better economic options while scheduling gas on either Dominion, Iroquois or TETCO. Chris is very quick and forthcoming with information during trading.   He doesn't try to solve all issues by himself.  In addition, he will actively solicit other opinions before he attempts to answer operational problems. 

Chris has a very good sense of humor and is very easy to get along with.  Those traits are pivotal in a high-stress trading and scheduling environment.  His communication skills allow him to extract pertinent information from customers, competitors and operations personnel.  He's also very relentless in his pursuit of information.  Chris typically doesn't settle for a ""no"" answer or a response that doesn't make sense to him.  He is the consummate team player.  He backs up for Dominion and Iroquois and has scheduled all of TETCO market/production area at one time.  Chris was willing to schedule 3 pipes at once in a backup role.  He worked well with his partner and has built a good rapport with many of his industry contacts as well as his pipeline representatives.  In a very high stress environment, Chris has never lost his cool or been disrespectful.  
  	
Chris quickly learned all Enron internal systems as well as external pipeline systems and bulletin boards.   For someone so new to the game, he's got a good understanding of how gas moves on his pipes. He can determine the best mix of transport/supplies/markets to optimize flow and cost-effectiveness. He also familiarized himself with the VNG asset management deal and developed a method to capture storage and burn figures correctly.  Chris has the complete trust of his peers, his traders and his management team when making daily  decisions affecting his pipelines.  He shows a lot of interest in learning and improving his understanding of the industry and the  operations of his pipelines.  Chris has a very bright future in this group and in this company.  He is already working at the same level of performance as his peers that are at the senior specialist level.  In addition, I was also planning on putting him up for promotion at year-end 2001 before the bankruptcy occurred.  Due to all these reasons,  I recommend Christopher Ordway be promoted to Senior Specialist as soon as possible.

Please feel free to call me with questions or concerns.

Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has executed the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a more detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can deliver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will give you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Station 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving upstream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta 65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to clear up any issues with Trigen.

Frank

Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. Converting Policyholders into Customers: Insurance Agents Hold the Key
(Customer Relationship Management/Corporate Customer Management Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=825

Financial services institutions process sensitive customer data to deliver products and services to customers in a more efficient and effective manner. New technologies have made this data extremely mobile and vulnerable to uses beyond that for which it was initially collected. Regulators may issue stipulations about the data that can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance their demands for privacy with its need for adequate data. Technology can help, but one must understand its limitations. This report defines privacy management and describes how privacy management middleware works.

2. Integrated, Multichannel Service Systems
(Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=824

Financial service institutions today face a large, oftentimes bewildering, and rapidly evolving array of service constituencies and channels, each with its own service needs and expectations. Many vendors and some progressive institutions are moving to integrate these multichannel service systems to provide a single source of service information for use across different service channels. This early outlook report examines this still developing trend. It reviews the driving factors, identifies the principal service trends, presents a conceptual model for integrated service, explores success factors, and considers adoption patterns.

3. Risk Integration Services: Should We Order Out?
(Risk Management Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=827

Risk projects are complicated and high risk. Most financial services institutions do not have the staff to fulfill all of the required resources through all of a project's phases and will have to hire assistance from outside. There are new ways, however, to combine the resources of business and IT consultants, vendor-provided services, and in-house capacities to significantly reduce total project costs. Once an institution has a framework for evaluating the abilities and appropriateness of professional service providers and their risk services on offer, it can selectively purchase the expertise and experience it lacks. This report provides such a framework for decision-making, breaking the evaluation process down into phases that mirror the process of acquiring and implementing a financial risk management system.

"Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ","Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

PAVING STONE CORPORATION REPORTS 23% INCREASE IN 2001 FULL YEAR
REVENUES TO $31.5 MILLION

POMPANO BEACH, Fla., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Paving
Stone Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: PVNG), a market leader
in the interlocking concrete paver installation business
nationwide, today announced that its revenues for the 2001
fiscal year had increased by 23% to $31.5 million
compared with revenues of $25.5 million for the 2000 fiscal year.

For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2001, revenues were
$8.9 million compared with $7.3 million in the 2000 fourth
quarter, an increase of 22%. The increased revenues were
attributed to the continued growth of the Company's core offices
in Florida, Georgia and Arizona and the successful expansion into
California, Nevada, Texas and the Carolinas.

The Company said that it expects to release its 2001 fourth
quarter and full year financial results in late March 2002.

Maurice Sigouin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
Paving Stone Corporation, stated: ""Paving Stone Corporation
has established a leading nationwide position in the
interlocking paving stone installation industry. The increase
in our year-end and fourth quarter revenues reflect the ongoing
implementation of our strategy to expand our national footprint
while achieving operational efficiencies.""

The Company plans to continue to expand its position in the
marketplace through internal growth and the acquisition of
quality independent businesses in strategic markets. As a
premier paver installation and design company in the country,
Paving Stone Corporation believes it is poised to capture a
dominant market share in this expanding marketplace. According
to the Interlocking Concrete Pavement Institute, the industry's
trade association, while the annual installations of pavers
has quadrupled in the U.S. over the last 20 years, the U.S.
market of 300 million square feet of annual installation is
still a fraction of the annual installation rate in Europe.

Mr. Sigouin continued: ""We built this business on the
foundation of quality work and customer satisfaction.
Our company's growth is indicative of our thousands of
satisfied customers since 1990. Yet we realize there
are a vast number of potential customers that have yet
to learn about the cost advantages and convenience of
interlocking paving stones for commercial and residential
landscape and infrastructure applications.

""We are already expanding our national footprint and
bringing certain services in-house. By doing so, we have
the ability to generate up to three times the revenues on
a per square foot basis (as in a residential installation
in locations other than our Florida base). With this business
model, we expect to be able to substantially increase the
revenues per job, compared with jobs of similar size in our
Florida base. When one adds the components of geographic
expansion, increasing market share with large increases in
revenues on a per square foot basis, which result in higher
revenue per job, we have the potential for strong bottom line
growth.""

About Paving Stone Corporation

Paving Stone Corporation enjoys the position of market leader in the
interlocking concrete paver installation business nationwide and has
received numerous industry awards for design and installation
excellence.

Established a decade ago with two employees, the Company has grown
to include 80 employees and hundreds of installation crews located
in 16 offices nationwide. In addition to eight offices throughout
Florida, Paving Stone Corporation operates in Alabama, Arizona,
California, Georgia, Nevada, Tennessee, Texas, and the Carolinas.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its

Subject:	Sunday Weather Update 06/03

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"","On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.

Please assign them and the assistants a desk.

We are out of time on turning this churn in.  I must have it by noon.  I will be meeting with the move team tomorrow afternoon to set move dates.  I'm being asked about  the trading simulation for next week and since your churns aren't set I can't provide an answer.

Ina, please pull in whomever you need to work on the churn,  be sure and get with Superty's asst to help you with those people etc.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk beca! us! e of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S! un! day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabi! li! tate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy p! er! spective.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR! -! Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull! Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson!  , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is ! wo! rth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of de! ep! er leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wo! rt! h starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes ha! d ! only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers! , ! but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.

Thursday 1/31
Intermediate-term Outlook (weeks):
Seasonal Cycles: Positive.
Coppock Breadth Indicator: Sell/Neutral. Near a Buy.
Weekly MACD: Negative.
Conclusion: Longs are theoretically favored by the Seasonal Cycle, but the trend is down. Breadth measures have improved, but are mixed. We remain in a Bear Market. Shorts are favored with the caveat that declines during this part of the cycle are likely to be choppy. We are Intermediate-term BEARS.
Short/Intermediate-Term
ITBM: Positive. Unconfirmed.
Tuma Ammia: Neutral.
VIX Daily: Neutral. Nearing a Sell again!
CCI Daily: Neutral.
10-day ARMS: Neutral. Fast turn around. 
MACD Daily: Negative.
Senticator: Neutral.
Conclusion: Shorts are favored by the trend, but not the ITBM. The CCI allows for more upside. Any further bounce should probably be shorted, though. The VIX is rapidly approaching a Sell. Respect the trend.
Short-term
Tuma Ammia Turn Spotter: Nearing a Sell.
VIX 30': Positive. Nearing a Sell.
MACD 60': Positive.
Moving Averages: Negative. Watch the SPX 1120-1123 area.
Conclusion: Longs are favored but watch the VIX 30'. We are rapidly getting overbought. Expect a test of  the MA's.
*******************************
Last time, I said that I would look to short strength today, and I did. I didn't make any money, however. That said, the rally appears to be a bit much a bit too quickly. In fact, sentiment appears to have rapidly become overly optimistic. The VIX is close to a Sell, and while we don't have Rydex numbers, as yet, we are no longer near a buy and may be nearing a Sell. AAII sentiment shows a JUMP in bulls and a DROP in bears even as we declined.
In short, we have rallied very hard, very fast, without too much pessimism having been built up on the decline. It's almost as if everyone was just waiting for it so they could buy. Does anyone really think that the market very often makes it that easy to get into a Bull Market?
We have rallied above the 50-hour and that is bullish, as is the turn around in breadth. The ITBM has given a buy. That said, the first buy from the ITBM is rarely a good one. Today was the last day of the month, which usually is pretty strong (as is the first day), especially if the ""Big Boys"" want to make their client statements look good. The 50 day is just above, and we are incline to start shorting and make them stop us out. For those who are more nimble, however, wait for a turn down and then chase the market if you have to. No matter what, any artificial upward pressure will come off after tomorrow.
The way we see things is that not much has changed since the decline, except that optimism has been very quick to return to the market. We smell a rat. This may be the positive part of the Seasonal Cycle but we find it difficult to believe that rampant bullishness will be rewarded. Meanwhile, if we step back we'll see that the weekly MACD is on a Sell, as is the Daily MACD. The trend is down. All we are doing is testing the break down. The 21-day is just above. This will likely cause the market a bit of trouble.
Our favorite Gold Stocks are kicking booty. It may be time to take some profits, but if we do, we'll have to be looking to get right back in, after a short correction.
*****************
OPTION TRADING SUMMARY:
Trading action: None, but be alert for a Call Credit Spread idea, if we rally just a bit more.
Current Positions: None.
Past performance is not an indication of future returns. Options trading is not only risky, but also entails unique risks. Traders can lose a significant amount of money trading options, and should discuss this with their broker before taking any trades.

"FW: Logistics Commercial Realignment","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Choate, Heather  
Sent:	Monday, November 26, 2001 8:51 AM
To:	Neal, Scott; Shively, Hunter S.; Grigsby, Mike; Lagrasta, Fred; Martin, Thomas A.

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain.""   Emmitt Smith , RB D! AL! - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit.""   But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around.     Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.  Eddie Kennison , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to  statistical silence after a brief period of productivity.   Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run! , ! but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.  David Patten , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.  Troy Brown , WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.  Curtis Conway , WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.  Freddie Jones , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Jo! ne! s overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.  Larry Centers , RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.  Peerless Price , WR BUF - Free A! ge! nt Updated 10/28/01 Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01 ! The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.  James McKnight , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01 Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.  Amani Toomer , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01 Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matter w! ha! t the opposition is.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.  Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01 Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sund! ay! at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01 Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01 McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01 Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01 Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.   Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.  Clint Stoerner , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01 Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score ! in! Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.  Rob Johnson , QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01 Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

"Institutional Sentiment & Analysis 2/2/02","Results of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll taken after the close on 02/1

Response was to this question: ""At the end of next week will the S & P 500
close up (bull), down (bear), or unchanged/no opinion (neutral)?""

IT BULLS:	19%
IT BEARS:	71%

Our `Smart Money' Poll was twice as Bullish as Bearish and Neutral.

The Senticator is Neutral but almost Bearish.

Last week, we said that our guess was that we would see a bit of strength
to make the ""Smart Money"" guys feel good, but by the end of the week we'd
be heading south. We also reiterated our opinion that a Top of Intermediate
Proportions was in.

Not bad at all, if we do say so ourselves.

This week, we have to look for some lower prices, but with such a plurality
of Fearless Forecaster Bears, it's quite possible that we'll get a nice
reversal after a bit of weakness. The ""Smart Money"" appears to agree. The
Senticator, however, is throwing off neutral to bearish readings. We aren't
sure what to make of that. The best bet is to look for weakness early, and
if not then, then later in the week. Should we have a hard decline early in
the week, we would on the look-out for a sharp reversal. That is
technically the odds on play when there is a large plurality (better than
70%) of Bears. Note, however, that 71% is not as large a plurality as it
might be. We don't have a lot of data with readings like that, so our
confidence is not as high as it would be with a reading of 85%-90% Bears.

Mark Young

See www.Traders-Talk.com in the Market Analysis area for a historical chart

FF sentiment.

ABOUT SENTIMENT AND ANALYSIS

The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll is taken each Friday from a
generally static pool of experienced technical analysts (both private and
professional). The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment is not normally a good
fade, though there are times when it can be.

The Fearless Forecaster sentiment data is useful on the short term; the
Fearless Forecasters tend to be right. Typically they are right sooner
rather than later, if there's a large plurality. On the flip side of the
equation, if 90% or more are Bullish or Bearish, the odds of them being
right over the very short term are huge, but the odds of a major turn (in
the opposite direction) soon thereafter are also quite good.

We have also found that when the Fearless Forecasters are evenly split,
look for a BIG move in either direction, but usually down.

Over the years, we have found a number of other tools to help in evaluating
the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment. We publish this in our weekly
""Institutional Sentiment & Analysis"" (a part of our institutional
research). These additional tools are our ""Smart Money"" poll, and our
Senticator. Both are proprietary polls run by us.

We have found that the Senticator tends to be right by the end of the week
(as much as 87% of the time), though it tends to be more accurate in a
rising market than a falling one.

The ""Smart Money"" pollees are very useful when there is divergent opinion.
It's generally NOT a good idea to fade the ""Smart Money"" unless
""'EVERYONE'"" (all sentiment measures) is in agreement. When in doubt about
the meaning of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll, defer to the ""Smart
Money"" poll. The ""Smart Money"" guys are folks with whom I've worked or whom
I've watched for YEARS. They all have different approaches and they're all
VERY good (not infallible, just good analysts/traders).

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

To customize, reschedule, or turn off these reports please  click here    NFL Reports, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at all this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01  Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.

"Can you help me?","I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox at the end of every week. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Fantasy Football Matchups   ? Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Fantasy Football Matchups     Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a  premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to  help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our  Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar)  Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.  	


    Customize Reports to Display the Info You Want     Did you know you can customize the settings of most reports  on the site, and save those settings so they are displayed  each time you visit the report? For example, suppose you'd  like the Transactions, View report to display only Add/Drops  over the past 7 days for all teams. Enter those settings,  click GO and then click the Save icon displayed over the  report. Now each time you click Transactions, View on the toolbar, the report is displayed according to your custom  settings. After you click Save you can click the E-Rept icon to have your new custom report e-mailed to you on the days you choose.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA     Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins?    Answer - GG     As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied.  	


  Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL     I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend?    Answer - GG     Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game.  	


  Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE     Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks?  Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available.    Answer - GG     Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player.  	


    Tip of the Week      Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

I know you  guys may be  still in the hiring mode.  I've attached 2
resumes
that are worth a look.

Beth Jenkins is a senior commercial person with extensive derivatives
knowledge and industry experience.  She has
a trading background but has interest in pursuing Origination
opportunities also.
 <<Beth resume.doc>>


Vickie Versen worked for me most recently trading physical gas in
the Gulf and previous scheduled on several East pipes.  I think she
has interest in considering either trading or scheduling.

Bubba, 
 
Don't talk to Patro that way.  He is a friend  of mine.  That girl he was speaking to at the Astros game was his  daughter.  He can't help that she is taller than him.  That doesn't  make him any less a man......or does it?
 
My update......I'm living in New Jersey,  married 9 years with two boys, six and three.  I work in  Manhattan for NIKE.  I'm the East Coast Baseball Field Rep. dealing with  agents and athletes.  I guess you could say that I give away free stuff to  millionaires while I am looking for the next Jeter/Griffey/A-Rod/etc.  I  actually get paid to go to Yankee and Shea Stadiums and interact with the  athletes, watch baseball games. and read the sports section.  Someone  has to do it.
 
I know what you are thinking and the answer is  no.  I won't get you free shoes.
 
Hope every is well.  Glad to see the Phi Delt  love being passed along.  The best place to send me a message is at work at  mike.cavers@nike.com  or home at  cooperscloset@msn.com .

"Reliant Unveils Natural Gas Index, Risk Management Tools","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Nov 20, 1:53 PM
Reliant Unveils Natural Gas Index, Risk Management Tools 
Reliant Energy Wholesale Group unveiled a new natural gas index and associated financial risk management instrument, designed to enable natural gas traders to better hedge risk for their companies and portfolio clients during the heating season. The Weather-Sensitive Gas Load Index (WGLI) measures current and forecasted residential and commercial natural gas consumption. To work with the index, Reliant has developed a financial instrument tailored for gas traders, called the WGLI Swap. 
WGLI is based on the weighted sum of heating-degree-days in four areas: Chicago, the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, Philadelphia and Sacramento. A heating-degree-day is recorded when the average temperature falls below 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is assumed that customers of natural gas companies then begin using their residential furnaces and commercial heating systems. 
""The index captures more than 90% of the variation in residential and commercial gas load,"" said Pat Strange, senior vice president of Reliant's Gas Trading. ""Using this index, weather forecasts can be translated immediately into residential and commercial consumption forecasts. Inputs to the index formula are publicly available, and the index is relatively simple to calculate. Calculations can be made as needed on a weekly, monthly or seasonal basis."" 
Regional gas load indices are also available for the Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regions. 
WGLI is set to equal 100 for a typical week in the heating season (a typical week represents the weekly average for the last 10 heating seasons). For example, a WGLI value of 110 indicates residential and commercial gas usage is 10% higher than a typical week; conversely, a WGLI of 90 indicates that residential and commercial gas consumption is 10% lower. 
Based on WGLI, Reliant designed a standardized financial derivative, the weekly WGLI Swap. The contract is designed to mirror weekly changes in residential and commercial gas load. Beginning with the upcoming heating season, Reliant and other corporations said they are committed to making markets in WGLI and Mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes regional gas load indices weekly Swaps. The WGLI swaps may be used to enhance the risk/reward profile of a trader's gas portfolio, and traders can use it to hedge volume risks embedded in their trading positions. 
For details of WGLI and the terms of a WGLI weekly swaps contract, contact Jeff Wang, Reliant's product development manager for weather risk management, at (713) 207-1184 or at jwang@reliant.com <mailto:jwang@reliant.com>.

"Southwestern Student Conducts Survey","PLEASE E-MAIL RESPONSES TO: davise@southwestern.edu

Dear Southwestern Alumni,

My name is Brooke Davis, and I am taking an Organizational Communication class
at Southwestern University.  A large portion of the class is dedicated to an
intensive class group project centered on the University.  We will study
Southwestern as an organization and apply our research to relevant
Organizational Communication theories.  My class would like to enlist your
help
by asking you to complete the following survey:


How did you first hear about Southwestern?

What were your first impressions of the school?

How did those impressions/views change during the time you spent at
Southwestern?

Have your views about the school changed since you graduated?

Does Southwestern's rank in magazines and books affect how you see
Southwestern?  If so, how, and if not, why?

Are you actively involved with the school, and if so, how?

What do you like about Southwestern, and what would you like to improve?

Do you feel you have any control over what our campus looks like?  Why do you
feel this way?

Which building is the most important building on campus?  Why do you feel this
way?

The campus is continuously filled with more buildings made of
limestone.  Why do
you think the University chooses this type of building material for most all
buildings?

What type of image do you feel is tied into the way this campus has been
designed to look?

Describe the way the Southwestern campus looks in one word:

On a scale of 1-10 (10 being the highest), how important to the University is
aesthetic appearance?

What do you believe is the most important way alumni can be involved with the
University?

How do you feel Southwestern as an organization has changed since you
graduated?
Do you believe these changes are positive or negative and why?

How does the University keep you informed about campus events and
occurrences?
Do you feel the information you receive is sufficient?

How often do you visit the SU Web site?

Do you access the ""Alumni Home Page"" or the ""General Home Page""?

In general, what do you think of the Web site?

Specifically, what images or ideas do you think SU is trying to send to alumni
through the Web site?

What role do you feel you play at Southwestern?

What year did you graduate?

Additional Comments:



Please return responses to me via email at davise@southwestern.edu.  My class
and I greatly appreciate your help.

Sincerely,
Brooke Davis '03

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

On Scott's last paycheck-Dec.31.  there was a deduction labeled ""other deductions"" for 1537.  Is there anyway we can determine what exactly that was for?  Thanks much.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"RE: ENA v. Triad","        Andy/Richard,

        Please be advised that I just got the postcard notice back from the court regarding the filing of our notice of non-suit in this matter.  I will get a certified copy.

        By copy of this, I am asking Becky Zikes to do two things:

        1.  Call the Court and make absolutely sure that the hearing on our motion for default judgment scheduled for January 25 is cancelled, and if necessary, send a follow-up letter.
	
         2.  If we haven't already done so, send the appropriate letter to the AAA advising them that we are withdrawing our claim on a without-prejudice basis.

       This will likely be my last communication on this file.  It has a been a pleasure representing you in this matter.

        Britt

      Andy,

      This is primarily for the benefit of the others on this e-mail.  Per your authority, and in order to avoid further costs, I will be filing a notice of non-suit in this matter, probably by the end of this week.  This will effectively dismiss this case without prejudice to refiling.  I will be doing the same thing in the dormant AAA arbitration.  Accordingly, the presently-scheduled hearing on our motion for default, scheduled for January 25, will be cancelled, and we won't need to bother Bryce with that.  I will then be closing my file on this matter.

     I will keep you advised.

      Britt

Subject:	FW: ENA v. Triad

        Andy,

        Subject to your and everyone else's thoughts, I recommend that we non-suit this collection matter.
	
       Triad was a small WMBE distributor of oil and gas based in Columbus, Maryland.  When the matter was referred to the Unit for filing suit, Triad had defaulted on the payment of $1,800,000 in spot gas sales.  When we investigated, we learned that Triad's corporate charter had been yanked because of the failure to pay state corporate franchise taxes prior to the time it began making sales to us.  Triad appeared to be operating out of the house of its principal, Sherwood Purnell.

       Tanya, Bill and I discussed at the time of referral that Triad may not even have a sharpened pencil to satisfy a judgment.  As I recall, the thinking was that ENA wanted to set an example that counter-parties couldn't simply walk away from contracts without being pursued.  Also, I think mention was made that a 10% chance of collecting on this judgment made it worthwhile.  Obviously, a lot has changed since then.

       We originally filed an arbitration demand under the AAA rules, pursuant to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the spot gas sales contracts.  After several telefax services, it became clear that Triad wouldn't answer.  On the other hand, Purnell would call me up and offer to settle with ENA by continuing to do business with ENA on some really awesome deals (this is tongue-in-cheek).

      After consulting with Richard, I told the AAA that the arbitration should be put on the back burner while we filed an action for default judgment in Texas court.  We have done this.  We still need to (a) finalize a motion for default judgment (b) prepare and present Bryce and me as witnesses at a hearing and (b) then go to Columbus to get our default judgment domesticated and see if there are any assets to collect on .  That will likely require retaining outside counsel in Maryland.  

       I think it extraordinarily unlikely that we will find any non-exempt assets to collect on.

       I await your instructions.

       Britt

	Bryce,

	The hearing on the motion for default judgment by ENA against Triad, which had been set for tomorrow, Friday, December 14, at 10:00 a.m., has been reset for Friday, January 25, at 10:00 a.m.  Is your schedule clear to attend?

	Many thanks.

	 Britt

	P.S. to Tarsha and Becky:  please put this on your calendars.  Corinne, the clerk, is getting concerned about the number of times we have rescheduled this, even though I told her it was because we kept having to wait on Soldiers and Sailors' affidavits.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretc! h.!   Trent Dilfer , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.  Matt Hasselbeck , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from! a! Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.  Lamar Smith , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Upd! at! ed 10/23/01 Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.  Terrence Wilkins , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him! . ! He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.   Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota.   Duce Staley , RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries lat! e ! in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement.   Joe Nedney , K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week.   Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.  Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori ! Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was abl! e ! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

First, I want to thank you so much for all of the opportunities that you have afforded me here on the East desk this past year as well as for your wisdom and direction.  Regretfully, my last day of employment here at ENRON will be Tuesday, February 5, 2002.  

I hope that UBS will be especially gracious to you and that you will do great things with the new company.  And again, thank you so much for everything.

Subject: Westchester Peewee Baseball Warm-up


Dear PeeWee Baseball '02 Player:

It's hard to believe that the 2002 SBMSA Baseball season is just around
the corner, but it is!  This year's Skills Evaluations for Westchester
PeeWees (3rd and 4th grades) will be held at the Spring Forest fields on
Saturday and Sunday, February 2nd and 3rd.  More information on this
will be telephoned to each player early next week that will detail the
exact time to show-up.  For those of us, however, that are in need of a
little ""warm-up"" before the evaluations, informal batting practice
(machine) and fielding drills will be going on next Wednesday and
Thursday (Jan 30 and 31st) at the Spring Forest fields from 6 - 8 pm.
To participate, come by either day (or both) with your glove, bat and
batting helmet.

See you next week,

David Benninger
Westchester PeeWee Commissioner

Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Kevin Dyson! , WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice. Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01 George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01 McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game.   Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence.   Damon Jones , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01 Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23.     Dennis Northcutt , WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week.   Todd Heap , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle.   Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01 Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play.     Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01 According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week.     J.J. Stokes , WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01 Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable.   Ike Hilliard , WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01 Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed.   Ron Dixon , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01!  Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01 According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.    Anthony Wright , QB DAL - Free Agent! Updated 10/23/01 Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable.   Dez White , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues.   David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 ! Te! rrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver.   Tony Martin , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01 According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season g! am! e this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go.   Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01 Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.  Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.  Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01 Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week ! Se! ven.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01 Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/22/01 Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy t! ol! d the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while.

  The recent anthrax scares have led to a handful of companies being
discovered that have products
  available that test and disinfect antimicrobial agents. Vital Living
Products (OTC BB: VLPI) recently
  announced it had developed home testing kits for Anthrax and the stock
soared to a 52-week high on
  Monday with shares climbing from $0.06 to $2.00. Another company,
Veridien (OTC BB: VRDE)
  announced that its sanitizing and disinfecting products are designed
to stop or slow and control
  environmental challenges and the stock jumped from $0.05 to $0.13.
Other companies like
  eSAFETYWORLD, Cepheid, Vital Living, and Ozolutions, and InVision
Technologies have emerged and
  shareholders have been rewarded in this era of fears for personal
safety. Some are calling it the ""Anthrax
  Bubble.""

  *** TRSG ANNOUNCES NEW PRODUCT LINE ***

  LAS VEGAS--Oct. 25, 2001--TRSG Corp. (OTC BB: TSGO), a majority-owned
subsidiary of
  Gateway Distributors Ltd., Thursday announced it has entered into a
preliminary agreement to acquire
  certain assets of Mobility Solutions Inc.  These assets include the
Rest Assured Product Line of hand-held,
  low-cost devices used to detect the presence of biological agents such
as Bacillus Anthraci (commonly
  referred to as Anthrax) as well as many other biological agents.

  The Rest Assured Biological Agent Detection Product line utilizes UV-A
waves or waves in the 320 to
  380 nm range, commonly referred to as black light or wood's light,
that have been determined to not cause
  sunburn to human skin though the use of eye protection is recommended
during use. These products are
  for detection purposes only and are not intended as a treatment or
cure for any specific disease.

  Ongoing research is being conducted at this time to verify the
product's effectiveness in the use of

Becillus Anthraci, which is currently
  making headlines throughout the world. Independent research
laboratories are conducting this research.

Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.  Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scori! ng! threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.  Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/21/01 Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him.   Trent Green , QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week.   Doug Chapman  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.  David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01 Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   ! Mi! chael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster.   Jeff Graham , WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot.   LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01 ! Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league.   Desmond Clark , TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis.   Brian Griese , QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Griese (shoulder) started Sunda! y'! s game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss.   Peter Warrick , WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often.   Corey Dillon , RB CIN - Frank Updated 10/21/01 The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.  ! David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.  Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01 Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. ! De! spite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01 McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.!  Eddie George , RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01 George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year.   Shawn Jefferson , WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.  Alge Crumpler , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.  Albert Connell , WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.  Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capa! bl! e of providing owners with regularly good numbers.  Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01 Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01 Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.  Anthony Becht , TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players.   Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.  Jerome Bettis , RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.  Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01 Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01 Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, pos! ti! ng six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. Get Smart: Intelligent Order Routing and the Institutional Investor
(Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=734
(Wholesale eFinancial Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=735

Institutional investors, like their individual counterparts, want to get the best possible execution of their order. While some institutional investors have been improving their order management strategies and technology throughout the 1990s, the buy side as a whole is only now realizing that it needs to pay closer attention to how orders are treated to determine the true operating costs of a mutual or pension fund. New technologies are emerging that are helping them educate themselves and trade smarter. One such technology, intelligent order routing, is a direct response to the emergence of more-and more fragmented-marketplaces. Initially embraced by day traders trading via direct access brokers, this technology is now making its way up the food chain. This report looks at various definitions of intelligence in order routing, focusing in particular on institutional investors. At the end of the day, it is not so much about establishing a standard definition of best execution as it is about making sure that the investing firm (or individual) feels that it has sufficient control of the order.


2. Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA
(Customer Interaction Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=736
Many financial institutions are devoting considerable attention to figure out how to serve the wealth management needs of individuals. We have noted a growing, almost feverish pitch among a rapidly expanding number of application and platform vendors that claim wealth management and/or investment management as a solution focus. This brief examines the state of the retail investor marketplace in the United States, which represents the most logical view of the investment management opportunity. We conclude with our perspective of life cycle opportunities and technology solution capabilities that financial institutions should consider to remain effective competitors. A related Customer Knowledge research brief, ""Analytical CRM: Understanding Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models"" (Vol. 4, Brief 7, June 7, 2001), examines relevant analytical challenges and opportunities.


3. Analytical CRM: Customer Needs, LTV, and Retail Broker/Dealer Business Models
(Customer Knowledge Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=737

Retail broker/dealers in the United States face a dilemma: as they strive to excel in the delivery of topnotch investment services, they must find enough retail investors of the right types. Our companion Customer Interaction research brief ""Connecting with Customers: CRM Touches Retail Broker/Dealers in the USA"" (Vol. 4, Brief 8, June 7, 2001) defines the retail investor marketplace and the role of customer interaction technology solutions. In this brief, we examine business models and relevant analytical challenges and opportunities.


4. Wireless Payments at the Point of Sales: Expanding POSsibilities
(e-Payments Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=738
Financial institutions face a choice: they can participate in developing new wireless payment technologies, or they can sit on the sidelines as others take the lead. If they don't get involved, they risk disintermediation by entities like telcos that are not hesitating to jump into the driver's seat with wireless. This report examines the present state of wireless technology and the competing standards that are available today. It also looks at mobile telecommunications firms and their motivations to promote wireless payments. The report contains three case studies of wireless payments programs: one a joint bank/telco initiative, one a bank initiative, and one a company initiative.

Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, how! ev! er, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet.   Patrick Jeffers , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad i! f ! at all possible.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01 Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense.   Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective.    Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time.   Troy Hambrick , RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point.   Michael Bennett , RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/17/01 Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.  Shane Matthews , QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the line! up! Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01 Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous.   Keenan McCardell , WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Sean Dawkins , WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 10/17/01 Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score.     Kyle Brady , TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. H! e ! won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season.   Jimmy Smith , WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01 Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.  Herman Moore , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01 According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.  Charlie Garner , RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01 The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.  Travis Henry  , RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/17/01 Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.  Jay Riemersma , TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01 It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.  Dedric Ward , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01 According to the Dallas Morning Star, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster.   Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01 Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play.  Greg Clark , TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01 Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Contra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.    More Updates  Player! N! ews Teams  [IMAGE]  Neal/McKay Player News  Keenan McCardell , Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01 McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.   Lamar Smith , Active RB Updated 10/16/01 Smith was in a walking boot after suffering a sprained ankle during Sunday's game against the Jets, according to the Miami Herald. He should be fine for Week Seven when the Dolphins return from the bye week.  Tony Richardson , Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01 Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermeil said Monday there is a chance Richardson could play Sunday in Arizona, according to the Kansas City Star. Richardson is battling a shoulder injury.  Tiki Barber , Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01 Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks.   Vinny Testaverde , Reserve QB Updated 10/14/01 Testaverde had a good outing against Miami, throwing for 168 yards and two touchdowns. He's still not worth starting ever week, but Testaverde is very useful Fantasy-wise when the matchup is right.   Ron Dayne , Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01 Dayne started on Sunday against St. Louis despite a neck injury. He rushed for 88 yards and a score in New York's 15-14 loss, and may be solidifying his grasp on the featured back role for the G-Men.   Peyton Manning , Active QB Updated 10/12/01 Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.  Jerry Rice , Active WR Updated 10/12/01 Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.  Freddie Jones , Active TE Updated 10/12/01 Jones has been a disappointment so far this year. Don't count on good numbers from him this week, because the Chargers will feature the run against New England.  Mike Anderson , Active RB Updated 10/12/01 Expect excellent numbers from Anderson this week. He always plays well against Seattle, and the Seahawks still lack the talent to stop him from gaining big chunks of yardage as the game wears on.  Az-Zahir Hakim , Active WR Updated 09/08/01 Hakim might see a few passes thrown his way during the Rams' season opener Sunday in Philadelphia. However, his offensive potential is limited as a No. 3 receiving threat, so his Fantasy ceiling isn't very high.  Shawn Bryson , Reserve RB Updated 08/23/01 Bryson suffered a sprained ankle during practice on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays later in the day, but the team has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this point. Bryson, who will be a game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cincinnati, is worth a later-round flier at best on Draft Day.   Broncos , Active DT Updated 08/23/01 Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses taken on Draft Day.   Matt Stover , Active K Updated 12/08/00 Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

  Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI     I am stuck on my last starter.  Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty  Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he  is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should  be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the  season.    Answer - GG     Alexander has been a revelation in his first two  starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to  him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not  be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and   Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who  may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker  will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not  destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a  great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score  a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a  Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems.  	


  Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA     Should I start Rod Gardner or  Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is  looking better each week.    Answer - GG     Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains  instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be  geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The  Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of  the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is  quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants'  No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing  Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week.  Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with  Hilliard because of his experience and continuing  improvement.  	


  Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO     I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB -  Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson?    Answer - GG     Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but  the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in  him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas  after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a  respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a  Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against  the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with  the hotter player, and that would be Thomas.  	


    Tip of the Week      Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is  a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions  override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in  the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the  Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle.  And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be  surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

	I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this 
	concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their decision any day now 
	and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our 
	dependence on the minimum load factor.  

	I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
	I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum.  
	I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today.  

	I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving ASAP.  

	Thanks,
	mk

Deskheads:

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Thank you,

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Smith & Wesson (SAFH) Super-Light Hand Gun","
Stockupticks.com 	[IMAGE]	


	[IMAGE]	
 Welcome to Stockupticks.com Newsletter 	Issue #13 - October 26, 2001 	
	[IMAGE]	

  
  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   e-Blast     [IMAGE] *** Important News *** [IMAGE]  MA Union News Reports New Smith & Wesson Super-Light Guns   Could Be Carried By Flight Crews On Commercial Airliners  In the Spring of this year, Stockupticks brought you the story of a small-cap company that produced firearm safety and security products. That company,  Saf-T-Hammer (OTC BB: SAFH) later acquired legendary gun manufacturer Smith & Wesson. One of the products in development at that time was a gun made from a new, lightweight, exotic-metal alloy making the gun easier to carry and conceal. Due to interest in using this weapon for arming flight crews on commercial airliners, the dealer response has been tremendous.    [IMAGE]  (see article below)       [IMAGE]  Business News   Lightweight revolvers hot item for S&W   Wednesday, October 24, 2001  By WILLIAM FREEBAIRN    A new line of ultra-light revolvers in stores this month is proving a success for Smith & Wesson, which can't keep up with demand. The new guns are among the first in the world to use scandium, a metal that has been used in Russian fighter jets and baseball bats. They are being marketed under the AirLite Sc label and all are capable of firing a powerful .357-caliber Magnum round that had been previously unavailable in such a lightweight gun.    The smaller revolvers, which weight just over 11 ounces, have been shipping for several weeks; larger guns should reach dealers in the coming days.   ""It's a hot item,"" said Herb A. Belin, handgun product manager for Smith & Wesson. ""Our constraint is our production rate."" The guns are more expensive than stainless-steel revolvers. New guns carry a suggested price of between $700 and $800 each.    The lighter guns are likely to be purchased by people who want them for personal defense, especially those with permits to carry concealed weapons, Belin said. Officials said developing the guns using the new metal took longer than expected and taught them some lessons in metallurgy. In high-speed video footage of the gun firing, the frame and barrel moved dramatically due to the scandium alloy's flexibility. ""That gun does the rumba,"" Belin said.    Designers increased the size of some parts of the gun to reduce flexing. Titanium was used in the cylinder for strength, but testing showed it was also needed in the center pin and other parts of the weapon. Steel is used for the hammer and trigger. ""This taught us to make even stronger, tougher guns,"" Belin said.    Scandium is a little-known metal that occupies a place on the periodic table immediately before titanium. Discovered in the late 1800s, it found use in the former Soviet Union, which had a virtual monopoly on the supply from the Ukraine. The Soviets used it in fighter jets and missile parts. When the Soviet Union broke up, the metal began to see more widespread use, for example in aluminum baseball bats and mountain bike frames.    Although scandium costs about $7,000 a pound, the amount needed to mix with aluminum and other alloying agents is small. Adding a little scandium to aluminum strengthens the material more than twofold, Belin said.    Its weight will increase the number of people willing to carry it, Belin said. ""You don't need a holster. You can carry it in your pocket.""    The lightest of the scandium guns is less than half of the weight of the lightest .357-caliber Magnum the company made before. Because of their light weight and flexible scandium-aluminum alloy frame, the guns deliver a rapid ""kick"" to the hands of the person firing them. ""Recoil is an issue,"" Belin said.    The gun can fire less-powerful rounds than the .357 magnum, for example the .38 special, that can reduce recoil. ""You really have to work at not flinching (when firing,)"" Belin said.    Smith & Wesson officials believe there may be another market for the super-light guns. They have developed a prototype scandium alloy gun that could be carried by flight crews on commercial airliners. There have been calls for flight crews to be armed, although no steps have been taken by the government in that direction.    The Smith & Wesson prototypes are black with an internal hammer, so they could be carried in a trouser or jacket pocket without catching on the fabric. The guns could be modified to fire a lower-velocity round, which is less likely to cause damage to an aircraft, officials said.    The prototype air crew guns have not been publicly revealed before, Belin said. A spokesman said the prototypes are simply a design concept and will not necessarily be produced or be shared with people outside the company.    ? 2001 UNION-NEWS.

ok i think i understand

1)  Kam we need to book the MGAM and TEAC for the correct term.  Any losses would hit the desk as this represents deal entry error and the CES book (for taking hits) doesn't exist anymore --  How big is the $ value of the MTM?

2)  Scott Goodell, you need to call Calderone to resolve MGAG

Scott,

We have booked the remaining volumes in a ""dummy book"" to see the value for Tennessee Energy Acquisition and MGAM.  They are income to the east and central desks, creating additional index positions.  How would you like to handle this with the firm traders?  They will need to sign off on this.

Mark, any objections of us booking the additional months since we now have the contracts?

"Pre-Flight Fund Trader 2/1/02","Pre Flight Fund Trader for 2/1/02
Thursday 1/31/02
*********************************
Real Money Seasonal Trading Account (New! All weightings are approximate)
80% Money Market
5% HGMCY (Harmony Gold).
15% Rydex Tempest Fund.
Buy another 15% position in Rydex Tempest Fund, IF the SPX is not down >7 points at cut off. We will buy early as we were unable to purchase the additional position today..
We are a little bit short and we hate dealing with the bounce, but the trend had broken and the market could easily have fallen out of bed. We'll add this position if the market rallies. We won't be pigs, however. Harmony Gold, as we thought, has shrugged off any weakness and is flying more. It may be time to take a profit.
Our managed tracking account is up 16.98% for the 18 months since June 30, 2000. This is a very conservative approach (~1/3 the risk of the market), using both long and short funds as well as the occasional favored sector/stock idea. All performance is net of fees, commissions, and interest. Your results may vary, and standard disclaimers may apply. We DO use discretion. For further information, call us now. 
Active Model
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 10/2.
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 10/3.
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 11/15.
The market is driving us nuts, but the trend has turned. We have committed, perhaps foolishly, to holding this one. Cover all positions if we print 1065.
Hedged Model
50% Waterhouse Dow Fund (WDOWX)
25% Profunds Ultra Bear
Watch out for a memo. We may increase our Ultra Bear exposure.
The MACD is negative, and the Weekly MACD is negative. The Seasonal Cycle is positive, but now less so. We are Bears.
VIX Trader
Flat.
Sold 1/2 position in Profunds Ultra Bull from 1/16 a/o 1/31.
**********************************
Last time, I said that I expected things to be very volatile and that the shortest trends were all up. We had to think that there might be a bit more buying, but I was convinced that the speed of the sentiment recovery boded ill for the market's future. My call was for the lows to be taken out by next week. 
The market has a bit more punch that I'd thought, and while I'm less than sanguine (alright, I'm nervous) about that call, it really isn't all that unreasonable.
The sentiment measures I look at show a very quick acceptance of the rally. Worse, the AAII (American Association of Individual Investors) sentiment poll shows a JUMP in bulls and a DROP in bears even as we declined this week. Do these people think that they've found the ""key to the lock"", and that the only trick to making money is to buy dips?
The way I see it, we have rallied very hard, very fast, without too much pessimism having been built up on the decline. It's almost as if everyone was just waiting for it so they could buy. In my experience, the market rarely makes it easy to buy when you should be buying. If the ""Average Joe"" is finding it easy to be bullish on this last decline, then I have to think that he's going to get a rude awakening.
I don't want to get too ""beared up"" however. The market has rallied above the 50-hour moving average and that is bullish, as is the dramatic improvement in breadth. In fact, our favorite breadth indicator, the ITBM (see our terms page link, below) has given a buy. That said, I've found that the first buy from the ITBM is rarely a good one. We also need to remember that yesterday was the last day of the month, which is usually pretty strong, especially if the big institutions want to make their client statements look good. The 50-day moving average is just above us, and I am incline to start shorting there. For those who are more nimble, however, it makes sense wait for a turn down and then chase the market if you have to. No matter what, any artificial upward pressure will come off after today, if the buying isn't already spent.
The way I see things is that not much has changed since the decline, except that optimism has been very quick to return to the market. I smell a rat. This may be the positive part of the Seasonal Cycle but I find it difficult to believe that rampant bullishness will be rewarded. If we step back and look at the market we'll see that the weekly trend is negative, as is the Daily trend. Simply enough, the trend is down. All the market is doing is testing the break down. 
I still expect the recent lows to be taken out. Thereafter, I'll allow for perhaps a very steep rally into tax time or thereabouts.
***************************************
Technical Review:
Coppock Breadth Indicator:  Sell. The CBI was up 0.3 to 190.7, 0.2 above the exponential. 
ITBM: Buy. Unconfirmed and suspect.
Seasonal: Positive
VIX: Nearing a Sell.
MACD: Negative.
Weekly MACD: Sell.
If you have questions, call us.

"FROM RAYMOND BOWEN, JR., EVP, FINANCE & TREASURER","To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

                      COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION                                 
                        NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                                OCTOBER 18, 2001

Notice ID: 3193
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          


NOTE:  The following is being provided by Columbia as notice to all of its 
shippers of potential outages or reductions in available capacity in the 
identified portions of the system due to construction activities, routine 
maintenance, modifications, tests or repairs undertaken to protect the 
integrity and performance capability of its storage and transmission 
facilities.  The information provided below is subject to change for numerous 
reasons, including but not limited to, third-party controlled events and 
decisions, weather, work schedules, equipment availability, force majeure 
events, etc.  Thus, while Columbia is willing to provide this notice and update 
it periodically as necessary, Columbia is unable to represent and warrant that 
the specific activities will occur, or that they will occur on or near the 
specified dates. 

SUBJECT:   LINE SM-123

Columbia anticipates that between October 25th and October 27th, Line SM-123 
will be taken out of service due to long-wall mining activity.  Columbia 
estimates the line to be out of service for twenty-one (21) days.  The start 
date and duration of the outage is contingent upon the actual timing and 
progress of the long-wall mining activity.  Given the level of firm commitments 
in this area, Columbia believes that there will be no available capacity for 
interruptible transportation.

The following receipt points will be affected:

   Equitable Gas:    Beaver Creek      (H1)
                     Hi Hat            (F3)

   CNR Pipeline:     Boldman           (CNR02)
                     Conoway           (CNR03)
                     Johns Creek       (CNR08)
                     Canada            (CNR09)
                     Canada            (CNR10)
                     Stafford          (CNR11)
                     Thacker/Majestic  (CNR12)
                     Briar Mtn.        (CNR13)
                     Huff Creek        (CNR14)

   Conoco:           Grant             (P1)

The same is true with respect to any Appalachian production flowing directly 
into Columbia's Line KA between Columbia's Boldman Compressor Station and 
Columbia's Huff Creek Compressor Station as well as production flowing into 
Columbia's Lines SM-116, KA-15, PM-3 and PM-17.

Subject:	Request for Migration of Sitara EOLBridge into Production

Hello Zhiyong,
	I have implemented an enhancement to avoid the problem of restarting the Sitara EOLBridge when there are missing startdate and enddate.  This fix will take care of this morning's problem.

EOL will be sent a Failed status similar to the following:
	message={EolTransactionId=2101638 TransactionSysDealId="""" BridgeEntityName=""EOLBridge"" Message=""Missing StartDate or EndDate"" Status=""F"" BridgeDate=""20011025170945CDT""}

I throughly tested the change by sending over 400 sample deals from this morning.  Due to the ""Bid Week"" window, please approve this  bridge enhancement for tonight's migration.  Thank you.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

"In Memoriam","In Memoriam

I'd like to take a moment to remember my first manager as a broker, Bill
Alexander of Legg Mason. Bill died last Sunday from complications related
to diabetes. Bill was a classic stock jocky, of the old school. In fact he
began in the business when the business was old school...a Gentlemen's
Club... back in the days before discount brokers. He knew how to read a
chart, buy momentum, and how to cut a loss short. He taught me a lot about
liquidity, and money flow, and technical analysis. He also taught me to
read the tape and trade off it. There weren't many like Bill. There weren't
many who were good enough to survive the new competitive environment. Bill
was. Not only did he survive, but he thrived.

Part of an era died on Sunday with Bill. He will be missed by me and by
hundreds of clients and friends.

Good bye, Bill.

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

	[IMAGE]	

  
  [IMAGE] [IMAGE] [IMAGE]   e-Blast   [IMAGE]     Editor's Note [IMAGE]  Here at StockUpTicks we try to be very selective regarding the companies that we expose to our membership. Since we're not a ""pump"", ""tout"", or  ""hype"" service and don't render opinion about our featured companies, we'll never pressure you to buy or sell these stocks.  However, we are very proud of the performance of our featured companies.  Before you read about BioSecure, today's featured company, take a look at how each of the companies we've featured over the last couple of months have performed.    All percentages below are based on today's close (Nov. 16, 2001) Featured Company Profile Date Price Day Before Profile Today's Closing Price % Increase SAFH October 26, 2001  .76 .86 + 13% GPRX November 4, 2001  .92 1.15 + 25% GTXE November 12, 2001  .84 1.55 + 84% OZLU September 4, 2001  1.07 1.81 + 69%  ***That's an average increase of 47%***  Remember, these aren't necessarily the highest prices since our mailings.  Rather, these are the actual percentages based on today's prices compared to the trading day BEFORE we published.    In some cases the stocks have actually traded much higher.  Today's Featured Company is BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI)   (Presently Known As Yes Clothing Co.  Inc)    As company's inevitably succeed or fail in the publicly traded arena, their listings are often acquired by new companies in what is known as a reverse merger. In this instance, BioSecure has acquired the ""shell"" of Yes Clothing Co. for its own purposes.  Obviously, Yes Clothing Co. is no longer an active part of this publicly traded vehicle and the stock symbol (YCCI) is now reflective of the business plan of BioSecure Corporation.      [IMAGE]  Personal Protection Products [IMAGE]    Effective personal protection is essential to any person who may be exposed to potentially hazardous substances. Since the Sepember 11th attacks changed our lives forever, many believe that situations may arise when people at home or work may be exposed to bio-hazards. BioSecure will develop, license, purchase, and market bio-technical products to consumers and businesses to assist in preventing or minimalizing any exposure to harmful biological or chemical agents.   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] Breaking News from BioSecure (OTCBB: YCCI) [IMAGE]  In the tradition of Stocknight and Stockupticks, we have asked BioSecure to publish its press release after the market closed today so that our members get to see it first and have time to research and decide before the entire market reacts on Monday.   Friday November 16, 9:31 pm Eastern Time   Press Release  SOURCE: Yes Clothing Company Inc.   Yes Clothing Company Inc. Board of Directors Approves   Name Change to BioSecure Corp.   Company to Develop, License and Market Personal Bio-Hazard Protection Products  NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 16, 2001--Yes Clothing Company Inc. (OTCBB:YCCI - news) today announced that the company's board of directors has approved the company's name change from Yes Clothing Company Inc. to BioSecure Corp.    The company intends to identify and develop, license, purchase and market bio-technical and other personal protection products under the name BioSecure Corp.    The name change resolution adopted by the board will be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and  shareholders in accordance with the current proxy rules, within the next few weeks.    All shareholders of record will receive instructions on where to send their existing certificates in exchange for new certificates.  Subject to approval, the company will effect its name change, a corresponding change of CUSIP number and a change in the trading symbol within the next 60 days.    ``The name change will effectively separate the company's historical business from its future activities,'' said Jon Lawver, corporate secretary and director of Yes Clothing. ``The board is enthusiastic about entering this market at a time when the world is on heightened alert and there is an obvious need for personal protection products.    ``The BioSecure name will better represent the personal protection products the company will be developing and marketing.  The recent bio-terrorism events have made it clear that hazardous materials are now part of our daily lives and BioSecure products will be introduced to address everything from anthrax to the more mundane bio-hazards that exist in every business and residence, like copier toner and cleaning products.''    Visit the BioSecure Web site at: http://www.iamprepared.com/ .    About Yes Clothing   Yes Clothing operated a successful woman's wear clothing line under the trade name ``Yes'' until 1997.

But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.  Ken Dilger , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.  Marcus Pollard  , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,  Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Wayne is expected to start in place of ! th! e injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.   Marvin Harrison , WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01 Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.  Peyton Manning , QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.  Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/18/01  Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.  Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.  Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 10/18/01 Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if ! th! e Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.   Laveranues Coles , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01 Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.  Curtis Martin , RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams.   S! te! phen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01 Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01  Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues.   Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01 Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.  Walter Rasby , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01 Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01 Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster.   Trung Canidate , RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 Canidate will ! li! kely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective.   Kurt Warner , QB STL - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive o! f ! the two backs.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01 McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup.   Todd Pinkston , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01 Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point.   Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01 The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.  Chad Lewis , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01 Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

"Saturday 11/17 WX 4KZ","Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd

"","Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flut! ie! and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - G! ig! gles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Up! da! ted 11/20/01  Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler  , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think! c! an help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is! e! xpected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be replaced as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Ru! ss! ell Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 1! 1.!   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Western Power Prices Fall Amid Increased Generation, Weather

     Los Angeles, June 4 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western day-ahead
power prices sank today amid increased hydroelectric generation
from the Grand Coulee generating station and unit restarts, along
with mild weather, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
slumped an average of $68.36 a megawatt-hour to $99.77 amid
trades at $98.00-$100.00. Light-load energy sold at $50.00-
$51.00, an average of $56.48 less than equivalent trades made
Friday for delivery today.
     Reservoir data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shows
that at 1,276.3 feet of water, water levels at Grand Coulee are
about 98.9 percent of capacity.
     Traders said continued mountain run-off into the reservoirs
is causing dam operators to generate electricity to prevent
spilling water over the dam.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak
power traded at $114.00-$140.00, declining $46.76.
     ""Supply is continuing to out-strip demand, the weather is
mild and units are restarting causing more generation available,""
said one Northwest player.
     Southern California Edison Co. 1,080-megawatts San Onofre-3
nuclear plant located in San Clemente, California was confirmed
to be operating at 100 percent capacity, said company officials.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., forecast temperatures in the Pacific Northwest would
average 3.5 degrees below normal over the next 6-10 days and 0.5
degrees above normal in the Southwest.
     In the Southwest, power prices sank an average of $58.45 at
the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $128.96 amid
trades in the $111.00-$140.00 range.

PJM Spot Power Prices Steady With Idled Market Conditions

     Philadelphia, June 4 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Next-day power
prices were little changed at the Western Hub of the Pennsylvania-
New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection this morning, as moderate
temperatures and abundant supply levels continue to depress
marginal pool rates.
     The Interconnection issued a Minimum Generation Alert for the
fourth consecutive day as generation levels fell below the 1,000-
megawatt threshold of normal minimum energy limits.
PJM operating instructions dictate that in situations of
excess capacity, deliveries into the control area are minimized
and where possible, sales to external control areas are arranged.
     ""It's the same story, different day,"" said one PJM based
trader, of today's market. ""Too many megawatts, and nowhere to put
them. There's just not enough demand out there.""
     Locational marginal prices for the four hours leading up to
daily options expiration, or 10 a.m. local time, averaged $20.63
per megawatt hour, with a low and high of $14.00 and $31.00,
respectively. From 2 a.m. to 4 a.m., PJM distributed off-peak
power at no cost.
     Peak power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a
Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $25.80 per megawatt hour, up
only 29 cents from Friday.
     ""This unchanged market is definitely a bearish signal,"" said
one trader. ""Monday typically trades up simply because loads
increase coming out of the weekend. When you can't get a small
rally on a Monday, you know you're in a bear market.""
     Expectations for a continuation in the mild weather pattern
kept balance-of-the-week and next-week packages down as well, with
trades reported at $27.00 and $34.00, respectively.
According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the Northeast U.S. will average 4.0 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal over the next seven days, and 4.1 degrees
below normal over the next 6-10 days.
     Day-ahead values in the New York Power Pool fell across all
three zones, erasing gains made Friday. Traders said a generation
surplus has brought down clearing prices, and in turn next day
values.
     ""Everyone's geared up for summer, with all their generation
available for dispatch, and we've got spring-like weather,"" said
one New York trader. ""The imbalance is taking a severe toll on the
clearing prices.""
     Zone J fell $5.50 to an index price of $47.50, while Zones A
and G slipped $5.25 and $6.50, respectively, to $29.75 and $47.50
indices.

Midwest Spot Power Prices Get Boost From Southern Demand Surge

     Cincinnati, June 4 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Increased weather-
related demand in the lower Mississippi Valley pushed next-day
power prices higher throughout the Mid-Continent U.S., traders
said.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system climbed
$1.75 to $21.39 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $20.00
when the market opened, to $23.00 prior to daily options
expiration.
     ""There's not a whole lot of weather up this way, but we are
feeling a pull from the south,"" said one Ohio-based trader. ""The
Southeast is just about the only area east of the Rockies with
any cooling demand right now.""
     While Weather Services Corp. of Lexington, Massachusetts,
forecast temperatures in Columbus, Ohio, to peak at only 74
degrees Fahrenheit tomorrow, it predicted temperatures in
Jackson, Mississippi, would reach as high as 82.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, for-Tuesday
power at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $1.58
higher on average at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of $22.25,
near parity with Cinergy, which typically trades at a premium.
     ""[Dailies] are trading just above production level, so in
spite of these mild temperatures, there must be one or two buyers
out there,"" said one midwestern trader.
     Next-week packages at ComEd were also discussed higher, at
$36.00-$37.00, on expecations for warmer weather, though few
trades were executed.
     ""They're framing it up higher, mostly in line with the
Cinergy market, but it's not really trading,"" one trader said.
""No one in this market seems anxious to lock in a position right
now; it's too early yet to tell what will happen over the coming
week. These forecasters have been awfully fickle lately.""
     In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, traders said prices
were little changed with stable temperatures and limited trade,
falling 16 cents on average in northern areas to $20.00-$21.00,
while rising 30 cents on average to $19.00-$25.00 in southern
areas.
     ""The phones just aren't ringing,"" said on MAPP trader.
""Until we see some extended heat, I suspect things will stay
quiet, and who knows when that will be.""
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the North-central U.S. will average 4.5 degrees
below normal over the next 7 days, and 2.0 degrees below normal
throughout the next 6-10 days.

Southeast Power Prices Rise Amid Forecasts for Warmer Weather

     Atlanta, June 4 (Bloomberg Energy) - U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices for delivery Tuesday were mostly higher
today as forecasts called for higher temperatures, traders
said.
     Electricity parcels for Wednesday delivery into the
Tennessee Valley Authority transmission grid traded at $24.75-
$25.75 a megawatt hour, with a Bloomberg index rising $1.48
from Friday to $25.18.
     ""Everything is up a little bit today, there is some warmer
weather in the South and loads are increasing,"" said one
Southeast trader.
     In the Nashville, Tennessee area, temperatures were
expected to reach 84 degrees Fahrenheit today, increasing to 85
degrees tomorrow.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price increased
$2.75 from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of $31.07 amid trades
at $23.25-$52.00.
     Traders said the spread between prices in Southern SPP and
Northern SPP was because of zero available transfer capacity.
     In the Southern section of the Southwest Power Pool,
trades for Southern SPP increased $1.50 to a Bloomberg index of
$28.50, with sales completed at $28.00-$29.00. Northern SPP
increased $1.92, with trades between $20.00-$22.00.
     ""Temperatures are high in the Florida markets causing air
conditioning load to increase,"" said one Southeast marketer.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts based Weather
Services Corp., temperatures in Jacksonville, Florida were
expected to peak today at 97 degrees.
     The Bloomberg index price for peak next-day parcels at the
Florida Reliability Coordination Council jumped $22.00 to
$62.00 with trades completed at $58.00-$65.00.
     On the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. grid, peak power
for Tuesday traded between $30.25-$31.00 and averaged $30.65,
$2.65 higher than Friday.

U.K. Spot Power Prices Rise on Outage Concern, Scant Trade

     London, June 4 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. power prices gained
ground today in quiet trade amid rumors of a power plant outage,
traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload traded as low as 16.75 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before rising to at 18.50 pounds a megawatt-hour, 1.5 pounds
higher than Friday's close.
     ""Initially someone sold it (day-ahead) down as low as 16.75,
but there were a lot of natural buyers out there,"" one trader
said.
     Traders reported Connah's Quay, Powergen's 1,400-megawatt
combined-cycle gas turbine power plant had closed because of
technical problems, although this could not be confirmed.
     Week 24 traded 30 pence higher following trades at 17.10
pounds a megawatt-hour.
     September 2001 traded 10 pence higher on the back of the jump
in spot values, dealing at 19.70 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     In the forward market, prices were little changed in limited
trade.
     Winter 2001 reportedly traded 3 times before closing at 21.59
pounds a megawatt-hour, unchanged from Friday.

Nordic Power Prices Gain Ahead of Holiday in Limited Trade

     Lysaker, Norway, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose today
as participants purchased power in order to cover their contracted
requirements ahead of the long-weekend Whit holiday on Monday,
traders said.
     Week 23 closed at 206.18 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour,
gaining 2.18 after 297 megawatts traded. Week 24 jumped 3.5 kroner
to 210.50 kroner a megawatt-hour with 202 megawatts exchanged.
     Prices rose as participants bought contracts in an attempt to
close positions and minimize the risk of changing weather
conditions over the long-weekend, traders said.
     Scandinavian rainfall was forecast to remain above average
over the next 5 days, according to Weather Services Corp. in the
U.S. Still, worries about limited hydro-supply persist following
scarce snow accumulation and melting this year, traders said.
     Saturday's system area average price was set at 188.71 kroner
a megawatt-hour, 17.89 kroner lower than today's spot price,
because of lower industrial demand over the weekend. Traders said
the price was in line with expectations.
     Winter-2, 2001 rose 0.65 kroner to 220.25 kroner a megawatt-
hour after 89.00 megawatts were sold. Winter-1, 2002 jumped 1.25
kroner to 222.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Traded volumes on Nordpool rose to 1,292 gigawatt-hours
generation today from 1,030 gigawatt-hours yesterday.
     Still, activity was lackluster, traders said as many
participants were away from their trading desks ahead of Monday's
holiday.
     The Nordpool Exchange will be closed on Monday June 4 and is
scheduled to reopen on Tuesday.

""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said.   Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks.   He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report.      Amani Toomer  , WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01   According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him.     Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01   Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury.   Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL.      Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear.    Bert Emanuel  , WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up.    Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01   Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.    Germane Crowell  , WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.    Santana Moss  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2.    Brett Favre  , QB GB - Frank Updated 10/24/01   Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts.    Larry Foster  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks.    Marcus Robinson  , WR CHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league.    Neil Rackers  , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play.    Todd Pinkston  , WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01   Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis.     Ron Dixon  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week.    Joe Jurevicius  , WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/24/01   Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo.       Darrin Chiaverini  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury.     Raghib Ismail  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01   Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game.     Ricky Watters  , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.    Trent Dilfer  , QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.    Matt Hasselbeck  , QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01   Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.    Wayne Chrebet  , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.    Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.    Lamar Smith  , RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01   Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Marvin Minnis  , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.    Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01   Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.    Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01   Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.    Terrell Davis  , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01   Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.    More Updates    Player News Teams   [IMAGE]   Neal/McKay Player News    Lamar Smith  , Active RB Updated 10/23/01  Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.    Az-Zahir Hakim  , Active WR Updated 10/23/01  Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans.    Tony Richardson  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Richardson (shoulder) did play against the Cardinals. He was used in goal-line packages and had one carry and one reception for 24 total yards. He will probably be used sparingly as a runner now that Priest Holmes has clearly emerged as a featured back.    Tiki Barber  , Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01  Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.    Freddie Jones  , Reserve TE Updated 10/22/01  Jones sprained his ankle against Denver. His current status is day to day.    Vinny Testaverde  , Reserve QB Updated 10/21/01  Testaverde was replaced by Chad Pennington in the second half of Sunday's game against St. Louis. The move wasn't injury related, but simply Jets' coach Herm Edwards giving Pennington some playing time in a blowout game. Testaverde finished the afternoon 9-of-13 for 74 yards with a touchdown and an interception.    Mike Anderson  , Active RB Updated 10/19/01  Anderson may find it difficult to reach 100 yards against the Chargers. San Diego has a strong front seven, and the Broncos are having trouble with blocking on end runs.    Peyton Manning  , Active QB Updated 10/18/01  Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.    Ron Dayne  , Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01  Dayne has emerged as New York's main threat in the backfield, and has been relatively productive in the role. Even with Tiki Barber back in the mix, we expect Dayne to get the majority of the carries in the game. He'll have a tough time running on the Eagles' defense, however, be he's still worth starting in deeper Fantasy leagues.    Keenan McCardell  , Active WR Updated 10/17/01  McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes.    Jerry Rice  , Active WR Updated 10/12/01  Rice should have another good outing. He should draw inexperienced Indianapolis CB David Macklin in coverage, which means Rice will definitely be a TD threat again this week.    Shawn Bryson  , Reserve RB Updated 08/23/01  Bryson suffered a sprained ankle during practice on Thursday. He was scheduled to have X-rays later in the day, but the team has diagnosed it as a simple sprain at this point. Bryson, who will be a game-time decision for this weekend's game at Cincinnati, is worth a later-round flier at best on Draft Day.    Broncos  , Active DT Updated 08/23/01  Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton, who suffered a slight ligament tear in his knee during Monday's preseason game, is expected to be ready for the start of the regular season. Denver's defense has the talent to be a solid unit from a Fantasy perspective, and will be one of the top ten defenses taken on Draft Day.    Matt Stover  , Active K Updated 12/08/00  Stover needs just nine more field goals over the final three weeks of the season to break the NFL single-season record of 39 (Olindo Mare, 1999). Expect him to get plenty of chances against San Diego on Sunday, and ensure that he's in your active playoff lineup each week.   [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"FW: TE Critical System Warning","FYI

-----Original Message-----
From: infopost@duke-energy.com [mailto:infopost@duke-energy.com]

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

Subject:	Scott Neal East desk meeting

Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 

List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 

In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 

Tks - Bob

"Institutional Sentiment & Analysis 1/26/02","Results of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll taken after the close on 1/25

Response was to this question: ""At the end of next week will the S & P 500
close up (bull), down (bear), or unchanged/no opinion (neutral)?""

IT BULLS:	28%
IT BEARS:	40%

Our `Smart Money' Poll was twice as Bullish as Bearish and Neutral.

The Senticator is Bearish.

Last week, we said that our read was that we would find room to rally this
week, but overall, the trend was down so once the oversold condition was
corrected, the market could decline. This week, we have a mixed bag but it
looks like our comments from last week can be recycled. The ""Smart Money""
is fairly Bullish, and we really haven't worked off much of the short-term
pessimism yet. The Senticator is Bearish, and so are the Fearless Forecasters.

We don't have a ton of confidence in our read, but our guess is that we see
a bit of strength to make the ""Smart Money"" guys feel good, but by the end
of the week we are heading south as the Senticator and Fearless Forecasters
predict. This is a very odd market, we must say, short term, and sentiment
is giving very mixed signals, as measured by Rydex Ratios and the VIX.
Investors Intelligence shows quite a few more Bulls at 52.4%, which
suggests that we have more downside from here than upside.

Big picture, as before, we believe the recent dead-even Bull and Bear
readings from the Fearless Forecasters, as well as the AAII and Investors
Intelligence sentiment readings indicate that a Top of Intermediate
Proportions is in.

See www.Traders-Talk.com in the Market Analysis area for a historical chart
of the
FF sentiment.

ABOUT SENTIMENT AND ANALYSIS

The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll is taken each Friday from a
generally static pool of experienced technical analysts (both private and
professional). The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment is not normally a good
fade, though there are times when it can be.

The Fearless Forecaster sentiment data is useful on the short term; the
Fearless Forecasters tend to be right. Typically they are right sooner
rather than later, if there's a large plurality. On the flip side of the
equation, if 90% or more are Bullish or Bearish, the odds of them being
right over the very short term are huge, but the odds of a major turn (in
the opposite direction) soon thereafter are also quite good.

We have also found that when the Fearless Forecasters are evenly split,
look for a BIG move in either direction, but usually down.

Over the years, we have found a number of other tools to help in evaluating
the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment. We publish this in our weekly
""Institutional Sentiment & Analysis"" (a part of our institutional
research). These additional tools are our ""Smart Money"" poll, and our
Senticator. Both are proprietary polls run by us.

We have found that the Senticator tends to be right by the end of the week
(as much as 87% of the time), though it tends to be more accurate in a
rising market than a falling one.

The ""Smart Money"" pollees are very useful when there is divergent opinion.
It's generally NOT a good idea to fade the ""Smart Money"" unless
""'EVERYONE'"" (all sentiment measures) is in agreement. When in doubt about
the meaning of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll, defer to the ""Smart
Money"" poll. The ""Smart Money"" guys are folks with whom I've worked or whom
I've watched for YEARS. They all have different approaches and they're all
VERY good (not infallible, just good analysts/traders).

"Pre-Flight Fund Trader 2/5/02","Pre Flight Fund Trader for 2/5/02
Monday 2/4/02
*********************************
Real Money Seasonal Trading Account (New! All weightings are approximate)
80% Money Market
5% HGMCY (Harmony Gold).
30% Rydex Tempest Fund.
We are more than a little bit short and and happy. The trend had broken and the market could easily fall out of bed. Still, we'd expect a little bounce. We were right about not dumping Harmony Gold. We only wish we'd bought our other favorite DROOY as well.
Our managed tracking account is up 16.98% for the 18 months since June 30, 2000. This is a very conservative approach (~1/3 the risk of the market), using both long and short funds as well as the occasional favored sector/stock idea. All performance is net of fees, commissions, and interest. Your results may vary, and standard disclaimers may apply. We DO use discretion. For further information, call us now. 
Active Model
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 10/2.
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 10/3.
Bot 33% Profunds Ultra Bear 11/15.
The market is driving us nuts, but the trend has turned. We have committed, perhaps foolishly, to holding this one. Cover all positions if we print 1065.
Hedged Model
50% Waterhouse Dow Fund (WDOWX)
25% Profunds Ultra Bear
Watch out for a memo. We may increase our Ultra Bear exposure.
The MACD is negative, and the Weekly MACD is negative. The Seasonal Cycle is positive, but now less so. We are Bears.
VIX Trader
Flat.
Sold 1/2 position in Profunds Ultra Bull from 1/16 a/o 1/31.
**********************************
Last time, I said that the trend was still down and I continue to call for the recent lows to be taken out. So far, so good. Yesterday, I also pointed out the potential for both weakness and a potential reversal if we got that weakness early in the week. We got it, so now I have to look for a bounce. Things really didn't get THAT overdone, however, so IF the market rallies, I'll be inclined to short it.
One thing that makes me look for a possible rally is the ARMS (aka the TRIN). This indicator measures not only how many issues are trading down, but how much volume is being sold vs. bought. This indicator can tell us a lot about the flow of money. In this instance it also tells us that there has been excessive selling today. The ARMS Index went out at 2.53 today, and I've learned from experience to expect at least a one day bounce when that happens. The VIX, as I'm sure others have noted, is also relatively high. This too supports a short term rally. Thereafter, however, we have to continue to respect the trend. It's down. Period. The VIX is NOT at excessive levels, so any rally has to be viewed as a place to sell.
There is plenty of room to fall. I would avoid all longer-term long positions until AT LEAST the 1060 area. The earnings fiascoes are creating a crisis of confidence. This won't go away easily. Mutual funds don't have that much cash on hand, either, and if redemptions begin to rise, they could be in deep trouble. So could this market. Don't get too bearish, but be alert for the worse case scenario to develop over the coming weeks. I'm not predicting it, but forewarned is forearmed.
We have to love our shorts, at this juncture.
***************************************

*********************************************

Latest Findings from Meridien:

1. From Policy to Practice: Privacy Management Solutions
(Customer Relationship Management/Customer Interaction Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=819
This is the third Meridien report in a series that deals with privacy issues worldwide. Advanced technology has made customer data more mobile than ever. Financial institutions analyze, transmit, and store sensitive customer data every day to deliver products and services to their customers in an efficient and effective manner. But technological advancements have also created an environment in which financial institutions can sell customer data to third parties or inadequately protect customer information. Regulators may stipulate which data can be collected and how it can be used, but customers may have their own set of stipulations. It is up to the institution to balance these demands. This report defines privacy management and examines three vendors offering privacy management middleware solutions.

2. XML: Are We Speaking the Same Language?
(Wholesale e-Financial Client Access)
(Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access)
(Retail e-Financial Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=820

Technologists may not be uttering ""XML"" with quite the battle-cry zeal they did last year, but XML standardization efforts trudge on. XML remains a crucial consideration for organizations as they make their technology decisions. This report updates a previous Meridien report on XML, which focused largely on the business-to-business marketplace arena. Much of the immense market push in that direction has slowed along with the rest of the economy. In the meantime, belt-tightening and budget scrutiny are leading many institutions to pursue internal initiatives that can for now bring them more immediate and assured return on investment than might more outwardly focused, multi-institution efforts. This report updates some of the standardization efforts and provides some new coverage in an effort to shed light on the areas where the financial industry will more than likely focus in the next several years.

3. Buy-Side OMS: Several Steps Closer to STP
(Emerging Trading Technologies Client Access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/doc.asp?docid=823

Order management systems, or OMSs, facilitate the intrafirm processing of securities trading. The growth and acceptance of processing power and networking technologies have allowed OMSs to expand beyond simple order management. This growth has encouraged the centralization of several front-, middle-, and back-office and compliance functionalities into one solution. As straight-through processing becomes more important for firms, an OMS offers a relatively easy and proven way of starting down this road. This report examines the components of an OMS, various vendors providing OMS solutions, the OMS marketplace, and how a buy-side firm uses OMS technology.

4. Top Ten Strategic IT Initiatives in Wholesale Financial Services for 2002
(Guest access)
http://www.meridien-research.com/misc/top10_2002.asp

Meridien Research's third annual IT analysis identifies the top ten initiatives that will have key strategic importance for the wholesale financial services industry in 2002. This special report summarizes and forecasts spending on these initiatives, considering industry segment and geographic region.

5. Top Ten Wholesale for 2002 Web cast
Wednesday, January 30, 2002; 11AM
Presenter: Bill Bradway
(Open to the public)
http://www.meridien-research.com/events/webcast/
This Web cast, based on our recently released report, will identify what Meridien believes will be the top ten initiatives having key strategic importance for the wholesale financial services industry in 2002.

"Market Data Contracts","Everyone,

We are in the process of creating new contracts with UBS for all Market Data real-time applications, subscriptions and publications.  Attached is a comprehensive list of all contracts that will be renegotiated under the UBS name for use by the Gas and Power trading entities.  

In order to leverage UBS' significant discounts and avoid duplicate efforts, Danielle Marcinkowski with Market Data will be the initial point of contact when inquiring about the addition or status of applications or publications.  I bring this to your attention because we understand that several groups have initiated discussions with the various vendors over the past few days.  

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at 713-853-9358 or Danielle at 713-853-7926.  If you think something is missing from the list, please bring it to our attention immediately.  Please pass this word around within your group as appropriate.

Regards,

Chris Behney

    Dear  Amazon Customer,  Since you  haven't shopped with us recently (using this e-mail address), we wanted to  make sure you knew about our new  Father's  Day Store . We're celebrating Dad's big day with some super deals and  smart savings on electronics, tools and hardware, books, and lots more.    Whether  Dad's a backyard griller or a workshop driller--or somewhere in between,  like me--you'll find unique gift ideas, custom recommendations, and even  some handsome gift-wrap for that final touch. Or for the Dad who has  everything, give the gift of choice--send him a  gift  certificate  through the mail or with a fun e-card.

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook

     Palatka, Florida, June 2 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas is
burning again at Florida Power & Light Co.'s Putnam power plant in
Palatka.
     Last winter, Florida's largest utility reconfigured the plant
to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel
that for years had been comparatively cheap. Last month, as gas
prices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.
     Florida Power & Light wasn't the only one. Many electric
utilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several are
making the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in some
regions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oil
since the winter.
     ``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gas
and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that the
switch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager of
fuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been running
its 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last
December.
     Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per million
British thermal units in late December, more than quadruple the
year-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partly
because last year's rally caused so many generators and industrial
customers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.

                           Saving Money

     Fuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant's
operating costs, according to some estimates.
     Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demand
for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while record
drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.
wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas into
underground storage at almost three times last year's rate,
according to American Gas Association figures.
     Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6
residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in power
plants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4
percent this year.
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut
crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times
in 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent
months to make gasoline for the summer driving season.
     Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell below
fuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time it
was cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloomberg
figures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.
     ``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, a
spokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parent
of Florida Power & Light, which can switch about a quarter of its
power plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We are
detecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are going
back to gas.''

                          Fear of a Rally

     To be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary of
switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this
summer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in
New York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses will
turn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher and
lifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29
percent.
     Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about
25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,
according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.
Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,
boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3
percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.
     Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any
heat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf
of Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for
a quarter of U.S. production.
     ``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They're
wondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it's
just going to turn around and do to them what it did last
winter.''

                           Still Cheaper

     Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the New
York City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to get
oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fuel
oil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for natural
gas, according to Bloomberg figures.
     Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, New
York-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of its
total power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesman
David Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point last
December.
     Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burning
gas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power for
about 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
     ``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enough
to switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,
he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more
this summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''

October 24, 2001 

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

Many of you received the attachment below directly from Dave Forster.  In order to prepare for NewCo coming back online, we are going to use this list as the starting point to identify the ""primary launch customers"".  To that end please review this list and confirm that ALL of your primary counterparties are listed.  After Christmas, we will meet to reform the list by region and assign individual responsibilities.  The single objective of this effort is to confirm that we have every client identified as we move forward and further develop our launch strategy.

Thanks and Merry Christmas

Frank,

Attached is the file from Forster.  As we discussed, it would be great if you could take the US Gas list and get regions and names next to each counterparty.  Probably best to show it to Luce, Tycholiz, Lagrasta, Redmond and then the relevant traders - Arnold, Hunter, Allen, Neal.

First couple of days in the new year we will want to convene to plan with credit, legal and Louise.

Attached, please find a spreadsheet showing customers with:

- Global Counterparty ID (useful for subsequent info requests)
- Credit Headroom limit (specific to the date the report was run)
- Master Contract Name and Type
- Enron Entity on the contract
- Master Contract Number
- Rank by total value transacted in each of CDN Gas, CDN Power, US Gas, US Power, CDN Financial, US Financial
- Actual Notional value transacted during Q3

This will hopefully provide a good guide to assist in Master contract negotiations

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.

Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.

Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month

Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Subject:	RE: how did your meeting w/ the lawyers go?

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

Bob

January 17, 2002


To: S-2 Customers

Re: TETCO Electric Power Cost Adjustment Effective 02/01/02

On December 27, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP02-131 to 
reflect its Electric Power Cost Adjustment.  Included in the 
filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate Schedule X-28 which 
Transco uses to render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The 
revised rates have a proposed effective date of February 1, 2002, 
and if accepted as proposed would result in the following changes 
in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates: 

Demand Rate - $0.0270 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0021 increase
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0008 increase

Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department, at 
(713) 215-2424.

He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game.    Derrick Alexander  , WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/25/01   Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets.    James Hodgins  , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.     Dave Stachelski  , TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards.     Michael Bennett  , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week.     Todd Heap  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week.     Anthony Thomas  , RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/25/01   Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report.     Kevin Swayne  , WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week.     Reggie Swinton  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy.     Dedric Ward  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury.     Terry Allen  , RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/25/01   Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive.     Jason Brookins  , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report.     Shannon Sharpe  , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report.     Freddie Jones  , TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/25/01   Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report.     Hines Ward  , WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/25/01   Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable.     Joey Galloway  , WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game.     Charlie Batch  , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals.     O.J. McDuffie  , WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury.     Terrence Wilkins  , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs.     Jerome Pathon  , WR IND - Tori Updated 10/25/01   Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup.     Terry Glenn  , WR NE - Matty Updated 10/25/01   Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday.     Drew Bledsoe  , QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills.     Chad Morton  , RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain.     Marco Battaglia  , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit.     Chad Johnson  , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence.     Chris Sanders  , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.     Tyrone Wheatley  , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/25/01   Wheatley did not practice Wednesday because of a wrist and knee injuries, but head coach Jon Gruden told The Contra Costa Times that he is making progress. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Eagles.     Keyshawn Johnson  , WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/25/01   Johnson ran in the morning and afternoon but did not practice Wednesday, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Johnson is recovering from hip and thigh injuries but is expected to play Sunday.     Jacquez Green  , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01   Green is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Minnesota. He is recovering from a groin strain. Frank Murphy will replace Green at receiver if he is unable to play.     Warrick Dunn  , RB TB - Martin Updated 10/25/01   Dunn participated in running drills Wednesday and did not have any setbacks in his recovery from a toe injury, according to The St. Petersburg Times . Nevertheless, Dunn is still listed as questionable for this week's game against Minnesota.

Market Insight for February 4, 2002	
[IMAGE]	
 [IMAGE] Economic Recovery to the  Rescue By Arnie Kaufman, Editor, The  Outlook 	


Stay  with a positive investment approach. 	
 Corporate  accounting and earnings quality issues, high P/Es and fear of additional  terrorism remain a drag on the market. Another restraint: Dynamic  leadership is absent and may not be seen until signs of improvement in  information technology spending breathe new life into that deeply  depressed sector.  But barring  dramatic new financial irregularity disclosures, the chances are good the  market will soon start moving forward again. The driving force, we  believe, will be an improving economy.  S&P  chief economist David Wyss feels that if inventory rebuilding accelerates  sharply in the period just ahead, it is possible the first quarter will  show strong GDP growth and the second quarter a relapse into negative  territory. He points out that the 1990-91 recession was the only one since  the 1950s that did not have a positive quarter sandwiched between down  quarters. Wyss thinks the more likely scenario, however, is a smoother  pace of inventory accumulation and rising quarter-to-quarter GDP growth  through 2002. This forecast implies upward-trending earnings this year and  next.  Investors,  burned badly by the 2000-2001 bear market, are in a show-me state of mind.  Short sellers and others who bet stocks will fall have become bolder  lately, and institutions have been moving cautiously. All of this suggests  that a good deal of fuel for an advance exists.   It wasn't a  good omen that the S&P 500 index slipped in January, losing 1.6%. As  mentioned a week ago, of the 19 times in the postwar period that the ""500""  has fallen in January, the index then went on to score a gain for the full  year only seven times and suffered a loss for the year 12 times. That was  against a backdrop of 2.4 up years for each down year for the 56 years  from 1946 through 2001.   On the  other hand, a decline in the S&P 500 this year would be the third in a  row, and that hasn't happened since  1941.

"Institutional Sentiment & Analysis 1/19/02","Results of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll taken after the close on 1/18

Response was to this question: ""At the end of next week will the S & P 500
close up (bull), down (bear), or unchanged/no opinion (neutral)?""

IT BULLS:	45%
IT BEARS:	36%

Our `Smart Money' Poll was twice as Bullish as neutral and not at all Bearish.

The Senticator is rather Bullish.

Last week, we said that while it was not so easy for us give a solid read
on the market. Still we figured that if we got some weakness early, and was
met with excessive put buying or other signs of pessimism, we'd expect some
sort of rally by or into Friday. We got a little bit of weakness and a
little bit of rally, but the market was significantly weaker than one might
have imagined going into expiration. Of course, since we reiterated our
stance that an Intermediate-term Top was in or close to being in, the
weakness would not have come as a complete surprise.

This week, the Fearless Forecasters are more Bullish than Bearish, and the
""Smart Money"" Guys are 66% Bullish and not at all Bearish, plus the
Senticator is rather Bullish so we have to favor a rally. Sentiment is
getting a bit bearish, all over. The VIX (CBOE Volatility Index) and the
Rydex Ratios show a fairly marked increase in Bears, which also supports a
bounce.

Our read is that we do find a bit of room to rally next week, probably
early in the week. Overall, however, the trend has now turned down so once
the oversold condition is corrected, the market can decline. Sentiment is
nowhere near where we'd want to see it for an IT low.

Big picture, as before, we believe the recent dead-even Bull and Bear
readings from the Fearless Forecasters, as well as the AAII and Investors
Intelligence sentiment readings indicate that a Top of Intermediate
Proportions is in.

FF sentiment.

ABOUT SENTIMENT AND ANALYSIS

The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll is taken each Friday from a
generally static pool of experienced technical analysts (both private and
professional). The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment is not normally a good
fade, though there are times when it can be.

The Fearless Forecaster sentiment data is useful on the short term; the
Fearless Forecasters tend to be right. Typically they are right sooner
rather than later, if there's a large plurality. On the flip side of the
equation, if 90% or more are Bullish or Bearish, the odds of them being
right over the very short term are huge, but the odds of a major turn (in
the opposite direction) soon thereafter are also quite good.

We have also found that when the Fearless Forecasters are evenly split,
look for a BIG move in either direction, but usually down.

Over the years, we have found a number of other tools to help in evaluating
the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment. We publish this in our weekly
""Institutional Sentiment & Analysis"" (a part of our institutional
research). These additional tools are our ""Smart Money"" poll, and our
Senticator. Both are proprietary polls run by us.

We have found that the Senticator tends to be right by the end of the week
(as much as 87% of the time), though it tends to be more accurate in a
rising market than a falling one.

The ""Smart Money"" pollees are very useful when there is divergent opinion.
It's generally NOT a good idea to fade the ""Smart Money"" unless
""'EVERYONE'"" (all sentiment measures) is in agreement. When in doubt about
the meaning of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll, defer to the ""Smart
Money"" poll. The ""Smart Money"" guys are folks with whom I've worked or whom
I've watched for YEARS. They all have different approaches and they're all
VERY good (not infallible, just good analysts/traders).

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

"Institutional Sentiment & Analysis 1/12/02","Results of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll taken after the close on 1/11

Response was to this question: ""At the end of next week will the S & P 500
close up (bull), down (bear), or unchanged/no opinion (neutral)?""

IT BULLS:	31%
IT BEARS:	58%

Our `Smart Money' Poll was 100% Bearish.

The Senticator is Bullish.

Last week, we said that sentiment was suggesting that we had a top coming
last week. We came right out and called it-- a top for last week, ""Probably
before Wednesday."" We nailed it, and we're going to take credit for it. We
know it was a tough one to trade, because we were shorting it too, but we
as accurate as one can get in a weekly report. Going forward, however, may
not be so easy for us.

This week, the Fearless Forecasters are heavily Bearish, and the ""Smart
Money"" Guys are 100% Bearish, so we have to favor some weakness, at least
early.

That said, we ought not forget the Senticator. It's Bullish. Next week is
options expiration, so if we get some weakness early, and it's met with
excessive put buying or other signs of pessimism, we'd expect some sort of
rally by or into Friday. We'll try to fine tune this for our regular
subscribers by watching the VIX and Rydex Ratios.

Big picture, we believe the recent dead-even Bull and Bear readings from
the Fearless Forecasters, as well as the AAII and Investors Intelligence
sentiment readings indicate that a Top of Intermediate Proportions is
either in, or about to come in.

Mark Young

See www.Traders-Talk.com in the Market Analysis area for a historical chart
of the
FF sentiment.

ABOUT SENTIMENT AND ANALYSIS

The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll is taken each Friday from a
generally static pool of experienced technical analysts (both private and
professional). The Fearless Forecaster Sentiment is not normally a good
fade, though there are times when it can be.

The Fearless Forecaster sentiment data is useful on the short term; the
Fearless Forecasters tend to be right. Typically they are right sooner
rather than later, if there's a large plurality. On the flip side of the
equation, if 90% or more are Bullish or Bearish, the odds of them being
right over the very short term are huge, but the odds of a major turn (in
the opposite direction) soon thereafter are also quite good.

We have also found that when the Fearless Forecasters are evenly split,
look for a BIG move in either direction, but usually down.

Over the years, we have found a number of other tools to help in evaluating
the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment. We publish this in our weekly
""Institutional Sentiment & Analysis"" (a part of our institutional
research). These additional tools are our ""Smart Money"" poll, and our
Senticator. Both are proprietary polls run by us.

We have found that the Senticator tends to be right by the end of the week
(as much as 87% of the time), though it tends to be more accurate in a
rising market than a falling one.

The ""Smart Money"" pollees are very useful when there is divergent opinion.
It's generally NOT a good idea to fade the ""Smart Money"" unless
""'EVERYONE'"" (all sentiment measures) is in agreement. When in doubt about
the meaning of the Fearless Forecaster Sentiment Poll, defer to the ""Smart
Money"" poll. The ""Smart Money"" guys are folks with whom I've worked or whom
I've watched for YEARS. They all have different approaches and they're all
VERY good (not infallible, just good analysts/traders).

"FW: FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again","
fyi.
 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Cantrell, Rebecca  
Sent:	Tuesday, June 05, 2001 11:17 AM
To:	Fletcher, Brenda H.; McMichael Jr., Ed; Smith, George F.; Muhl, Gil; Townsend, Judy; Olinger, Kimberly S.; Tate, Paul; Superty, Robert; Concannon, Ruth; Calcagno, Suzanne; Lamadrid, Victor
Subject:	FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again

FYI.



NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : June 5, 2001 FERC Rejects FTW Rates for Transco -- Again  Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. last week struck out again in its eight-year effort to obtain firm-to-the-wellhead (FTW) transportation rates similar to those enjoyed by its competitors.  Responding to a remand from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, the Commission after conducting a ""detailed review"" upheld its earlier rejection of Transco's bid to levy two-part FTW rates on distribution customers served by the pipeline's production-area mainline [RP92-137-050, RP93-136]. It concluded that the FTW rate structure would force distributors to pay for service that's not included in their contracts with Transco. Therefore, Transco's existing IT-feeder transportation rates for service on its supply laterals will remain in force.  The ""fundamental issue"" in this ""long and somewhat tortuous"" case is: who should pay the fixed costs of Transco's supply laterals -- 1) the producers and marketers who contract for service on the supply laterals and currently pay all of the fixed costs; or 2) Transco's firm transportation customers (distributors) who converted from bundled sales to transportation on the pipeline's mainline? The producers and marketers, who transport gas on Transco's supply laterals, favor a switch to a two-part FTW rate structure because it would lighten their fixed-cost burden. Transco advocates the rate shift because it believes this would encourage more producers to attach their supplies to its system. But the pipeline's distributor customers are opposed to being charged FTW rates on supply laterals, which they don't use.  FERC agreed with Transco's distributor customers -- who it calls FT-conversion customers -- in its remand decision. After conducting a lengthy examination, ""we conclude that the FT- conversion customers' firm contracts [distributors] with Transco do not include service on the supply laterals. Rather, the producers and marketers contract and pay for the IT-feeder service [on the laterals],"" last week's order noted.

"Enron plans to oppose Dynegy in FERC power issue","A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Western Power Prices Jump as Hot Weather Propels Demand

     Portland, Oregon, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Western
peak power prices for delivery Thursday jumped amid expectations
for strong weather-related demand tomorrow, traders said.
     National Weather Service forecasts for the Portland, Oregon,
vicinity call for temperatures to approach 90 degrees Fahrenheit
tomorrow, up 12 degrees from today's projected high.
     ""It's going to be very, very hot tomorrow,"" said one western
day-ahead power trader. ""Frankly, I'm surprised that prices
didn't move even higher.""
     The western trader said the fact that it's the end of the
month and cooler weather was expected for the weekend caused many
power marketers and utilities to buy the minimum energy required
to take them through tomorrow's peak demand periods.
     According to the California Independent System Operator,
demand in the state will peak tomorrow at 36,229 megawatts, up
588 megawatts from today's 35,641-megawatt forecast demand.
     At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, power
sales were noted between $150.00 and $200.00 a megawatt-hour,
with the majority of trades done at a Bloomberg index of $154.62,
$32.77 more than equivalent trades done yesterday for delivery
today. Light load NP-15 trades were heard at $62.00-$104.00,
$35.90 more than yesterday.
     ""Everything just kept ticking up as more and more people
came into the market to buy,"" said one Northwest power trader
about today's next-day market activity.  ""I think tomorrow will
trade lower though, because it's for a two-day (Friday-Saturday)
package and it's the beginning of a new month.""
     Mid-Columbia power for June delivery traded at $245-$255 per
megawatt-hour, up from $220-$240 yesterday.
     In the Mid-Columbia cash markets, power for tomorrow started
trade at $145 and traded as high as $210 near daily options
expiry.
     Traders said the fact that the Grand Coulee reservoir is
near capacity at 12,709 feet of water was reassuring, though
continued load curtailments in California will be necessary to
keep prices from skyrocketing to the $500 a megawatt-hour level
like they did in early May.
     California traders said next-day markets were largely driven
by advancing prices in the hourly cash markets, where several
trades were noted in the $180-$200 range.
     At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, power for tomorrow
averaged $164.59, $37.38 more than yesterday. Traders said
Phoenix temperatures in the 107-110 degrees Fahrenheit range were
expected to keep demand strong in the Southwest through the
weekend.

PJM Spot Power Prices Continue to Fall on Scant Demand

     Philadelphia, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead power
prices fell again in the Northeast U.S. this morning, pulled
lower by continued expectations for minimal weather-related
demand and higher generation levels, traders said.
     According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,
temperatures in the region will average 5 degrees Fahrenheit
below normal over the next seven days, keeping energy useage for
cooling 90 percent below normal.
     ""These low temperatures just can't support a bull market,""
said one Northeast trader. ""It's weighing heavily on the power
and [natural] gas markets alike. Too many megawatts, and not
enough heat.""
     Nuclear Regulatory Commission data shows Northeast nuclear
output at 98 percent, with New England and New York both
operating at 100 percent capacity, and PJM at 96 percent.
     Next-day values in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland
Interconnection fell $3.90 to a Bloomberg volume-weighted index
of $24.05 per megawatt hour and a new intra-month low.
     The daily index is 64.6 percent below the May high, $67.99,
reached May 2.
     Traders said next-week packages sold in mass, as revised
weather forecasts and plummeting natural gas values prompted many
to shed excess generation for that period. The June 4-June 8
block sold as high as $55.00 yesterday and as low as $40.50
today.
     June and summer strips traded down $8.00 and $5.00,
respectively, to $47.00 and $78.00.
     ""They're trading the curve like we're going to see 70-degree
temperatures all summer,"" said one PJM-based trader.
""Temperatures are actually supposed to be near normal, and near
normal isn't all that bad.  You'll see some good cooling loads on
80-something degree days.""
     Weather Services Corporation of Lexington, Massachusetts,
said in its long range forecast that the Northeast will see no
significant departures from normal temperatures throughout the
next 90 days. Normal high temperatures in Philadelphia during
June, July and August are 81, 86 and 84 degrees, respectively.
     New England day-ahead values slipped an additional $3.25, to
an index of $36.50, and in New York, Zone J traded as low as
$48.00, with an index price of $48.75.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop Again; Mild Weather to Continue

     Cincinnati, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent
peak spot power prices continued to decline today as unseasonably
cool weather was expected to suppress demand through the weekend,
traders said.
     Bloomberg data shows day-ahead prices have declined to new
lows for the calendar year at major trading hubs eight of the
last nine days as temperatures across the region have ranged from
5-10 degrees Fahrenheit below normal.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Wednesday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system fell $1.19
to $17.61 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $16.50 up to
$20.00.
     East Central Area Reliability Council traders said prices at
the hub were so low activity was limited almost exclusively to
financial-based deals. They said the late price rise came as
marketers scrambled to cover earlier sales.
     ""No utilities will mess with Cinergy at this point; it's
just too low for them to make any money,"" an ECAR trader said.
     Short-term over-the-counter prices also fell, as 6-10 day
weather forecasts were revised cooler, traders said. Cinergy
parcels for delivery from June 4-8 were offered about $18.00 less
than yesterday at $40.75 and power for the entire month of June
at $46.75.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, for-Thursday
parcels into the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.81
less on average at $14.00-$19.00 and power in lower MAIN 17 cents
less at $18.00-$24.00.
     MAIN traders said increased nuclear generation in the ComEd
service area drove prices at the hub to the lowest levels in the
region, as MAIN has the most nuclear capacity in the Mid-
Continent region and nuclear plants can produce electricity for
the lowest cost of any generator type.
     Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak day-ahead power prices
fell an average of $1.12 in the northern half of the region to
$20.00-$22.50 and $1.45 in southern areas to $21.00-$24.00.
     MAPP traders said mild weather also pulled prices down in
that region, though exports to the Southwest Power Pool and the
lack of a financial market kept prices above those seen in
markets to the east.
     ""I think we've bottomed out,"" one trader said. ""Out here,
things can't go much under $20 or we're going be below cost.""

Most Southeast Power Prices Fall With Natural Gas, Mild Weather

     Atlanta, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) - Most U.S. Southeast
spot electricity prices for power delivered Thursday declined
today because of falling natural gas prices and moderate
weather, traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price declined 17
cents a megawatt-hour from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$28.21 amid trades in the $16.00-$52.00 range.
     ""There is no demand in this market. This market is driven
by the weather, and with milder temperatures and declining
natural gas, day-ahead power prices are falling,'' said one
Southeast trader.
     In Texas, traders said day-ahead firm ""UB'' power in the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas sold at a Bloomberg index
of $35.13, falling $2.95 from yesterday. Trades were completed
in the forward market for June at $55.50.
     Traders said declining natural gas also cause prices to
fall.
     According to Bloomberg Energy Service surveys, Gulf Coast
natural gas prices averaged $3.59-$3.66 per million British
thermal units, 18 cents less than yesterday.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp., daily high temperatures in Richmond, Virginia,
were expected to reach 76 degrees Fahrenheit today and 78
degrees tomorrow.
     Forecasters call for temperatures in the Southeast to
average about 1.7 degrees Fahrenheit below normal over the next
seven days.
     In the Virginia-Carolina region, peak power declined $2.33
to a Bloomberg index of $23.50, with trades completed between
$22.00-$25.00.
     Traders said that prices should remain flat or decline for
the rest of this week, though prices should rise as weather
turns warmer next week.
     The Bloomberg index price for power on the New Orleans-
based Entergy Corp. grid for delivery tomorrow slumped $8.33 to
$26.75, with sales between $25.00-$30.00.
     In the Florida markets, prices rose as weather remained
warm and humidity high, increasing energy demand for air
cooling.
     ""Even though temperatures in Florida are in the 80's, air
conditioning load is up because the humidity is unbearable,''
one Florida power marketer said.
     At the Florida Reliability Coordination Council, peak
power jumped $15.25, with trades confirmed between $55.00-
$58.00.

U.K. Seasonal Contracts Rise on Profit Taking; Spot Values Drop

     London, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. power prices for
seasonal delivery climbed today amid active trading as
participants sold contracts to take profit from an earlier rally.
""It was a traders market today. We started off with a rally
and then players came in to cut and take profit,'' one trader
said.
     Winter 2001 baseload last traded at 21.58 pounds a megawatt-
hour, 10 pence higher than yesterday.
     The contract traded as high as 21.66 pounds a megawatt-hour,
before participants began selling excess power, traders said.
     Another trader said around 6 participants were active in the
winter contract today, more than has been typical lately.
     Traders said other seasonal contracts also rose today, buoyed
by strong values for winter power.
     Summer 2002 baseload rose 10 pence from yesterday, having
last traded at 18.45 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     In contrast to the forward market, spot values fell today as
mild weather lessened heating demand.
     Week 23 parcels traded as high as 18.00 pounds a megawatt-
hour, before last trading at 17.75 pounds a megawatt-hour, 30
pence lower than yesterday.

Nordic Power Steady in Afternoon Trade; Supply Worries Persist

     Lysaker, Norway, May 30 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed
little changed today following continued worries of limited hydro-
supply after the publication of weekly water tank levels, traders
said.
     Winter-2, 2001 closed 0.25 Norwegian kroner lower after
146.00 megawatts were exchanged between 219.50-220.40 kroner a
megawatt-hour. Winter-1, 2002 closed at 221.00 kroner a megawatt-
hour with 71.00 megawatts sold.
     At the end of week 21, Norwegian reservoirs rose a lower-
than-expected 3.6 percent to 42.3 percent of total capacity,
equivalent to 34,559 gigawatt-hours generation. This compares to
49,572 gigawatt-hours or 60.7 percent of total capacity at the
same time last year.
Although precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast to
remain above average over the next five days, according to Weather
Services Corp. in the U.S., traders didn't anticipate increased
rainfall to compensate for limited snowmelt in Norway.
     Swedish dams gained 5.4 percent to 46.3 percent of total
capacity at the end of week 21, in line with expectations after
higher temperatures accelerated snowmelt.
     ""Prices are just building momentum to climb further and I
wouldn't feel comfortable selling now,'' an Oslo-based trader said
earlier today. He added producers were still in control of the
market and were likely to continue setting high system area
average prices.
     While day-ahead structures were discussed at 210.00-213.00
kroner a megawatt-hour in early trade, Thursday's spot price
averaged an unexpectedly high 218.15 kroner a megawatt-hour, up
6.43 kroner from today's price.
     Week 23 closed down 0.75 kroner at 203.50 kroner a megawatt-
hour.
     Norpool's trade volumes climbed to 2,022 gigawatt-hours
generation today from 1,052 gigawatt-hours yesterday.

"Scott Neal East desk meeting","Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 

List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 

In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 

Tks - Bob

Scott:
Thank you for  your interest in Tejas Smokers.  You have indicated an interest in a model  2436 steak/fajita grill and vinyl cover.  You show a Memorial area  address.   Might I suggest that you visit the Jerald Bettes Company on  6105 West 34th Street.  His phone number is 713 682 7901.  The store  is located between the old Hempstead Highway and US 290 (actually closer to the  Hempstead Highway).  Jerald is a knowledgeable pit master and has this  model in stock.
Sincerely yours,
Jim Bannerman

Western Spot Power Prices Rise With Weekend Risk Premium

     Los Angeles, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Western day-ahead
power prices traded higher because of risk premiums, traders
said.
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
increased an average of $18.13 a megawatt-hour to $168.13 amid
trades at $160.00-$175.00. Light-load energy sold at $100.00-
$110.00, an average of $30.56 more than equivalent trades made
yesterday for delivery today.
     Traders said that power prices typically rise on Friday
because Monday begins a new week and demand for energy increases.
     ""Prices also increase because there is some uncertainty of
what could happen over the next three days, a unit might trip or
the weather could suddenly change,'' said one Northwest trader.
      In the Southwest, power prices climbed an average of $12.45
at the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $1187.41
amid trades in the $175.00-$215.00 range.
     Temperatures in Phoenix were forecast to reach 105 degrees
on Sunday and increasing two degrees to 107 degrees on Monday.
     Traders said this should keep power prices elevated at Palo
Verde and at the Four Corners trading point in New Mexico.
     Four Corners heavy load energy traded at a Bloomberg average
of $178.33, gaining $4.04 more than yesterday.
     According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives
Inc., forecast temperatures in the Pacific Northwest would
average 4.0 degrees above normal over the next 6-10 days and 2.9
degrees above normal in the Southwest.

Northeast Spot Power Prices Rise With Natural Gas, Weekend Risk

     Philadelphia, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Following a two-
week decline driven primarily by mild temperatures and healthy
generation levels, day-ahead power prices in the Northeast U.S.
rebounded this morning amid rising fuel costs and weekend risk
premiums.
     Traders said natural gas futures on the New York Mercantile
Exchange were ""hardly bullish, but enough to spark a slight turn-
around"" in the power market.
As of 1 p.m. local time, the Henry Hub front-month contract
traded as high as $4.000 per million British thermal units, which
is 8.6 cents greater than yesterday's close, yet 94.9 cents below
the contract's three-month historical average.
     ""At this time of year, when generation is plentiful and
weather is a non-issue, power prices will jump on the most
insignificant of news,"" said one Northeast trader. ""These
[natural] gas prices don't pose any threat, they just lend some
fundamental justification for a run-up.""
     Peak power scheduled for Monday delivery to the Western Hub
of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection was
assessed $1.88 higher, at a Bloomberg volume-weighted index of
$25.51 per megawatt hour. While up on the day, next-day values
remain $18.75, or 42.4 percent, below the three-month historical
mean.
     In the New York Power Pools, next-day power prices climbed as
a function of weekend risk premiums. Traders said generators
typically place higher bids for Monday power because of the
uncertainties associated with speculating weather and load
forecasts 3 days in advance.
     Zone J was discussed at $53.00, though no trades were
reported. Zones A and G jumped $3.00 and $3.50, respectively, to
$35.00 and $47.25 indices.

Southern Demand, Forwards Drive Midwest Spot Power Prices Up

     Cincinnati, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Prices rose today
for peak power delivered Monday in the Mid-Continent U.S. in line
with short-term over-the-counter values and demand from the
South, traders said.
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday into
the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system climbed
$1.04 to $19.64 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $22.00
when the market opened to $17.00 after options expired.
     ""When the bal(ance of)-week market came out at $23-$24,
people tried to hold the dailies up at that level,"" an ECAR
trader said. ""There just weren't any fundamentals there to
support the market though, so it crashed.""
     In its seven-day forecast, Belton, Missouri-based Weather
Derivatives Inc. predicted high temperatures would average 7
degrees Fahrenheit below normal in Cincinnati.
     Traders said they expected cool weather to keep prices in
the low-$20 range through next week, while uncertain weather
forecasts limited price movement and activity in over-the-counter
contracts.
     ""Weather forecasters are having trouble predicting things
three days out, let alone 30. Nobody wants to take any serious
positions because of it,"" one trader said.
     In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, for-Monday
power at the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub sold $2.61
higher on average at $19.00-$23.00 as exports to the west
increased, traders said.
     Power in the lower half of the region sold 87 cents higher
at $18.00-$23.00, also boosted by exports.
     In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, traders said prices in
northern areas were little changed with stable temperatures,
rising 13 cents on average to $17.50-$23.00, while southern MAPP
spot prices climbed $2.41 to $19.00-$24.00 with demand from the
Southwest Power Pool.
     Peak Monday power in SPP sold at $18.00-$28.00, up $1.63 on
average from yesterday.
     ""A little bit of stuff going south is all that propped
things up today,"" a MAPP trader said. ""With things this cool
though, we're not going to see much of a market anytime soon.
Heck, I had to use the heater in my car this morning.""

Most Southeast Power Prices Rise Amid Weekend Risk, Weather

     Atlanta, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) - U.S. Southeast spot
electricity prices for delivery Monday were mostly higher today
because sellers expected a premium price to sell power three
days in advance, traders said.
     Peak power for Monday delivery into the Tennessee Valley
Authority transmission grid traded at $21.50-$28.00 a megawatt
hour, with a Bloomberg index rising $2.95 from yesterday to
$23.70.
     ""Prices are rising because it's a typical Monday, prices
usually fall on the weekend because of businesses and schools
closed, and then trade higher for Monday with everything re-
opening,'' said one Southeast marketer.
     In the Nashville, Tennessee area, temperatures that were
to reach 73 degrees Fahrenheit today, were expected to rise to
82 degrees for Monday.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price gained 56
cents from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of $28.63 amid trades
at $21.50-$39.50.
     Traders said that Entergy was purchasing power from the
Southwest Power Pool and paying premium prices because of
transmission constraints along with zero availability
transmission capacity.
     In the Southern section of the Southwest Power Pool,
trades for Southern SPP increased $3.50 to a Bloomberg index of
$27.00, with sales completed at Entergy between $26.00-$28.00.
     Forecasters call for temperatures in the Southeast to
average about 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit below normal over the next
seven days.
     On the New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. grid, peak power
for Monday traded between $27.00-$28.50, and averaged $28.00,
$1.21 higher than yesterday.
     ""Power prices next week will depend on what the weather
related demand is,'' said one Southeast marketer.
     In the Virginia-Carolina region, peak power increased
$5.00 to a Bloomberg index of $27.50, with trades completed
between $26.50-$28.50.

U.K. Short-Term Power Prices Fall on Increased Selling

     London, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. power prices
tumbled in lackluster trade today as participants sold contracts
deemed over-valued, traders said.
     July baseload traded 20 pence lower following trades at 17.55
pounds a megawatt-hour. August baseload traded at 17.60 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 25 pence lower than yesterday.
     ""If you've got day-ahead trading at 17 pounds in May, then
people are thinking July and August are definitely over-priced,""
one trader said.
     Participants, unsure of new price levels following the New
Electricity Trading Arrangements sold the summer month contracts
today as they compared them to lower day-ahead and week-ahead
prices, traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload for Monday last traded at 17 pounds a
megawatt-hour, 1 pound lower than yesterday.
     The contract fell on expectations temperatures, expected to
fall over the weekend, would begin to rise again on Monday,
stifling heating demand, traders said.
     Week 23 traded 70 pence lower than yesterday following trades
at 17 pounds a megawatt-hour.
     Traders said the Sizewell B power plant restart delay had
little impact on prices amid sufficient supply.

Nordic Power Prices Gain Ahead of Holiday in Limited Trade

     Lysaker, Norway, June 1 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, rose today
as participants purchased power in order to cover their contracted
requirements ahead of the long-weekend Whit holiday on Monday,
traders said.
     Week 23 closed at 206.18 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-hour,
gaining 2.18 after 297 megawatts traded. Week 24 jumped 3.5 kroner
to 210.50 kroner a megawatt-hour with 202 megawatts exchanged.
     Prices rose as participants bought contracts in an attempt to
close positions and minimize the risk of changing weather
conditions over the long-weekend, traders said.
     Scandinavian rainfall was forecast to remain above average
over the next 5 days, according to Weather Services Corp. in the
U.S. Still, worries about limited hydro-supply persist following
scarce snow accumulation and melting this year, traders said.
     Saturday's system area average price was set at 188.71 kroner
a megawatt-hour, 17.89 kroner lower than today's spot price,
because of lower industrial demand over the weekend. Traders said
the price was in line with expectations.
     Winter-2, 2001 rose 0.65 kroner to 220.25 kroner a megawatt-
hour after 89.00 megawatts were sold. Winter-1, 2002 jumped 1.25
kroner to 222.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Traded volumes on Nordpool rose to 1,292 gigawatt-hours
generation today from 1,030 gigawatt-hours yesterday.
     Still, activity was lackluster, traders said as many
participants were away from their trading desks ahead of Monday's
holiday.
     The Nordpool Exchange will be closed on Monday June 4 and is
scheduled to reopen on Tuesday.

Hi Lenny,

Don't know if you are involved in this area or not. I think maybe. Anyway, we have a refined lead contract with Hammond. The local buyer for Pottstown, PA is interested in getting information about natural gas for possible future use from ENRON. If you could contact him or direct him to the person that is in a position to help it would be appreciated.  His name is, Joe Stewartz E-MAIL address is jstewartz@hmndgroup.com

Thanking you in advance and hope all is well with you.

"Sunday Weather Update 06/03","Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an ""official"" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the ""Sunday Update"" link (near the bottom).  Login is ""enron"", Password is ""enron"".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.

Pacific Northwest Power Prices Slip Amid Increased Generation

     Portland, Oregon, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Pacific
Northwest day-ahead power prices slipped today amid increased
hydroelectric generation from the Grand Coulee generating
stations, traders said.
     Traders said the 24 hydroelectric generating stations
produced 42,546 megawatt-hours of generation yesterday, the
highest one-day generation since early March.
     ""Generation out of Grand Coulee is the highest I've seen in
quite some time,"" said one northwest day-ahead power trader. ""In
addition to the generation there, the folks below them have to
generate more at there ""run of river"" plants because there's more
water flowing downstream.""
     The Bloomberg Mid-Columbia day-ahead heavy load index price
fell an average of $28.90 a megawatt-hour to $150.00 amid trades
at $149.00-$155.00. Light load energy sold at $75.00-$79.00, an
average of $5.67 less than equivalent trades made yesterday for
delivery today.
     Reservoir data from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers shows
that at 1,271.6 feet of water, water levels at Grand Coulee are
about 98.6 percent of capacity.
     Traders said continued mountain run-off into the reservoir
is causing dam operators to generate electricity to prevent
spilling water over the dam.
     In California, traders said that the California Independent
System Operator issued at Stage II Emergency today, after
available generation dropped below 5 percent of reserves.
     Traders said the emergency was short-lived as the second day
of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-ordered load mitigation
proceedures caused demand to fall.
     The new procedures, which went into effect yesterday, impose
price limits on ISO power trades. The limits are set to the price
of the least efficient power-generating unit operating at the
time of the emergency.
     ""We saw prices rising to the $150.00-$200.00 level today,
though as soon as the FERC mitigation plan went into effect, the
prices dropped toward the $140.00 level,"" one western trader
said.
     In the Southwest, power prices climbed an average of $10.37
at the Palo Verde switchyard to a Bloomberg average of $174.96
amid trades in the $150.00-$200.00 range.
     Traders said temperatures were forecast in the low-to-mid
100s Fahrenheit through the weekend, which should keep power
prices elevated at Palo Verde and at the Four Corners trading
point in New Mexico.
     Four Corners heavy load energy traded at a Bloomberg average
of $174.29, $9.29 more than yesterday.

PJM Spot Power Prices Continue to Fall With Excess Generation

     Philadelphia, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Values for peak
power delivered tomorrow into the Western Hub of the Pennsylvania-
New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection fell again today as healthy
generation levels continued to depress real-time prices, traders
said.
     The Interconnection issued a Minimum Generation Alert for
Thursday's midnight period, when generation levels fell below the
1,000-megawatt threshold of normal minimum energy limits.
PJM operating instructions dictate that in situations of
excess capacity, energy deliveries into the control area are
minimized and where possible, energy sales to external control
areas are arranged.
""There's so much generation out there, you can't even give
this stuff away,"" said one PJM hourly trader. ""I had a marketer
call in and offer up 400 megawatts for free, and I couldn't even
take it. Where am I going to put it? Everyone's loads are right
where they should be.""
     For-Friday power was assessed 41 cents lower at a Bloomberg
volume-wieghted index of $23.64 per megawatt hour, representing a
67.9 percent year-on-year change from the May 31, 2000 index of
$73.67.
     Next-week values also continued to erode as a function of
excess supply and paltry demand. Since Tuesday, packages for June
4-June 8 have fallen $28.25, or 49.3 percent, to $29.00. Revised
weather forecasts are predicting temperatures for that period will
average 6.1 degrees Fahrenheit below normal, compared to initial
expectations for a 2-degree departure from normal.
     ""We're all waiting for that one piece of information to turn
this thing around and it's going to have to be weather, because
there's just no fundamentals to drive it right now,"" said one PJM-
based trader.
     In the New England Power Pool, day-ahead prices rose slightly
on expectations for possible heating loads. According to Weather
Services Corp. of Lexington, Massachusetts, temperatures will
average as low as 51 degrees in parts of New England tomorrow.
""These low temperatures have kept cooling demand pretty much
at zero this week, but now it looks as if they may actually
generate some heating demand tomorrow, and possibly into next
week.""
     Day-ahead prices continued to decline across all three zones
of New York, with Zone J down $1.75 at a Bloomberg index of
$47.00, and Zones G and A down $2.50 and $4.25, respectively, to
$43.75 and $32.00 indices.

Mid-Continent Power Prices Mixed With Cool Weather, New
Month

     Cincinnati, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-
Continent day-ahead peak power prices were mixed today as
traders closed long-term positions in hub markets while
cool weather continued to suppress demand in the Plains.
     Traders in the East Central Area Reliability Council
and Mid-America Interconnected Network markets said the
advent of the new spot month (June) caused prices to rise
as marketers bought and sold power to close June positions
taken earlier this month.
     ""The actual trading in the dailies was light; it was
mostly people closing positions,"" one trader said. ""You had
people buying to cover short positions for June and then
other people selling off long positions to cut their losses
for next week.""
     The Bloomberg index price for power delivered Friday
into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system
in ECAR rose 98 cents to $18.59 a megawatt-hour, with
trades ranging from $18.00-$19.50.
     ""We're going into a new month, and nobody's sure where
things should be right now. No one expected to see anything
like this at this time of year, so it's a little up in the
air,"" a MAIN trader commented.
     For-Friday parcels at the Chicago-based Commonwealth
Edison Corp. hub in MAIN sold $1.87 higher on average at
$16.50-$19.25 and power in the lower half of the region 18
cents higher at $17.00-$23.00.
     Short-term, over-the-counter, prices in ECAR and MAIN
continued to decline this week as below-normal temperatures
were forecast into next week and natural gas futures
remained under $4.00 per million British thermal units,
traders said.
     Power for delivery from June 4-8 was offered at $24.00
at both Cinergy and ComEd, a decline of over $35.00 from
Tuesday.
     In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool, atypically low
weather-related demand continued to pull peak spot power
prices down, traders said.
     Next-day power sold $1.17 less on average at $20.00-
$22.00 in northern MAPP and $2.31 less at $19.00-$21.00 in
the southern half of the region.
     Traders said demand was low enough that sales were
made just above utilities' generating costs to keep from
overloading local power grids with excess energy.
     They said if demand continues at current low levels,
utilities could be forced to reduce output at less
efficient units to avoid this problem.

Southeast Power Prices Decline Amid Less Demand, Mild Weather

     Atlanta, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) - Most U.S. Southeast
spot electricity prices for power delivered Friday declined
today because mild weather limited demand for electric power,
traders said.
     The Bloomberg Southeast regional average price declined
$1.69 a megawatt-hour from yesterday to a Bloomberg index of
$27.33 amid trades in the $20.00-$56.00 range.
      Traders said demand typically begins declining on
Friday's as more people take three-day weekends, reducing
loads.
     ""With less weather-related demand and the Friday factor
prices are falling a bit,'' said one Southeast marketer.
     In the Virginia-Carolina region, peak power declined 63
cents to a Bloomberg index of $22.50, with trades completed
between $20.00-$25.00.
     According to Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather
Services Corp., daily high temperatures in Richmond, Virginia,
were expected to reach 75 degrees Fahrenheit today and 73
degrees tomorrow.
     ""There is minimal activity in the market because of the
(mild) weather. With temperatures the way they are there is no
reason for prices to increase,'' said one Southeast trader.
     In the Northern section of the Southwest Power Pool,
trades for Northern SPP declined $4.00 to a Bloomberg index of
$19.50, with sales completed at  $18.00-$22.00.Forecasters call
for temperatures in the Southeast to average about 3.1 degrees
Fahrenheit below normal over the next seven days.

U.K. Power Rises on Higher Expected Demand in Scant Trade

     London, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.K. power prices
climbed today amid expectations of higher heating requirements,
traders said.
     Day-ahead baseload started trade at 17 pounds a megawatt-hour
before being last bid at 18 pounds a megawatt-hour, 1 pound higher
than yesterday.
     Across the U.K., temperatures were forecast to average
between 8-14 degrees Celsius today, falling to 5-13 degrees
Celsius tomorrow, according to the Weather Services Corp. U.S.
     Week 23 traded as low as 17.49 pounds a megawatt-hour today
before rising to trade at 17.89 pounds a megawatt-hour, 15 pence
higher than yesterday on the back of by climbing spot values,
traders said.
     ""After the system demand for tomorrow came out much higher
than today's, people started buying up day-ahead and interest
spilled over onto the week 23 contract,"" one trader said.
     Winter 2001 peak structures also rose today on continued
buying interest amid a combination of participants purchasing the
contract, deeming it undervalued, and in an attempt to influence
prices, traders said.
     ""People, mainly generators, would rather sell the contract at
higher levels so they are buying it up now,"" one trader said.
     Still, another trader disagreed, saying, ""too much volume is
going through at the moment for just a few players to try and move
the market. People are just finding the contract cheap, no one
knows what winter will bring under NETA.""
     Since the launch of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements
last March, traders have been trading actively in an effort to
find new price levels.
     Activity was unusually quiet today, traders said as an
industry function in the afternoon kept several participants away
from their trading desks.

Nordic Electricity Prices Remain Steady; Spot Value Falls

     Lysaker, Norway, May 31 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity
prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed
steady today because unseasonably low dam levels allowed hydro-
producers to store molten snow without increasing output, traders
said.
     Week 23 closed up 0.5 Norwegian kroner at 204.0 kroner a
megawatt-hour with 82.0 megawatts traded. Week 24 closed unchanged
at 207.0 kroner a megawatt-hour after 126.0 megawatts were
exchanged.
     ""Since prices haven't fallen with the inflow of melting snow
and low consumption because of higher temperatures, it's very
unlikely that they will later this year with increased demand and
reduced hydro-supply,'' an Oslo-based trader said.
     Friday's system area average price fell 5.00-10.00 kroner
more than expected to 206.60 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traders said
the drop came after producers made a correction from today's high
spot price of 218.15 kroner a megawatt-hour.
     Reduced demand by industrial end-users ahead of the weekend
also contributed to the lower spot value.
     Sweden was reportedly importing power from Finland, a trader
said earlier today. He added Swedish producers were in ""full
control'' of output following minimal flooding compared to last
year when generators preferred to sell electricity at lower prices
than to let reservoirs overflow with no economic gain.
     Winter-2, 2001 was little changed at 219.6 kroner a megawatt-
hour with 40.0 megawatts traded.
     Across Scandinavia, above-average rainfall was forecast over
the next 5 days, according to Weather Services Corp. in the U.S.
     Traded volumes on Nordpool dropped to 1,030 gigawatt-hours
generation today from 2,022 gigawatt-hours yesterday.

Re:  Gas Quality Specifications - REMINDER
Notice ID: 2435
5 - NO RESPONSE REQUIRED                          

REMINDER - The notice posted below is still in effect at least until the end of 
February 2002.

                 COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY
                  NOTICE TO ALL INTERESTED PARTIES
                        JANUARY 19, 2001


SUBJECT:  NOTICE TO PARTIES DELIVERING OR CAUSING GAS TO BE DELIVERED TO        
   COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION COMPANY

Pursuant to Section 25.2(a) of Columbia's tariff, Columbia is providing notice 
of the imposition of the following additional gas quality specification on all 
shippers, interconnecting pipelines, producers, and receipt meter operators, 
and all other parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into Columbia's 
system:

     All gas tendered under Columbia's tariff shall have a gross heating value  
    of no more than 1050 Btu per cubic foot.

This additional gas quality specification will be imposed two (2) business days 
after this notice is posted on Columbia's internet electronic bulletin board.  


In addition to complying with this additional gas quality specification, all 
parties delivering or causing gas to be delivered into the Columbia-operated 
Blue Water system on the Western Shoreline, the Southwestern Extension, or on 
the Header (west of the system null point) may be required to provide evidence 
to Columbia that such gas is being processed at the Blue Water Processing Plant 
to ensure that the composite gas stream at Egan, Louisiana has a gross heating 
value of 1050 Btu or less.  Evidence of the gas processing agreements may be 
required upon Columbia's request.  

Failure of a party to comply with the additional gas quality specification set 
forth above and to provide Columbia Gulf with evidence, upon request, of a gas 
processing agreement for gas delivered to the Blue Water system will result in 
Columbia Gulf refusing to accept gas from such party and to make corresponding 
redeliveries.

Imposition of this additional gas quality specification does not relieve any 
party delivering gas or causing gas to be delivered to Columbia's system from 
its existing obligations to comply with the gas quality specifications set 
forth in Section 25.1 of Columbia's tariff, to ensure the merchantability of 
the gas, and to ensure that gas has been properly processed before entering 
Columbia's system.

Columbia, pursuant to the terms of Section 25.2(a) of its tariff, is imposing 
this additional gas quality specification as it has determined, in its 
reasonable judgment, that harm to its pipeline system and its operations may 
occur if it receives gas on its system that fails to meet this additional gas 
quality specification.  Columbia reserves the right to revise this additional 
gas quality specification upon further analysis of the gas that is being 
received by Columbia and reevaluation of the potential harm to Columbia's 
pipeline system and its operations. 

You are further placed on notice that Columbia will hold you responsible and 
seek legal redress for any damages it incurs as a result of the higher Btu 
gas.

Any questions about this notice may be directed to Gary Espey, (713) 267-4761, 
or to John Pillion, (713) 267-4764.

Hey  guys. Even though Bubba is worthless he does have a good idea. It would be  nice to hear from some of the brothers.  Mike M. thanks for getting the  word out.
 
FYI  - I had my 40th the other day and Todd O., Bubba T., Hap W.and Bruce H. came  to the party. I have been married 8 years and have a 3 year old named  Harrison. I have been running an asset management company for about five years  and also oversee the Albert and Margaret Alkek Foundation in  Houston.
 
PS -  Bruce you are right he does look like John Candy..

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?

*********************************
Real Money Seasonal Trading Account (New! All weightings are approximate)
80% Money Market
5% HGMCY (Harmony Gold).
30% Rydex Tempest Fund.
We are more than a little bit short and happy. The trend had broken and the market could easily fall out of bed. Still, we'd expect a little bounce. If the market is down hard, we may send out a memo to chose the above position. We were right about not dumping Harmony Gold. We only wish we'd bought our other favorite DROOY as well. These stocks are looking a bit toppy, so we may take a profit on strength tomorrow.
Our managed tracking account is up 16.98% for the 18 months since June 30, 2000. This is a very conservative approach (~1/3 the risk of the market), using both long and short funds as well as the occasional favored sector/stock idea. All performance is net of fees, commissions, and interest. Your results may vary, and standard disclaimers may apply. We DO use discretion. For further information, call us now.

The market is driving us nuts, but the trend has turned. We have committed, perhaps foolishly, to holding this one. Cover all positions if we print 1065.

The MACD is negative, and the Weekly MACD is negative. The Seasonal Cycle is positive, but now less so. We are Bears.

Sold 1/2 position in Profunds Ultra Bull from 1/16 a/o 1/31.
**********************************
Last time, I said that I had to look for a bounce, but I noted that since things really didn't get THAT overdone on the downside, I'd view the rally as a shorting opportunity. I suppose the rally yesterday, and failure fits that description, but it wasn't what I was envisioning. Clearly the market was a bit overdone on the downside, but it wasn't REALLY overdone. Yesterday's action, actually, didn't really help the market's prospects. Certainly, a rally can materialize, but i don't have absolutely compelling reason to expect it to occur or that it will be much to write home about, as yet.
I am a bit surprised that the ARMS Ratio (aka the TRIN--a volume and breadth measure) close above 2.83 didn't trigger a rally yesterday, and the fact that it didn't may be an indicator of just how weak the current market is. I can't really get a bead on it, however. Chances are, the other oversold indicators need to give solid buys before the bounce materializes. That suggests to me that the market will take out the recent lows in one big rush, and then experience a healthy, high volume reversal. Thereafter, we would expect a 1-5 day rally.
The ongoing crisis in confidence in corporate governance may be having a much deeper effect than many realize. The average investor hasn't been having much fun for the past two years, and now he finds out that he's getting even less for his money when he buys stocks (e.g. Tyco and Enron). It's quite possible that Joe Six-Pack may decide that there are other, better, uses for his money than leaving it in the stock market. With mutual fund cash levels as low as they are, this could put a real cap on the market.
 
We have to love our shorts, at this juncture.

"NETCO","The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

"Trading Track - New participants (rotations assgined)"," 


All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks,


Karen B.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.
