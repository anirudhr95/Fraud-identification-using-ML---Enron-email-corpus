"TMS Shipper Scheduled Quantities Report","
I just ran several Shipper Scheduled Quanties reports and discovered the fomat had changed.  

I monitor several contracts for forecasting purposes and also provide Market Services invoicing 
information for revenues for negotiated rates and sharing revenues for volumes flowing West for USGT. 
I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need.  Before the change, 
I was able to run 1 report for each of these shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new 
report does not give me month-to-date totals I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, 
a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time consuming to run and analyze all these reports.  As 
Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.  Is there some way you could revise the report to again show the month-to-date totals?

Minor comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.


I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.

Thanks!

"OneOk Repath for contract 101559","Joe,

As discussed, please repath January 2001 for contract 101559.  I have input the rates on the invoice that Jeff Nielsen said he agreed to.  However, there are certain paths for the same period of time that Oneok indicated different rates for each.  They should be consistent so I input one rate for all paths on a Mid to Mid basis.  Therefore, after you repath the invoice, we will still have a difference.  I want to write-off whatever balance still exists after repathing.  Please prepare the write-off documentation and I will sign.  We need to be sure to do this before we go into next year.  Also, this is the only invoice you have provided me that had issues on this contract which I find hard to believe.   Can you double-check to see that there are no other A/R issues for this IT contract and let me know ASAP.

Thanks!

Subject:	OBA & Scheduling Alt FT by Price Tariff Filings

In an effort to get cash in the door for TW and to maximize revenue opportunity for TW in the coming year, I think we should look at getting two proposals on file with the FERC as soon as possible. 

One would be the OBA filing we have been discussing (and trying to support with historical data) to get automatic cash-out on OBA's in ""constrained"" areas on TW.

Second would be to look at filing for scheduling by price at alternate FT points.  This may be the time (the market to California is not so hot) to try to implement this.  I know we will have to look hard at the cost of the system modifications required and whether we can justify them.  

Glen is already scheduling a meeting next week for further discussion of the OBA tariff filing.  Could we discuss scheduling alternate FT by price at the same meeting?

"FW: Gas Tariff Issues at Winkler Co. Point - DRN 42599","Here is what I received from El Paso in reference to the Nitrogen issue at Keystone interconnect.

Subject:	Gas Tariff Issues at Winkler Co. Point - DRN 42599

For several days recently, gas received at the referenced receipt point has
exceeded the tariff levels for total diluents.  At the present time, the
Winkler Co. receipt point is shut-in because of excess Nitrogen.  Recently
we have been allowing this gas to be delivered at Waha (DRN 68517) instead
of the Winkler Co. (DRN 42599) point.  This is causing large imbalances at
each point which may or may not be able to be offset with each other.  We
would prefer that the gas be received as scheduled at each receipt point.

As stated in the EPNG Tariff under section 5.1.f under Gas Quality:

Diluents  -  The gas shall not at any time contain in excess of three
percent (3%) total diluents (the total combined carbon dioxide, nitrogen,
helium, oxygen, and any other diluent compound) by volume, except for gas
applicable to Sections 5.2 and 5.3.

Sections 5.2 and 5.3 cover receipt locations which have grand-fathered
contracts and arrangements.

While we try to work with our customers when there are slight variations of
the gas quality specifications during customer maintenance activities, it is
important that our customers understand that their gas must meet the
specifications set forth in the tariff.  To the extent that is not possible,
then our gas quality team must make a determination whether the gas must be
shut-in immediately, or whether a waiver can be granted, based on numerous
factors which would include the type of diluent out of spec, the cause and
duration of the problem, and the plan customers have to correct the problem.


It is important that Northern Natural comply with the provisions set in the
EPNG Tariff.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Sincerely,

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>

"GISB Update","Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.  Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.  Below is my update on a few GISB matters.  We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.

ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB)
The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.  The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).  The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.  In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.

GISB REPRESENTATON
Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.  Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.  Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.

ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.  The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.  This is probably a firm date.  The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.

GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA
Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.  The errors in the standards books are extensive.  The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.  I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.  Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.  Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.  I'll let you know what is decided.


Thanks,
Theresa

"Aberdeen and Welcome","Lynn/Karen:
 
The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.  
 
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.  And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.  
 
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.   Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.  They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.  And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.   But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.  That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
 
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.  But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.  And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.  
 
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.  If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.  But that is as far as we are planning to go.   We view the flow restriction to be on your side.  And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st. 
 
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.  Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.  But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.  
 
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.  Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

Subject:	RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.

Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

"RE: PNR Balance on PNM Cr# 25672 - PO# 27190","I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject:	short term/daily capacity update

I wanted to make sure everyone was aware of the changes that we have had so far to the available short-term sustainable/daily capacity approvals/postings.  The attached file shows the points that have been approved as potential points for short term sustainable and/or daily capacity.  We currently have 20,000 MMBtu/day posted as available short term sustainable capacity for the month of November for Ventura and Demarc as receipts.  We also have 3,600 MMBtu/day posted as available short term sustainable capacity for the month of November for East leg deliveries.  Daily we may/may not have available 5,000 East Leg delivery capacity and 20,000 Carlton delivery capacity.

Several of the points that have been approved for sale of short term capacity if it becomes available currently show no available firm capacity for the rest of November.  These points include:  TBPL/Beatrice, Pony Express, and Mullinville as receipts and Keystone as a delivery.  If gas control and planning determine we can support additional receipts/deliveries at these points, the available capacity postings could change.

If you have questions or would like to know where the postings are located on our website, let me know.  Also, please forward this on to other members of your team that I haven't included above.  Thanks.

"RE: Outbound TMS Messages","It is possible to filter ""our"" critical messages from our applications and allow them to be sent externally.  I will continue to work with the messaging team to put together guidelines to address our requirements and issues.   

I believe that each type of emergency will define some of our options.  For example in this weeks virus, messages from applications would not spread the virus.  This virus was spread if you clicked the link (X rated)--at that point everyone in your ""sent"" log would get the message, sometimes many messages.  We may have still blocked incoming messages on this emergency, but outgoing from applications wouldn't impacted others.  Pointing to Omaha in this case would not have worked.

I will keep everyone posted on the status as I move forward with the messaging team.

Subject:	Outbound TMS Messages

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called ""critical notices"" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.   

I do think we need to know the following:  

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?    
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?  

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Gary has been working behind the scenes with your group, the field, marketing and technology to resolve the problems associated with equipment not suited for providing adequate daily information.  At the same time he has been working on gaining assistance in getting 16 day measurement data into the office on time for processing and review prior to month's end close.   Just as a side note, I understand now that Charlie Thompson of the Measurement Technology Group and Tech Ops has been given the charge to come up with a five year plan for installing automated and adequate equipment accross the board for these situations.

Ellis/Gary

I hope that you can both make it to the meeting on Monday to discuss the issue of daily NNG measurement readings.  A number of our NNG customers are protesting DDVC invoices based on our inability to provide daily measurement information.   Alliant is just the latest in the string of customers.   The NNG marketing group is very frustrated on this issue.  

We need to put all our collective talents together.  This issue needs the highest levels of attention possible from measurement.

"FW: Results of Meeting on Storage Allocation Changes","Lynn,

Below is the memo I sent out September 20th summarizing the September 18th meeting. See second bullet item in my summary. I remember Sue couldn't attend that day, but Kent was very active in discussions throughout the meeting. 

I couldn't find the copy I sent. Fortunately, Gerry still had his copy.

Subject:	Results of Meeting on Storage Allocation Changes 

The following summarizes the results of our meeting......If you want to discuss further, please call me.

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point
The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes  to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. 
Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. 
 
Question:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?
 
Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity
The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. 

Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity
The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.

"RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points","This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:	Galena/Belleville Firm Volume Split

I have attached a Excel file that includes the Galena/Belleville firm contract volume split out and their respective per cents.  The first page of the sheet has the summary of the data and Galena/Belleville split out, with the second and third sheets indicating the firm contracted volumes in the two groups for the 2001 heating season.

Madison Gas, in their firm contract 21340, does have the ability to deliver to both Madison (POI 53782 - 47,830 MMBTUD) and ANR/NNG Janesville (POI 180 - 46,469 MMBTUD), however, the total at the two points should not exceed 47,830 MMBTUD.  Contractually this creates a ""double dip"" in the CAS groupings that we ""adjust"" out of the system.  

The total firm behind Galena is 348,719 MMBTUD and Belleville 258,666 MMBTUD, including the one Daily firm contract for November.  Without the daily firm contract the firm volume is 340,119 MMBTUD for Galena and 250,066 MMBTUD for Belleville.  Please note that with the CAS groupings any firm volumes in the Belleville group are also included in the Galena group.  The Wisconsin Gas contracts are split between the two groups with Galena at 50,490 MMBTUD and Belleville at 25,2444 MMBTUD.  If in the nomination process you include all the Wisconsin Gas Zone nomination in the Belleview group, rather than split the volumes between Galena and Belleville, the  total Belleville nominations could be as high as 275,310 MMBTUD.  Other shippers that have firm volumes split in the two groups include Madison, WEPCO, WP&L and WPS Energy.  The per cent spilt by shipper is indicated in red on the first page of the attached Excel file.

Call if you have any questions.

I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference
in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR
measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the
monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed
the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue
between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see
if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton
Report for the 26th.

"Common Sense for your Personal Home Computer","Attached is an article from Reuters. It illustrates the true vulnerability of our information if left unprotected, and demonstrates how one attack can cause a variety of different issues.
Please recognize possible exposures you face on your personal home computer. Ensure that you are taking precautions. The following are some common sense rules you can follow:
?	Use an anti-virus program such as Symantec's Norton Anti Virus (NAV) or McAfee's VirusScan and update virus data files regularly.
?    Use Windows Update regularly. Microsoft offers updates to its software that fix security issues on your computer's operating system.
?    Consider a firewall program such as Netice's Black Ice or Zone Lab's Zone Alarm. These offer protection from people doing online probing of your equipment while you're on the internet.
Remember, ""An ounce of protection is worth a pound of cure"".  Nothing can guarantee one hundred percent protection but this will get you headed in the right direction.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - An Internet worm that leaves infected computers vulnerable to future hacking by tracking what is typed on the keyboard, including passwords and credit card details, was spreading rapidly on Monday, computer security companies warned. 
The worm, called ``Badtrans,'' spreads through Microsoft Corp. Outlook or Outlook Express e-mail programs and automatically sends itself to unanswered e-mails in inboxes, according to several antivirus companies. 
The attachment, which contains the malicious program, can be executed simply by reading or previewing it and doesn't need to be double clicked or opened separately, experts said. 
The worm contains a keystroke logger, which can be used to record what people type to obtain passwords and credit card numbers, they said. 
``It does no damage to files but does drop a backdoor trojan on the machine which would allow a hacker to come back and access personal information,'' said April Goostree, virus research manager at McAfee. 
While corporate e-mail gateways are blocking the worm, many home and small office computer users who aren't up-to-date on their antivirus software are getting infected, she said. 
The subject line varies, often assuming the text of the unanswered e-mail whose e-mail address it co-opts. The name of the attachment varies as well, with suffixes including .doc,. pics, and. news. 
The worm, a variant of one discovered in April, has hit at least 50 countries, with most infections in Germany, followed by the UK and United States, said UK-based MessageLabs, which reported receiving 400 copies an hour this weekend.

If you ever have questions about whether a battered stock is cheap, check out its bonds. Bond analysts almost always know best because they're looking at the guts of a company -- the ability of a company to service its debt. If it can't service the debt, stockholders are at a greater risk of getting pummeled because debtholders always come before stockholders when it comes to getting paid. 
Which brings us to Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) . The only reason to mention it is that some analysts are really reiterating buys based on its low multiple. (Low, fellas, is relative to reality!) Cramer today talks about his hunch that the stock is vulnerable because, as he says, ""accounting irregularities = sell."" 
Good point. Now let's back that up with the bond market's view, which can be seen in the so-called ""swap spread,"" which is bond-traderspeak for the spread between the LIBOR interest rate and the interest rate for comparable paper, or swaps. It's a benchmark bond traders use to determine risk. Tuesday, that spread on Enron's five-year notes was 650 basis points, or about 6.5 percentage points. Today, it's 1,000 points, or 10 percentage points. As one bond trader told me today, anybody would be crazy to pay that much. Another bond trader told another friend the same thing. 
Why? As of June 30, Enron had cash of just $847 million and debt of nearly $13 billion. 
And this observation: Those five-year notes currently yield more than 11%. That's a junk-bond yield for what is still rated as an investment-grade debt; anything more than 9% is considered ultra-high risk. So while you can make 11%, that's still not enough ""where the accounting is questionable,"" one bond trader says. ""You're not being adequately compensated for the fact that the company could default. You have to worry about your recovery value."" 
Not the kind of risk/reward an investor wants to see when the company in question still has a market cap of about $12.5 billion with a capital B. 
Speaking of bonds and stocks: Even with its stock at about $1.16, Global Crossing (GX:NYSE - news - commentary) still has a market cap that exceeds $1 billion. But while its stock has rallied, its bank debt has stayed relatively flat at around 50 cents to 53 cents on the dollar. Similar stories can be told for XO Communications (XOXO:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of about $473 million and bank debt trading at around 52 cents on the dollar; Level 3 Communications (LVLT:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $1.2 billion and bank debt trading at 66 cents; and McLeodUSA (MCLD:Nasdaq - news - commentary) , with a market cap of $462 million and debt that trades at 53 cents. 
Where are opportunistic bond investors, who should be hopping on such cheap debt -- especially bank debt, which is at the top of the getting-paid-back food chain? They're nowhere to be seen, for the same reasons they're not jumping to buy Enron's bonds: Too much risk, because when companies like those go bad, their assets trade for less than the bonds are currently trading. (Try telling that to ""hope-springs-eternal"" stock investors!) 
Providian pratfalls: Turns out an item here back in May was more fortuitous than it appeared. The item noted how institutional bond investors, who often pony up a slight premium to LIBOR to buy so-called credit default-protection insurance, couldn't find any at any price for Providian (PVN:NYSE - news - commentary) . The insurance is sold by investment banks such as J.P. Morgan Chase and typically involves a complex hedge of stocks and options that requires an investor to take the other side of the trade. If nobody'll take the other side of the trade -- or will charge a ridiculously high price to do so -- investors should beware. Which brings us back to Enron: It is possible to buy credit insurance, but at more than a whopping 1,000 basis points over LIBOR. Hardly a vote of confidence. 


Waiting for the Other Shoe to Drop on Enron

Accounting irregularities = sell. Those three words and an equals sign have always served me well. They remain squarely posted on the base of my quote machine, always in view. They have never let me down. When I have deviated from them I have had to pay severely, as I did when I ignored the accounting irregularities in Cendant (CD:NYSE - news - commentary) initially or when, because of my four-month holding period, I couldn't sell Qwest (Q:NYSE - news - commentary) . 
Which is why I came in with guns blazing on this Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) , telling you to sell it. The stock has now lost half its value and all I can say is, I still can't see why you have to tempt fate and own this one. The notion that the businesses are fundamentally sound, that it has a great core business, is just hokum. Who the heck knows? Who has any idea of what this company can really earn? Who knows what it did earn? 
All I know is that soon the drumbeat will be on from the Democrats that the Justice Department is playing political favorites by not pursuing Enron (noted Republican-giving company) for alleged fraud. 
When that happens, when that shoe drops, wherever Enron is, then maybe it is worth some scrutiny. 
But I bet I still won't like it. 


Enron's Excuses Sound Familiar

If you disclose something that is wrong, and you get accountants to check off that wrong deed, and outside lawyers to check off on that wrong deed, is it therefore right? 
That's what Enron (ENE:NYSE - news - commentary) is asking us to believe. By telling us that its ridiculous dealings with the chief financial officer and his private partnership were all sanctioned by outside professionals, they have simply compounded the error. Next they will tell us that Janus, the largest shareholder, knew and wanted those partnerships to generate upside surprises! 
What they are doing at Enron is, well, positively -- here we go -- '80s! In the '80s, you had all of these savings-and-loan jokers pleading that the outside accountants and lawyers checked off on massive chicanery. Somehow it was supposed to make the chicanery kosher. 
Nope. 
What it ended up doing was getting the lawyers and accountants in trouble. The government ended up going after them, too, for abetting the travesties. 
Enron didn't use taxpayers' money, so it is arguably not as clear-cut. But the more we probe this Enron, the more we check it out, the more we know it really stinks and that Jeffrey Skilling didn't leave because the stock got hammered, or some other authentic Wall Street gibberish, but because of this nasty, unseemly situation. 
We don't want an SEC probe here. We want a Justice Department probe. This isn't about unclear disclosure. This could end up being about fraud. 
In the meantime, I wouldn't touch this stock with a 10-foot pole. This one's gonna get real nasty before it gets nice. If it ever does. 

FOOL ON THE HILL 
Enron's Disdain for Investors 
The Motley Fool.com
10/24/01
While recent coverage of Enron centers on the CFO's past partnerships, a smaller -- and more obvious -- omission is what should really make individual investors turn the heat up on this company. Not only does it not release its cash flow statement during each quarter's conference call and press release, something we don't like but is prevalent, it also doesn't release its balance sheet. The company must think we're idiots. They're wrong. 
By Tom Jacobs <<http://www.fool.com/About/staff/tomj.htm>> (TMF Tom9) 
October 24, 2001 
Enron's (NYSE: ENE) <<http://quote.fool.com/uberdata.asp?symbols=ENE>> troubles just don't stop. On Monday, the company announced <<http://www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases/2001/ene/70-LJMfinalltr.html>> that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had requested information on ""certain related party transactions <<http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp010802e.htm>>."" That was a veiled reference to partnerships until recently organized and directed by Enron CFO Andrew Fastow. There has been a flurry -- a hailstorm -- of financial media attention to this. There are only three possibilities, and none is palatable:
The company's board allowed this deal in order to -- using corporate speak -- ""incentivize"" the CFO, and it was not legal; 
It was legal, but unethical; or 
Enron has been less than forthcoming, perpetuating a pattern of disdain for investors and keeping them in the dark. 
The accounting machinations involve mind-numbing terms and obfuscation, making a simple explanation of what is being alleged above my capacity to provide. The New York Times' Floyd Norris calls them ""some of the most opaque transactions with insiders ever seen."" That leads me to one conclusion when I think about burying myself with the company's SEC filings, accounting texts, my high-speed Web connection, and some beer: that of Shakespeare's King Lear -- ""that way madness lies."" 
On the one hand, I know that pulling all this apart might teach me useful things about accounting, reading financial statements, and finding trouble. (To read what this is all about, check the ""Certain Transactions"" section of the company's latest proxy statement <<http://quote.fool.com/sec/sec.asp?date=03/27/2001&currTicker=ene&symbols=ene&guid=%7B5D0F1D1D%2D5DB7%2D4F4E%2D9BD9%2DFA154603F662%7D>>.) I fully intend to do that -- someday. For now, though, all I need to know about Enron as an investment is that the company has not made these issues transparent.
What's worse, though, is that Enron has made it a habit to keep investors in the dark, and not only about the potentially troublesome CFO issue. The company goes out of its way to hide its true financials. That really cheeses me off.
The quarterly call and press release parade
Most companies hold quarterly conference calls and simultaneously spew press releases (for which the companies pay good money to Business Wire and PR Newswire for dissemination) that allegedly state their latest quarter's numbers and talk about the business. Sometimes, when they have cleaned off their glasses enough for visibility and run it by their lawyers, execs will even venture to speak about the business climate ahead. At least thanks to Regulation Fair Disclosure <<http://www.fool.com/Specials/2001/sp010418.htm>> -- ""Reg. FD"" -- analysts don't get a secret call with the ""real"" numbers at another time than the public. We like that.
Perhaps in a world of pro forma numbers <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010815.htm>> and EBITDA <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>> -- both of which Phil Weiss has skewered appropriately in past columns -- the calls and press releases could never be expected to be that substantive. That makes individual investors increasingly correct to greet such information with cries of ""bullfeathers!"" It only takes a few reviews of earnings press releases to make anyone a skeptic. The PR department carefully dresses them with spin, leaving the details for the fine print. Headline: ""Earnings up!"" (Revenues down 40%.) Headline: ""Revenues up!"" (Earnings down 40%.) The skullduggery of spin and pro forma mangles earnings to meaninglessness <<http://www.fool.com/news/foth/2001/foth010504.htm>>.
At least the conference calls themselves allow you a sense of managers as people and potentially some information about the business, but the financials are not helpful. Why? 
Hiding the cash flow statement
Because almost every company gives up only part of the financial picture at call and press release time. If the income statement is increasingly unhelpful, at least the balance sheet tells you whether the company has increased or decreased cash, right? Well, not quite.
You really need the cash flow statement -- the best measure of how the company's business actually performs. Even then, you may need to make further adjustments <<http://aol.fool.com/portfolios/rulemaker/2001/rulemaker010906.htm>>. Yet the overwhelming majority of companies do not provide the cash flow statement at the call and press release time. 
Check the companies you own. If they don't release cash flow statements with their earnings -- or, at least, prior to SEC filings, you should write and otherwise hound investor relations to push management to do so. Encourage your fellow investors to do so too, and tell the company that The Motley Fool sent ya. They will maintain that the numbers aren't ready at earnings time. Tell them to wait until they are. The numbers are certainly ready in time for the SEC deadline, and wouldn't we be happy to wait a week or two for the complete picture? Or, hey, why not do two releases -- one when the earnings are ready and another for the cash flow? 
If not releasing the cash flow statement were Enron's only sin, it wouldn't be that big a deal. It has plenty of company. But this pre-Halloween < <http://www.fool.com/specials/2001/sp011024.htm>> scary tale gets worse. Unfortunately for Enron investors, the company does the hide-the-cash-flow-statement gig one better.
Hiding the balance sheet
For at least the last three quarters that I checked, Enron hides the balance sheet until SEC filing time. That's right: Not just the cash flow statement, but the balance sheet too. All they release is the income statement -- though, in truth, it does provide pages of income statement information for its many businesses. But why fail to release the balance sheet?
The only conclusion can be that management doesn't want to show its cash balances until it can slip them into SEC filings it thinks people won't bother to read. When questioners on a conference call earlier this year urged former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling to provide a balance sheet at earnings release, Skilling reportedly ""called the questioner a common vulgarity that surprised many listeners.""
Off his meds that day? Or a symptom of the company's attitude towards shareholders? Looks like the latter: Skilling's gone, but the practice hasn't changed. 
It's about management
We don't depend on management for the numbers during the quarterly public calls and releases. A publicly traded company's financials will appear a few weeks later through its SEC filings available through our Quotes & Data page <<http://quote.fool.com/>>. No investor should be buying -- or holding -- stock in companies if they don't read their filings carefully. It's hard enough to discern what's going on in a business without doing so, and even in those filings -- such as with options grants to management -- the real meat is buried in footnotes. Not reading 10-Qs and 10-Ks is like getting married without dating, or buying a car by paint color only.
What Enron's failure to release this information says is that its management and corporate governance are sub-par. It says management is willing to hold these events, but it'll be darned if it'll present anything meaningful or make it easy for individual investors to find out anything other than management's spin. In Enron's case, its former CEO heaped abuse on someone who dared ask for a change. Does that make Enron's earnings releases circuses? Draw your own conclusion.
Is management listening? Perhaps. It hastily pulled together a conference call yesterday. TMF community member emschulze took notes <<http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?mid=15974151>>:
""On call, analyst asks why no balance sheet with recent earnings release given company's previous claim that it will work to offer investors greater transparency in measuring its performance... response was that balance sheet doesn't normally come together until the week after its earnings release and that it will be included in 10-Q to be filed by Nov. 14... CEO indicates that it will do a better job of improving timing of release of earnings and balance sheet in future, implying that investors won't have to wait all the way until 10-Q filing deadlines to see balance sheet.""
That's a good sign. But until the company makes an unambiguous commitment to provide the balance sheet at earnings time, Enron should be in the doghouse. 
Good corporate governance means companies release all their quarterly financial statements and discuss them at the same time because today's income statements and pro forma numbers are borderline useless. If it means a delay or a second release to get the numbers together, what's the problem? Shareholders should demand no less. When a company trumpets an income statement, as Enron has, no one should be surprised when smoke appears. And perhaps much more.
Tom Jacobs (TMF Tom9) would like to improve his own cash flow statement. At press time, he owned no shares of Enron.

Bonds Of Troubled Enron Quoted In Dollars, Not Spreads
By Michael C. Barr

10/24/2001
Capital Markets Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
Of DOWJONES NEWSWIRES 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- The bonds of embattled Enron Corp. (ENE) are trading on a dollar basis and not on a yield margin or spread to Treasurys - another sign of increasing investor skittishness about the once high flying energy trader.
The bonds, which carry investment-grade ratings, ""started trading with a dollar price two days ago,"" said Gary Brown, managing director and head of corporate trading, Wachovia Securities, Charlotte, N.C. 
Bonds are being offered at dollar prices in the high 80's to low 90's, say traders. 
Investment grade bonds typically trade on a spread margin over comparable Treasury issues. ""Credit bonds,"" which have questions about their quality, are traded in dollar quotes, said one analyst. 
Moody's Investors Service rates the company's senior unsecured debt Baa1, but recently placed the debt on review for downgrade. Both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Fitch rate the debt triple-B-plus. 
But the company ""may be going into the double-B (non-investment grade) sector, "" said Harold Rivkin, principal of H. Rivkin & Co., a distressed debt brokerage firm, Princeton, N.J. 
""I am starting to get inquiry from investment grade holders about the market for Enron bonds,"" Rivkin said, noting that some high-grade portfolios can't have paper below investment-grade. 
Houston-based Enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, recently announced a large third-quarter loss and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission into a partnership arrangement that involves the company's chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow. 
Enron has approached Citicorp (C) about obtaining a possible $750 million loan, according to a source close to the bank. But the source indicated Tuesday that nothing has proceeded past the preliminary inquiry. 
The company's stock, while once a favorite of the investment community, has taken a pounding. It traded early this year at more than $80 a share. Late Wednesday, it was at $15.70 a share. 
And, in a reflection of current investor sentiment, for the second time this week analyst Carol Coale of Prudential Securities downgraded the company to a sell recommendation from a hold. Her concern is ""not because of the things we know but because of the things that we potentially don't know.""

USA: Group to put corporate directors under microscope.
By Kevin Drawbaugh

10/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - Directors of corporations will be graded according to their performance by a service expected to be launched soon by business research group The Corporate Library, the group's cofounder said on Wednesday. 
In a move that could cause some sweaty palms in boardrooms across the country, long-time shareholder activist Nell Minow said directors will be awarded grades of A, B, C and lower, based on meeting attendance and other benchmarks.
""It's always been my dream to rate individual directors like bonds. Directors have not had the scrutiny they deserve,"" said Minow, who said the service will be called Board Analyst. 
Planned as an added feature on an existing Web site, thecorporatelibrary.com, Board Analyst is still in testing stages but is expected to launch next year, she said. 
Only directors of U.S. companies will initially be evaluated. Non-U.S. directors may be added later. 
Minow and partner Robert Monks have written several books on corporate governance and shareholder rights. They formerly managed the Washington-based shareholder activist Lens Fund, which they sold last year to British fund management group Hermes. 
Their latest venture may find a receptive audience on the institutional buy-side, said industry spokespersons. 
""There's been growing interest within our membership in board membership, in general, and individual directors, in particular. I definitely think there would be interest in more information on individual directors,"" said Ann Yerger, spokeswoman for the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents America's large pension funds. 
The corporate governance movement since its beginnings in the 1970s has focused on making directors more accountable and responsible. Many companies have responded by requiring more outside directors and more meaningful stock ownership among directors. But examples of lax board oversight still abound. 
One example would be Enron Corp. , whose stock has plunged in recent days since the company said the Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating transactions involving certain outside partnerships and the company's chief financial officer, Minow said. 
""Where was the Enron board in all of this?"" she asked. ""Boards and outside consultants are supposed to vet ideas for partnerships like these. That apparently didn't happen here."" 
Taking the corporate governance argument a step further, Minow argued that effective board membership is more than a theoretical question. It should be an issue for investors to evaluate when they consider buying stock in a company. 
""This isn't just a corporate governance thing. This is part of investment analysis,"" she said. 
Institutional investors routinely examine corporate management when analyzing stocks. Whether they will begin to examine directors, as well, remained an open question. 
""Nell and Bob Monks have been shareholder activists for a long time and have moved corporate governance in a positive direction,"" said Peter Gleason, vice president of research and development at the National Association of Corporate Directors, which represents more than 3,000 corporate directors. 
Surveys by the association recently showed that corporate directors rank self-evaluation high on their list of concerns. ""More and more directors are saying this is something we should be doing,"" Gleason said.

Subject:	Lincoln Electric System - Delivery Point Operator

Lincoln Electric System (LES) would like us to set out in writing what a delivery point operator is.  LES is constructing and owning a new TBS (LES TBS #1) to their new power plant near Lincoln.  Apparently, having a letter setting this out is very important to them.  Dari has developed the attached letter and wanted to run it by you all for your approval.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have any issues with the letter.  Thanks!

Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I'll arrange for the conference room to be available.

Just wanted to make sure you are aware of these and confirm that they are companies you work with.  Karen sent a note to Robert Benningfield asking for a status report for everything showing under her, and she included these.  If I don't hear from Robert, I'll call him on Monday.

If they were to schedule their gas directly to Golden Spread POI- 71395, operations could put them on the suction side of Plains turbine if we got full. Also Golden Spread would have to agree to flow the gas on a 24 hour basis and not 16 hour day.

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Joe and Sherry

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to ""schedule"" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

"FW: Carlton Surcharge .0175","Just wanted to let everyone know about this change in the Carlton commodity surcharge - this will be effective 11/01/2001 and will take the place of the old $.04 charge that we used to see on deliveries to Mid 17 for the winter months.

In case you haven't heard, last week we received FERC approval to change the Carlton commodity surcharge from $.0062 to .0175.
I have sent the updates to IT to load into TRS for this winter and for the next 3 years (through 3/2005).  The surcharge may change before 2005, but I thought it would be better to have our most recent approved rate than to leave it at either zero or $.04.

Please pass this information along to anyone in your area that needs to know.

Thanks.

Bill talked with RER regarding this issue last week and committed to get a letter to them articulating our position with supporting provisions of the tariff.  Based on that conversation, the scheduled meeting was cancelled.  Moreover, he is reviewing RER's original dispute letter from March and we can determine course of action thereafter.

Dari - Did you receive my e-mail of late which had a few questions regarding Section 8 of the tariff?

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

        2.  Is their an amount limit per team? 
        3.  Is their an amount limit per individual?

"RE: TW/ENA compressor deal","Lynn, I spoke to Dan Fancler this morning and he said to leave the NNG Nom. alone for now. James Centilli is working on a solution for TW and will let us know how to proceed. Jean Adams, myself as well as other team members continue to monitor the ENA nominations on NNG.

Subject:	RE: TW/ENA compressor deal

Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the Ele compressors.  

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them.  

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli keep us informed of what the new deal will look like.

I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for the  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to be the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns on this matter please let me know. Thank you. 

One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for all the individuals involved in this testing.

Bill talked with RER regarding this issue last week and committed to get a letter to them articulating our position with supporting provisions of the tariff.  Based on that conversation, the scheduled meeting was cancelled.  Moreover, he is reviewing RER's original dispute letter from March and we can determine course of action thereafter.

Dari - Did you receive my e-mail of late which had a few questions regarding Section 8 of the tariff?

"Clarification of IES Industries","Lynn,

Koch is the agent for IES nominations.

On the accounting side, IES pays their own invoices.  WP&L, Interstate Power, IEA and IES are all under Alliant, but they operate independently.

Kathy Washington currently handles the scheduling for IES since she handles Koch, and also IES accounting since they pay their own invoices.  However, each month Kathy Washington gives the IES invoices to Jean to include with Alliant's mailout.

Hope this explains everything!

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject: Receipt Points


Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips

	I talked with Mary Darveaux and there are some possible billing changes  coming that
	we need to discuss in the morning.

	1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing
	2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator
		calculation. (as well as fuel)
	3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts.

	Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that
	doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn

"RE: Requested training by Xcel in Denver","Lynn, the training went well.  We covered the following topics:

	- 8 a.m. true up process and how to avoid mistakes or invalid codes
	- Winter Power Pak agreement and true up process
	- Information about realigning their Demarc and Beatrice volumes
	- Differences between Demarc and Mid 17 Pool
	- Addressed EDI issues (will discuss with Mary Draemer to resolve)
	- Identifying cuts and utilizing the ""Detect"" tool in TMS
	- Also discussed Powertex and Pinnacle power plants since Xcel operates SPS
	- Discussed how and when path rankings come into play and how to avoid 
	  cutting their long term deals versus their daily gas

These were just a few of the topics I can think of off the top of my head, but overall I think the meeting was a success from an NNG and Xcel standpoint.  Let me know if you need anymore information.  Thanks.

Hello,

Xcel has requested that we provide an afternoon of training at their offices in Denver (similar to last year).  The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

Tim Johanson

Frank, 

Accounting has indicated our October invoice has some DDVC and IT overrun charges that our metering does not show.  Before we can pay these, we would need you to verify the measurement of all of our stations.  Bill and his SCADA folks believe the untelemetered allocations are inaccurate, and likely causing the DDVC and overrun.  

I have asked our Accounting group to short pay the October DDVC's of $26,374; and to also short pay the associated transport invoice for the IT overrun of $29,704.52; a total disputed cost of $56.078.52.  

Let me know if you need any additional information, a brief recap of the disputed charges are shown below, 

Thanks, 

Tom

"Scheduling Alt FT by Price","Per our discussions yesterday, I did find an Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P. Order On Rehearing in my file, dated August 5, 1997 in Docket No. RP97-126-002 (80 FERC P61,199) concerning scheduling alt FT by price.  On reviewing it again, some key points were:  

	Allocate based on the highest percentage of the maximum rate - the rate used being the rate for the package of services that includes those secondary rights.
	The Commission maintains that all firm capacity, once scheduled, be curtailed pro rata, without regard to price.

Panhandle also filed on March 14, 1997 for scheduling alt FT by price at Docket No. RP97-291 (it's referenced in footnotes, but I don't have a copy of the filing).

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

"New Years Day","NNG had EDI problems this morning,  Evidently TMS ran out of disc space causing all of the files to get hung up in the HUB for the Final cycle and the ID1 cycle. The help desk was paged at 7:35 a.m. to report the problem , Toby responded, but was having trouble reaching the on call TMS. We did not get a response until 8:55 a.m. from TMS , the EDI files were in the HUB for over two hours. Mary Draemer was very helpful and made follow up calls so we could relay an estimated time frame to our customers when this problem would be resolved. Monday 12/31/2001 we also experienced printer problems , we were told that a print server was down, the Solution Center was redirecting print servers on an individual basis at our work stations. Kathy Washington could not print this morning and had tried to contact someone at the Solution Center, and did not receive a response back for quite a while, we went through the Help desk (Toby) and either he contacted Glen or Glen responded to the earlier page, We had several technical problems to work through this morning, but the most critical problem was trying to reach our support people.

"MidAmerican Gas Purchase Payment","Frank,

This email will confirm that MidAmerican will not be paid for the November gas purchase amount of $1,558,687.65, since they have already shortpaid their transportation invoice by this amount.  I spoke with Mark Walton in Finance this afternoon, and he said that they are aware of the situation and have already taken the appropriate actions to cancel the wire transfer that would have gone out to MidAmerican later this month.

Also, FYI,  I did check with the Contracts Group about payment terms in GISB agreements.  Section 7.2 of the GISB form stipulates the payment date as being the 25th day of the month following the month of delivery.

I spoke with Renee Perry in Gas Logistics this afternoon, and she is looking into compiling an invoice for finance charges on the balance shortpaid for the period November 12th - November 25th.

Please call me if you need further information.

Kay

			Caroline Barnes has indicated that you have a presentation put together that briefly covers the purpose and function of  Gas Logistics, and how this department  interacts with other departments. I was wondering if you would be interested in making the presentation to GMS personnel to better understand how Measurement impacts your department. Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conference room to be available.
			Thanks-

"Bushton Universe Gas Quality","Attached is an excel spreadsheet showing the gas quality at all the points in the Bushton Universe.  I have sorted the information by POI #, BTU content, carbon dioxide content, helium content, C6+ content and nitrogen content.  The POI listing is consistent with the official Bushton Universe list used for Gas Logistics purposes with the following exceptions:

	1. POIs # 71315 and # 71316 are not on the attached list since they are pooling points and will not have gas composition information.
	2. POI # 59685 Richfield Gas Storage/NNG Stevens is on the attached list twice.  The gas composition information is tied to meter # 658429 and the throughput activity is reported by the summation meter # 660018.
	3. POI # 1309 CNG/Beaver  - C Line Receipt is including in the attached data since the CNG Beaver processing plant is not running at this time.  The CNG volume is flowing to the Bushton Plant as strangers gas.  

Once everyone has gotten a chance to look at this information I would like to have another meeting to discuss the data.  A video conference has been set as follows:

	Day			Thursday
	Date			January 3, 2002
	Time			1:30 to 3:00 pm
	Location		42C2 Houston and 696 Omaha

Feel free to give me a call if you have questions.

"RE: Northern vs. Oneok:  Oneok measurement settlement","Based on this,  I assume the memo is being changed to say that ""the agreed upon measurement volume for the period is 567,546.5.""  I'm ok with the letter-  
Do we need to send the dispute resolution letter as a precaution in case Oneok wants to change this settlement.  Or should we have them send us confirmation that the dispute response is suspended pending final resolution of this agreement.  MK

		Charlie sent me the following message.
		""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
		As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"FW: PNR Balance on PNM Cr# 25672 - PO# 27190","Laura,
Based on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience. The gas is currently ""parked"" at the Rio Puerco PNR point, POI# 500617. Since the Purchase Order# 27190 expired on 4/30/2000, PNM will have to use their current PNR contract (Cr# 27267).  I have asked Richard Hanagriff to transfer the quantities from PO# 27190 to Cr# 27267. 

In your discussions with PNM you might verify that Imbalance Statements should continue to be sent to Sally Prentice at Alvarado Square in Albuquerque, NM. (TW has been sending an imbalance statement on this 10,000 Dth to Sally each month)  

If you have any questions, please call me.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

"daily capacity","As discussed in our morning meeting the other day, NNG has a few points that have been approved as points that could potentially have daily capacity (capacity available for some time frame less than 30 days) throughout this winter.  The attached file shows the points and the volume level that have been approved as points which may have daily capacity.  As long as the amount of daily capacity that is determined to be available is within the points/volumes listed on this report, Omaha Planning will be able to post the capacity on our daily capacity report for 1 hour then we are able to sell it.  If we exceed the volumes on this file or have capacity at other points, the capacity change will need to be routed for approval.

At this time, we don't have any short term sustainable (capacity available for at least one month but less than 150 consecutive days) to post for this winter.  If anyone is aware of short-term sustainable capacity that needs to be posted, please let me know.

As changes are made to this list, I will forward them on to you.  Beginning November 1, this posting (without the items in blue type) will be on our website.  Finalized posting procedures for NNG will be completed by Michele Winckowski and forwarded to everyone.  Please send this email on to the rest of the people on your teams.  Thanks.

Portions of the minutes need to be revised and should not be distributed to anyone else as is.  The minutes include some misinformation, and most statements have someone's name associated with them.

I know it is difficult, if not impossible, for one person to accurately capture everything that was discussed or stated during a day-long meeting.  My comments in no way reflect on Todd or his note taking abilities.  At our next meeting I would like to discuss our meeting minutes and the extent of the discussion that we try to capture.  Without a transcript, capturing all of the details of the entire day's discussion is impossible.

I would like to extend the comment date one week to next Friday, December 14.  This will give me time to draft and submit comments.

Thank you for your assistance,

"GPM Dumas Plant Information","I talked to Lavila Lawrence with Duke Energy Field Services, LP. and she advised me that the GPM Dumas Plant (POI 18058) is going to be shutdown effective January 1, 2002.  They will diverting some of the gas to other pipelines and any gas that will be coming to NNG will come through interconnects that David Moon takes care of in the Texas Panhandle.  

She said ""They wouldn't have to de-rhime that plant anymore!"", which gave me the impression that the cost of maintenance might be the reason for the shutdown.

Any questions, please call.

"RE: Post Rock K# 104759","Loren/Larry, we have been trying to locate a Marketer for Post Rock for some time now.  Post Rock is now our only hold-out that has not signed their extension agreement so that we could send them their Rate Case Refund invoices that are dated 9/1/1999 so becuase of that, all of those invoices are still sitting on our accounts receivable account plus they have not yet paid their Reservation invoices for
Nov. 2000 thru March 2001.  The Market Service Rep (Randy Janzen and Harry Woodson) was going to call them to today to find out why they hadn't paid their Reservation invoices but we may need help from Marketing to see if we can get this extension agreement signed.  Please let me know if you have talked with anyone at Post Rock and if you need anything from our group.

Thanks,

Raetta

Raetta,

	You called with a few questions about Post Rock K# 104759; Larry and/or Loren should be able to assist you.  Post Rock apparently thought this agreement had a one year term.  It seems we amended the deal, unilaterally, to extend their term to 5 years (per note in the Envision file).  You stated that Post Rock has not paid any of their invoices in nearly a year which leads me to believe they consider the deal terminated (are they nominating on this contract?).  Larry or Loren is the Account Manager for Post Rock (both names appear in the file) so they should field your questions. 

Craig

"RE: Storage Desk 3rd Party Storage Procedures","Reyna and Michele,

What do you think of the idea that We place the NNG and Procedures for Offsystem Transactions in a header to the document with Michele's as Part A - Initiation & Regulatory; Reyna's Part B - Deal making and Mine Part C Nominations & Scheduling. From that the procedures could be subdivide for 3rd Party storage or transportation.

Reyna... also in your Part B & C Specific Deal & Fuel....It is Gas Logistics' recommendation that Marketing e-mail the Deal/Purchase sheet to Chris and Debbie with copies going to Lynn and Myself. That way in Chris' absence, someone can follow up on the nom/scheduling.

Subject: Producer meeting


The meeting yesterday with about 7 small producers in Okla went fairly well.  It is obvious that they now realize that the cost of processing, if necessary is there obligation, not Northerns.
We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it
 
Timing---  we said we would attempt to get back to them mid January--  
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to call myself or Dave N.

"IT Weekly Tip - Use vCards to share your contact info with clients and businesses","Below is a training tip on creating electronic business cards and links to training documents on Windows 2000 and Outlook.   Each week a training tip is added to the documentation, and I will foward on as new topics are added.  

I would be happy to do brown bag training sessions at lunch or as time permits on topics of interest.   If you have any questions or would like me to setup a session, please give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )
	- Find and select your name
	- Double-click your name or click Properties
	- Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep. 
2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard
	- Close any open messages

	- Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name
	- Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create)
Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go.

"Gas Logistics Update","Thank you for taking time to come to our Gas Logistics Staff meeting on Tuesday.  My apologies to those individuals that were inadvertently dropped from the email distribution.  I will schedule time to visit with anyone that missed the staff meeting.

I know that you are all still searching for answers to the Enron events of the last few weeks.   You asked lots of good questions at the meeting.  At the bottom of this email are responses to a few additional questions.  As I said at the meeting, while I am discouraged by recent events, I am really proud of ETS and of our Gas Logistics Team and I am looking forward to showing off our pipeline successes to the Dynegy management team in the future. 

With the Thanksgiving holiday just around the corner, I'd like to take the opportunity to wish you and your family a safe and happy holiday season.  I hope that you can spend time with your families and friends away from the demands of work.  I'd also like to put two dates on your calendar to celebrate work accomplishments with our team.

Team Celebration.  First, I hope you can attend a celebration on November 29 at the Doubletree honoring the Gas Logistics team and the new Contracts/Capacity Release team.  The celebration will include food, games and prizes.  Alma Carillo will be sending out all the details.  
Holiday Luncheon.  Second, get out your recipe books and start cooking, because it's also time for our Gas Logistics Holiday Banquet on December 11th in ECN42C2 from 11:30am - 1:30pm.  I'll provide the ham and turkey and team members can sign-up to bring a covered dish.  Ricki Winters will send around a sign-up sheet to make sure that we don't end up with 10 green bean casseroles. 

Follow-Up Q/A

Can Employees still order computers from the Click at Home program?
As of today, the Click at Home program has not been cancelled.  The web site is working and eligible employees are able to place orders.

Regarding loans from the Saving Plan, is there any requirement for accelerated loan payment if the value of the loan exceeds the current value of the savings plan account?
For active employees, loan payment amounts will not change during the term of the loan, even if the outstanding balance of the loan exceeds the value of the account.

Does the company have any position on employee participation in class action suits?  
No.  The decision whether to participate in a suit is a personal decision and is unrelated to an individual's employment.

Subject:	Performance Evaluation due dates

Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks and have a great holiday!

Subject:	Duke Field Services Contract

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts.

Subject:	Williams visit

I have spoken with Williams, and two representatives will be here Monday at 9:00 AM. Frank Billings and Greg Pointer are the two gentlemen that will be visiting us and they will have the reception desk call John when they get here.

As mentioned, their main interest is going to be how we manage the commercial transactions of the MOPS asset for NNG as well as our joint venture partners.  They will also be interested in discussing the interim service agreement and what services we will be able provide.  They have not provided us enough information to date to develop a definitive agreement, but after this visit they should be in a position specify what they need us to do. The physical operations of the asset is currently contracted to Enron Operations, LP, and that contract can be assigned by NNG to Williams.  It is possible they may have questions regarding the billing and allocation of the operating cost, and if so Betty Jamison may be able to provide insight on those.

Thanks for your help,

Bob

"October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status","	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

If they were to schedule their gas directly to Golden Spread POI- 71395, operations could put them on the suction side of Plains turbine if we got full. Also Golden Spread would have to agree to flow the gas on a 24 hour basis and not 16 hour day.

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

"Dr. Appointments - Eye and Diabetes","Due to the complications I am having with my right eye following the Lasik Enhancement, I am going to be going to the eye doctor more frequently than planned.

I have another appointment at the eye doctor tomorrow Thursday, the 13th @ 2:15 pm.  Since this will basically consume most of the afternoon I went ahead and made a follow-up appointment with my primary care doctor.  He has increased my diabetes Rx and needs to evaluate it's effectiveness.

"Capacity Posting Procedures","	
	Effective November 1, 2001, Northern implemented new posting procedures regarding capacity availability.  These procedures are attached.  Several changes have been implemented.  In summary, the following changes have been incorporated:

The Unsubscribed Capacity Report has been updated to reflect the gas day two (2) days in the future vs fourteen (14) days.
a ""new"" Short Term Sustainable Capacity (STSC) Report has been posted beginning on the November 1st gas day.  This report is displayed on Northern's website under the Informational Posting; Capacity; Unsubscribed Capacity  
a ""new"" rolling 30 day Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report is posted each morning for day-to-day transactions.  Daily capacity can be posted by point or group but must be identified with an asterisk (*) on the STSC Report at least one business day before being posted on the Unsubscribed Daily Capacity Report.   

	Please take a moment to review these report on the website.  If I have left anyone off this distribution that may be affected or interested in the procedures, please forward on.  If you have any questions or concerns regarding these procedures please let me know.  Thanks MW

I know that in the past we may have paid the shippers early but our policy has always really been to not pay them until the due date.

Subject:	Richardson Products Non-payment of Invoices

FYI - 

In case you have not yet heard... Richardson Products has not paid their $1,661,000 TW line pack sales invoice.  They are claiming to have a Global Netting Agreement with Enron and are netting this payment with ENA and EGL issues.  We asked for a copy of this agreement even though we are certain that TW is not a party to it.

Paul Cherry, TK, Steve Kleb and I are all following up with our counterparts and are giving the collection of this money top priority.  We will keep you informed.

"TW's Firm Capacity Procedures","Attached is the current version of TW's Firm Capacity Procedures.  (Posting requirements are defined in another document.)  These procedures outline the definitions of certificated/sustainable, operational/short-term sustainable and operational non-sustainable capacity and how we will determine how much and when capacity is available in each of these categories.

I thought I would go ahead and distribute this because there have been some questions - though I understand some of the recent FERC rulings may require us to change the procedures as it concerns, among other things, whether operational/short-term sustainable capacity is sold under LFT vs. daily under FTS-1.

"Draft to Measurement","As of today, we have e:mailed a list by station ( 7 and/or 16 day charts) to the Measurement Group that need to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes for the following shippers:

MidAmerican - 147 stations - to date, Measurement has corrected 44 stations

IES - 87 stations

Interstate Power - 6 stations

Wisconsin Power & Light - 11 stations

In order for us to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send us updates as to what station numbers have or haven't been done.  We would also like to make sure that they have even received all of these October, 2001 charts by December 14 and if they haven't, we would like to know which ones they are so that we could help by calling the field personnel to get those charts in ASAP and also, if we could do that for them, then they could continue to input the corrected readings while we chase down the charts they are missing.  We have given Measurement a date of January 3, 2002 (which is the last time that we run prior periods) for the date that we would like to have all of these done, but the sooner they get those done, the better because we would like to have plenty of time to review them and make sure that they are correct.  To make that happen, it would help us if they could be done by December 19, which will be the first time that we run prior periods.  If we wait until the January 3rd date, we will only have 1 day to check these invoices to make sure that they are all correct.

Lynn/Rick, I think that Jodie and I need your help in conveying this to Measurement along with copying all of the other people that have been involved with this to make sure that they (Meas.) know the importance of getting this done.  We are depending solely on them to get this accomplished for us and we just want to make sure that they read all of the stations that we sent them because we want to avoid doing multiple priors on the same months production.  Please let us know if you need any other information.

Thanks,

Jodie and Raetta

Mike,

I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 

Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  

Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

"TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Offer","All:  

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.

An Update from Northern Border Pipeline's
Customer Services and Gas Control Departments

No: 2001-21                                                    Date: October
26, 2001



Web Site Change

On Monday, October 29, the look and feel of Northern Border Pipeline's informational
posting site will officially change.  In addition, the URL tied to the site
will be slightly modified.

The new main URL will be www.nbpl.enron.com (nbpl versus nbp).  We recognize
that it may take a bit of time for this subtle abbreviation change to sink
in.  Consequently, our server has been set up to redirect anyone using the
previous informational posting web address to the new site.  But for those
more detailed URL addresses that have been set up in a browser or portal
site to link directly to information posted in the old site, this changeover
will not be as friendly; be aware that those specific addresses will be retired
along with the old site.

As for the new web site layout, it has been purposely built under a ""simpler
is better"" philosophy.   It will not win any artistic design awards.   But
for the purpose of providing information, we believe that functionality of
an informational posting web site should always overrule show.  We hope that
you will agree.

It also should be noted that the new site design is not totally new and untested;
it closely parallels the solution we implemented earlier this year for Midwestern
Gas Transmission, our sister pipeline company.   So those who have accessed
information recently on MGT should be familiar with the layout.

As always, we are open to suggestions.  Please let us know what you think.

We have some end user daily volumes that are more than the physical daily volume at their related TBS (which also may have to do with the problem that we have with 16 and 31 day charts not being read) - when that happens we end up overbilling the LDC.

Subject: IES October SMS Invoice


Chris,

I just got done reviewing some of the data in the October SMS invoice for IES and I can see some major problems.  It looks to me like about 1/2 of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in both Zone BC and Zone D.

It was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(2870), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.

I need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even very good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bill us for DDVC's.  

From now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for. 

Thanks,
Jeff

Subject:	Alliant-WP&L Write-Off Spreadsheet and  Request Agreement


Chris:

Per out conversation a few weeks ago,  I'm attaching WP&L's Spreadsheet showing
""ALL"" Contracts, DDVC and Imbalance invoices outstanding.
 << File: WPL_AR_JBRB_22500_102201.xls >> 

As you will note this is the same spreadsheet that accompanied the packet to WP&L,
no data has changed.   Its been sometime but perhaps you might have archived the
packet that I forwarded to you at that time, it did include the invoices as well as the
spreadsheet.   Also, see the last page of the Spreadsheet which gives you a breakout
total for each category (Contracts,DDVC and Imbalance) for writeoff.

Also, attached is the Writeoff Agreement Form with a brief explanation and the
required approval signatures.   Perhaps the  explanation is not the appropriate verbage,
I certainly do welcome you editing if this does not meet with your approval.


 << File: WP&L_WRITEOFF_SEBESTA_1997_98_98_10_22_01.doc >> 
WP&L's Current Business is clean, if this historical business is approved for write-off,
we will then have a complete clean slate with WP&L.   Chris, I wished I had a better
option, however as soon as you have had an opportunity to review and digest the attached
informaton, I'll be happy to discuss at your earliest convenience if we need further
 clarification of the spreadsheet or the approval form.

Subject:	Communication Alternatives in Crisis/Disaster/Outage Situations

In Shelley's staff meeting this morning, she expressed concern about situations (like the one we are currently experiencing) in regard to e-mail and electronic communication channel availability to customers.  Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team.  In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges.  With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term;  

1.)  An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access.  Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming.  A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed.  The service should be available from remote locations.  I am currently investigating this issue.  (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 

2.)  A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information.  There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties.  The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. 

I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  

Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution.

During the course of the conversation, they requested an IT contact who would be able to help them determine the system requirements necessary.  John gave them your name and we told them we would forward your telephone number to their attention this morning.

Should you have any questions, please advise -- thanks.

2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

"Fire Drills and Emergency Response","To:		Gas Control
From: 		Shelley Corman
Subject: 	Fire Drills and Emergency Response

Periodically we review our procedures during fire drills in the building. Historically, I understand that the Gas Controllers on duty have not moved to the stairwells during a drill. We need to change that practice. We are required by the Fire Marshall to have everyone move to the stairwells during future fire drills. The short time normally required to be away from the console until the all-clear is sounded should not impact the integrity of the pipeline systems. 

We are also reviewing our short notice emergency response procedures. We have excellent procedures for events such as hurricanes, but we are preparing for events, such as a threat that would require everyone to leave the building immediately. Our interim offsite location in these situations is the Enron hanger at Intercontinental Airport. In the near future, we will be conducting a drill of these procedures, so don't be surprised if someone from our management team comes into Gas Control and asks you to proceed to the hanger on short notice. 

Thanks in advance for your co-operation, and thank you for the great job everyone is doing.

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to ""shippers"", we could refer to ""customers"" instead.

Subject:	RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

"Red Phone Locations","
I have checked on the status of the 's after the move and they play a critical role in our communication plan if the Lucent phones are down.  (Big backhoes can dig ditches and accidentally cut cables as we have seen in the past.)  The 's  are outside of our current Lucent phone switch and give us
the ability to make outside calls.  

Currently 's  are located and connected correctly at the following locations:
	John Buchanan  EBN4270
	Pat Barry  EBN4279
	Tracy Minter EBN3979  

But, we need additional 's  installed at the following locations:
	Terry Kowalke  EBN3972
	Jack Howard EBN3910E
	Sherry Forbish EBN4275A

This will accommodate Gas Logistics interim phone coverage plan between moves.  Please check to determine if the cost of these additional installations were included in the regular move schedule.  If you have any questions, please advise.  We will place a ' at the reconnection site.  
Thanks for you assistance.

"RE: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points","Lynn,

In reviewing the Duke contract 27291, I did find that the rate was not correct for four months in the past year.  I also reviewed Duke contract 27349 since it also had the same type of alternate to California deal.  Two months on the second contract were not billed correctly.  If Marketing can input the correct rates into the system, I can regenerate the invoices and bill Duke immediately.  Please see the attached file for details.

Thanks,  Bert

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I contacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a business reason and director level approval is required before any restoration work can begin. 
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sheet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. In addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track potential imbalance activity on NNG's system. 
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the restoration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can continue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Departments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.
Thanks,
Mike

"Market Point Allocations","Beginning  10/1/2001, TMS stopped excluding city gates locations from the allocation, thereby they would be subject to allocation, where they were not before,  this was requested by John Buchanan.  Unfortunately or fortunately, NNG customers do not nominate a large portion of their gas to theses city gate locations, rather they nominate to the zone locations, so there is a 99.9% probability, that these city gates would never have to be allocated any way.  

Currently in TMS we exclude the zone nomination locations (OPS type) from the allocation process.  Therefore my question is, since we wanted to include the city gates in the allocation process do we also want to include the zone delivery locations in the allocation process?  Bewlow is a list of OPS type points.

Subject:	Actual Volumes in TMS for October 26th

There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.  The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.  In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.  I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.

Here is the file you sent me with the following changes:

1.  Question 1: added a comment line after the column headings explaining that Interruptible contracts may be extended from month to month unless terminated on 30 days' notice by either party.  Mary Kay thought we needed some explanation why those contracts showed termination dates in the past.  I eliminated this line, along with the headers, on the CD version of the file.

2.  Question 3:  I just changed the alignment on the text cells for the 3 comment records at the bottom from Centered to Left.

The training would go from 12:00 PM - 4:30 PM on 11/15/01 and would cover any nomination/scheduling questions they have.  Xcel has also asked to have someone there to specifically address capacity release and the final AM true-up process.

Please let me know who you would recommend as representatives from NNG.  I would like to get back to Xcel by this Thursday regarding our attendees.

"RE: Oneok","I just spoke to Terry regarding the September dispute.  He is willing to spilt the difference if we can come up with an appropriate letter agreement .  He would like us to draft a letter stating that both parties are agreeing to a negotiated volume/dollar amount.  The language should state that both parties are not setting a precedence and are not waiving any existing rights.  The volume/dollar amount is not based on anything specific.  Please do not send dispute notice response.  I believe that we will have a deal.

He is also mentioned that we should see their response to the test protocol tomorrow.

They received the CO2 response and it was what he expected.  They are currently claiming Force Majuere on their Praxair contract, but have not been sued yet. They were pleased with the fact that we are posting a quality reminder and are feeling better about their chances of a commercial solution with CIG.

They are also planning to send us some kind of communication (demand letter) on EPPI.  

Sorry for the abbreviated note.  If you have questions, call me.

"RE: End-user Agreement Processes","I agree with Lynn's comments with one exception. My understanding is that PGAS was to be simply a vehicle to provide the end user volumes to Gas Logistics, in addition to the TBS volumes, as is current practice. We want to pursue having these volumes supplied to Measurement  via email so that they can be imported electronically. Again, these are not  OMVs in the traditional sense, since custody transfer has occurred on the TBS volumes. There is currently no mechanism in place to compare the TBS volumes to the end user volumes other than manually. Additionally, due to the time of the month that these numbers are received, I'm not sure that there is sufficient time to argue the accuracy of the numbers . Currently, paragraph 4. of the End User agreement states ""The Shipper's transportation agreement will be billed on the actual measured takes at the End User's POI."" It does not address any differences between the TBS volumes, positive or negative, other than Shipper is responsible for any imbalances resulting from the measured volumes at the End User POI. There are no provisions to challenge the accuracy of the numbers being supplied. Lynn is probably right that we will need some  additional discussions on this.
Thanks-
Gary

Subject:	RE: End-user Agreement Processes

	I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meeting yesterday.  

		1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical
	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.

		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were
	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that
	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).

		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for
		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be
		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by
		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the 
		     TBS connected to NNG.

		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including
		     End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS.

	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:

		1.  Measurement should either:

			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end
			     user point higher than their TBS.

			b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk
			     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.

		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will
		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

	Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.
	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are
	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be
	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.

	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.
Thanks,
Joe

"RE: Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure","	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.  

	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.

	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.  

	I believe we have provided the answers we committed to in the meeting yesterday for today.  I plan to meet with Lynn B. tomorrow to discuss nominations, contract approval processes and other stuff.....  I'll let you know where we are as things develop.  thanks MW

Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.

Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.

Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.

Recorded in December:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.

If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.


Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.

Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).

"RE: NNG - South End Small customer deliveries","Lynn,

Thanks for the additional input from the Gas Logistics experts.  I think you are correct that a long term solution will require acceptance of procedural changes by Oneok.  I think the Richfield storage idea should be looked at.  To my knowledge, there isn't any storage activity at this field but maybe there could be.  

In the mean time, I am going to propose that we put an OBA in place for the new customer I am trying to satisfy right now.  The OBA can be revoked on 48 hours notice if we can come up with a better idea.  I have strung this guy along as long as I can.  I will let everyone know when we pick this issue up again.

Subject:	NNG - South End Small customer deliveries


	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at ""small customer delivery points""
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be
	     required in the ""Bushton Universe"", just not as restrictive as it is today.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Information Request for LS Power FDD Overrun Analysis

Mike,

Kent and Tim called me this morning and said that they have received a letter from LS Power requesting compensation for costs they feel they incurred to adjust their supply due to cuts on their FDD overrun.  Their analysis applies to the period June 1, 2001 to present.  Kent and Tim need data to perform an analysis that will be used to respond to LS Power's (USES) request.

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days. 
 Electronic copies of each of your final month end sum sheets for June forward.

They want to answer the customer within a week, so they'll need this information at least by early next week.  Kent has requested that all of the information be sent to both him and Tim.

Thanks for your help!

Kay

Subject:	FW: Request Submitted: Access Request 000000000078904

John & Terry,

My understanding is this request was to allow the changes EPNG might institute to be automatically accessed without our losing our ability to nominate in the new Passport system.  In the past, when EPNG institutes updates (I seem to recall the phrase, ""changing the Java script""), we are unable to access Passport 2000.  I also understand efforts are underway to get this worked out with EPNG ""IT"" without our being given administrative access.  Scott had advised IT around the first of November that the old Passport would be suspended.

EPNG has extended the date to January 6th for the old Passport system to be suspended.  After that time, until whatever is worked out between the IT groups, when the EPNG updates occur, we will be unable to electronically confirm.  I would be interested in knowing how this has affected TWPL.  I had understood Beverly encountered no difficulties at any time.

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

"SLA Settlement","

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Subject:	Daily Measurement


I looked at the tariff and talked to Mary Darveaux.  NNG must have true daily measured volumes, as opposed to a monthly measurement divided by days in the month, for several business reasons.

References to daily volumes and calculations are sprinkled throughout the tariff.
1.  For example, under the TF & TFX Rate Schedules, the tariff states that the MDQ (maximum daily quantity) is the firm service that NNG is obligated to provide on a daily basis.  We can't provide a daily service if we do not have daily measurements.
2.  Curtailment provisions in the tariff require DAILY measurement.
3.  DDVCs require accurate DAILY measurement.  DDVCs are a part of NNG's revenue.  Even if NNG were to bill on scheduled volumes at the beginning of the month, true-up to actuals would be required.  DDVCs would not disappear, they would simply move from the commodity billing to imbalance billing after measurement close.  Order 637 may change some aspects of DDVCs but it will not eliminate them or change the daily nature of the abuses DDVCs are designed to discourage.

Furthermore - 
1.  That's the way the gas transportation industry operates.  It may not be a GISB standard, but it is a fact of life.  
2.  Most contracts executed through EOL are for 1-2 days of service at a time.  Gas flowing at a point could vary significantly during the month and a point may be used by different parties at different times.  We can't just assume that the same amount flowed every day for everyone.
3.  Overrun charges are based on gas flows above the contract MDQ (Maximum DAILY Quantity) each day of the month.  Using an artificial, average daily measurement would mask overrun volumes (and reduce NNG revenue, since Overrun pays a higher rate than firm commodity).  A shipper could avoid paying overrun if it flowed below MDQ on some days and above on others.
4.  We have several contracts with volumetric provisions which cannot be accurately billed without DAILY measurements.  An example would be Utilicorp and all of its Taconite contracts.
5.  NNG is looking at moving to daily dollar-valued OBAs.  If NNG can't tell what is flowing on a daily basis, customers can game the system by pushing extra gas into the pipe on days when the price is lower and withdrawing it on other days when the price is slightly higher.  Gas prices can fluctuate considerably during the month.  Multiplied times a bcf of gas, even a fraction of a cent change adds up to real money.

"A draft Business Continuity Plan for a Short or No Notice Evacuation of the Enron Building","
Bob, Jean, Scott, and I drafted this up. They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide
the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what 
I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, 
ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. 
The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. 

Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will
be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the
documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored 
at the Hangar. 

There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the
first test. 

Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid 
confusion during such an event. 

Thanks, Gary

Subject:	October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.
Thanks-
Gary

Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

Subject:	Re: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas   << OLE Object: StdOleLink >> 

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Raetta

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format.

"Results of Meeting on Storage Allocation Changes","The following summarizes the results of our meeting......If you want to discuss further, please call me.

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point
The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point. If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time. Changes  to CAS are required. I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days. 
Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug. 
 
Question:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?
 
Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity
The decision was made to table this concern for now. The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations. In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons. Further analysis is required. Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted. 

Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity
The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage. If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail. The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem. I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.

"Transok offsystem accounting","Here are some thoughs on how we would account for the Offsystem Storage.

Facts
NNG moves 100,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
I will look into Form 2 physical reporting changes.

Offsystem inventory is reduced  2,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction.

Case 1	In-Kind is replaced by simple purchase from 3rd party, NNG incurrs the cost.
Debit 803 (Gas Purchases) or 858 (Fuel exp)		2,000 * cost of gas
	Credit A/P						2,000 * cost of gas

Case 1 books all transactions outside of operational storage.  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.


Case 2	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, NNG incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP

Case 3	In-kind is replaced by Operational Storage, Tracker incurrs the cost
Debit 816 (Storage Fuel exp)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 812 (Storage Fuel Credit)		2,000 * MIP

Debit 808 (Storage Withdrawal)		2,000 * MIP
	Credit 1174 (Encroachment)		2,000 * MIP
	
Debit 1823 (Storage Fuel Tracker)	2,000 * MIP
	Credit 805 (Storage Fuel Recovery)	2,000 * MIP

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

"Bushton Balance through 10-26-01 - UPDATE - Please disregard previous Bushton Report for 26th!","I talked to Steve in NNG Gas Control to see why we had such a difference in the PVR Shrink for the 26th.  He is showing the volume for the PVR measured @ 96.7 which would be only a 2,481 difference and make the monthly only 4,654 difference.  I also went out into PGAS and confirmed the volume measured was indeed 96.7 dth.  Apparently we have an issue between PGAS and the TMS system.

I will get with Harry, the PGAS group, and the TMS in the morning to see if we can figure out what is going on.  So please disregard the Bushton Report for the 26th.

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

"Packets ending October 2001","Hi everyone,
Here we are almost at month end, and as of gas day 10/29/2001, almost all shippers need adjustments to their nominations in order to balance to zero by 10/31/2001.  OGE is about the only shipper that is totally balanced out.  Some shippers need bigger adjustments than others.   Please remind your shippers that any balance left will transferred to their Park & Ride contract where they will incur a carry-over MIC on November 1, 2001, plus they will also incur a penalty MIC on their packet for the month of October.

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Subject:	RE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues

I've talked with Vernon.  I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of town 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max overrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month.  If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits.

Affects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the first 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.
In practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6000.

Another Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For example, on 108489, MDQ=73,500 so 5%=3675.  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=110,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?

Rita,

Not to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).  So there is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized overrun classification.

I wouldn't want to do a discount because of ""full rate equivalent"" issues. I like the exception better with a note in a file or something to explain it.  But I defer to Steve on this.

Subject:	RE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues
Importance:	High

Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma

1) just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box.
2) I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question, setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate.  Then it would not look like a discount.  However, there is no way to attach a comment to an exception.

Considerations:
The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount (but this isn't really a discount).
The discount (but not the exception) would show up on the 592 report - but nobody reads that, anyway.
When they nominated as max rate overrun, it got scheduled.  Since they had a right to firm service, they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly, so they didn't really get an unfair advantage over other TI.

Steve & Dari - what do you think?

Lynn,

Earlier this month, I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100% of their firm commodity as overrun.  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month.  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldn't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly.  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting, I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either.  

Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th?

Thanks!
Vernon

	NOTICE OF COMPLIANCE FILING

	(October 22, 2001)

Take notice that on October 17, 2001, Texas Gas Transmission Corporation
(Texas Gas) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First
Revised Volume No. 1, the  following tariff sheets to become effective
October 1, 2001:

                                Primary
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                Sheet No. 184 (reserved)
                                Second Revised Sheet No. 185
                                
                                Alternate
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 181
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 182
                                Alternate Third Revised Sheet No. 183
                                
Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the
Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced
docket.  As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index
price for cash-out.  In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a
cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the
weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following
month.  The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of
imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above
5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all
imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level
from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this
tier of imbalance.

Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed
to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington,
D.C. 20426, in accordance with Section 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and
Regulations.  All such protests must be filed in accordance with Section
154.210 of the Commission's Regulations.  Protests will be considered by the
Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not
serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings.  Copies of this filing
are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.
This filing may also be viewed on the web at http://www.ferc.gov using the
""RIMS"" link, select ""Docket#"" and follow the instructions  (call
202-208-2222 for assistance).  Comments, protests and interventions may be
filed electronically via the Internet in lieu of paper.  See, 18 CFR
385.2001(a)(1)(iii) and the instructions on the Commission's web site under
the ""e-Filing"" link.

Subject: Maintenance Window-Saturday, Oct 27


While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

	 	Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out.
		I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on
		your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two
		""old"" teams merging.

		For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the
		operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's
		desk.

		Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which
			is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.

		Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and
			Scott has ElPaso as Operator.

		Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the
			gathering

		The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up
		reps. 

			GPM Monthly Pricing Report
			Lamar Power Plant True Ups
			PVR Report
			Oneok Gathering Reporting
			NNG Administrative Contracts
			SPS Power Plant True Up
			Conoco Power Plant True Up
			MOPS Daily Report
				
		The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:

			Duke/GPM
			Oneok
			Transcanada
			Dynegy
			Reliant
			ElPaso
			West Texas Gas

Lynn/Rick, Frank sent this to me last week and I have been working on it but I have one item for $1,406.01 that was listed on a report that Frank had that I can't seem to find on the A/R - maybe Alice can help me find it.  After I find that entry, I was going to get it to Jean Blair to get the writeoff forms written up.

Brad,

This is what I would like to convey to the users at this time.  Also, let everyone know that I am available to attend their individual staff meetings.


The Business Objects IT staff is currently in the process of upgrading the hardware and software for Business Objects.  The hardware will provide better processing times and more stability.  The software upgrade will provide some bug fixes and enhancements.

As far as the effect to the users, the impact should be minimal.  

If the users accesses Business Objects through InfoSource.ETS.Enron.com, there will be no changes.
If the users accesses BO through ZABO, they will need the new version installed.  This will accomplished through a Corp script that will either push the new software onto the users PC or they will have to select a Start menu item.

The go live date is Dec 1.

Lori Saffer will be sending reminder e-mails as the deadline approaches.  

Thank you for all your help,
Lori Saffer

"End User Measurement","Lynn & Raetta,  In a conference call with Frank Semin, Courtney Barker, Gary Anderson and Ellis Stern today it was discussed on how the end of the month volumes have been estimated in the past dealing with 16 and 31 days charts.  Also, it was discussed on how this affects DDVC and other penalties that are billed from a Gas Logistics perspective.  Frank is needing to respond to MidAmerican on how NNG actualizes daily volume at their untelemetered (chart/index) end user points.  Frank would like to schedule a meeting with Gas Logistics, Marketing (Dave Neubauer), GMS (Gary Anderson, Ellis Stern) to discuss the end user agreements and the procedures that GMS uses when determining actual flow at the end user points.  Frank wants all parties within ETS to be aware of some to the issue involved in this process.  

Lynn & Raetta,  could you schedule some time to discuss.  I would like to bring you up to speed on the previous conversations and calls that I have had with Marketing, MidAmerican and GMS on this subject. 

I will be out of the office on Wed and Fri. this week if that helps.  I'm pretty flexible other than that.   Give me a call if you have any questions

"RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas","The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today's business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.

Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

Thanks,

Raetta

Thanks for looking into this for me Raetta.  I talked to Jim Banker this week and asked for him to check and see if they were charged for any penalty gas or not.  He said that he would let me know if they had.  He also stressed that we still need to see the actual daily volumes instead of average daily volumes on the volume statements.  I'm not quit sure if this part of the problem has been addressed yet or not.  Please let me know. Thanks Scott

I have looked at the DDVC invoices for Midwest for March, 2001 which total $304.70.  The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

Thanks,

Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

Dana,

Let me know if this is closer to what you want. 
There are three tabs in the report.
	 1) Summary by Customer
	 2) Summary by Amounts
	 3) Detail by Customer

The data is exported from SAP into an Excel spreadsheet. It takes 20 minutes to run the SAP report, export to Excel and format the Excel spreadsheet. A Business Objects report is refreshed (takes about a minute) to pick up the most current data from the Excel spreadsheet. 

The reports can be accessed directly from Business Objects if you prefer. I sent you the Business Objects report also.

"Notes from Critical Business Apps. meeting","These notes are very high level.
The goals of Brads meeting was to evaluate the need for the development of a systems diagnostic tool and to develop a process for notification of critical business application and hardware failure. This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed. 
Critical Business Application:
Outlook (Exchange Servers)
Mailman.Enron.com
Websites / Servers (all the www.hottap.enron.com there are eight in total)
EDI Hub
EDI Net
VPN
PGas
TMS
CMS
CRS
 	
Set up a process for notification of outages and customer notification:
Scott Abshire felt Blackberry would be very beneficial for internal communication due to the ability to send direct messages to one another inside the building.
Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging).
Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors.
Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland.
EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

Scott Abshrie and his group are all ready planned and budgeted a diagnostic tool, the first phase is for hardware and will be functional by yearend 2001. The second phase will be for applications in in service sometime in 2002. With this plan in place there is no need to duplicate efforts.

We heard the same rhetoric about the history, for the past 30 years it is has been a ""wet"" system and they entered into contracts without any processing obligations.  Northern' can't change due to this and historical operation and ""unwaive"" the high c6+ based on the highest receipt levels.  They (Dan?? ) was very insistent that if a problem occurred, all shippers should be pro rated and NNG's tariff should be enforced at the tailgate of the Bushton plant, not the point of receipt as the tariff currently states.  They asked us to file to change, potentially incorporate a default processing agreement that had to be used in the event of high concentrations of C6+--  I think you get the drift of the discussions--  don't just cut my gas, cut everyone
 
 
To Do's
We agreed to look at data from last year (assuming we have it available) to determine what the allocations would have been under the following scenarios:
        a)  Allocation as proposed-  highest levels
        b)  Allocation based on prorata at Bushton outlet
        c)  Allocation based on prorata at Demarc
 
Greg is to get in contact with Mitch Hertz (their attorney) to discuss feasibility of requiring gas quality waiver at the tailgate of Bushton:
          what FERC would do--
          what about other shippers--
          what is Bushton isn't running
          what about a default processing agreement being required
          Hypothetical allocations above, can FERC require
 
Dari,  can you find the status and outcome of a Southern docket filed last year?
 
Mary D.  validate that we can't require the plant to run--
 
Mike Loeffler-  check Oklahoma state proceeding to find any filing by Energex and Transok relating to gas being ""dry""  may not yet be filed---   need to watch for it

Mary and I met with Mary Kay regarding the filing for mandatory cash-out at constrained points.  Assuming the historical data will support and demonstrate an operational need, she is on board with this approach.  gh

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

Hi  Lynn,
 
Hadn't had a chance  to touch base with you since all of the Enron problems.  Wanted to let you  know how badly I feel for everything that has happened.  Enron is too fine  a company to have something like this happen.  You have so many great  employees in the organization.  Many, like yourself, I consider to be not  only business associates, but friends.
 
I just wanted to  send a quick note expressing my sorrow for all the stress you and others are  having to endure.  We support you 100%.  Things will get better.   
 
Hopefully, you can  find some joy in the upcoming holiday season.
 
Sincerely,
Bill

Subject: Storage Charges on Allocation Error Days


Tim,

In the attached file I have calculated the following charges that I have
incurred because of NNG incorrectly listing my project storage injection
rates in your allocation system. By far the biggest cost to me is the way we
have changed or nominations of natural gas from are suppliers as the
spreadsheet will show. We made this change in the nomination for July,
August & September. In calculating our nomination we look at what we could
put firm into storage, plant usage on none run days and SMS if available. If
this was fixed back in June when we asked what was going on with storage and
over runs into storage. I would have order large volumes of the Tier I
instead of purchasing the more costly Tier II. If we nominated the higher
Tier I volumes we expected to see DDVC charge of $.40 on all days trying to
over run into storage. That would have been the case the way your system was
set up. Instead I have these higher cost to my suppliers.

Please call me with any question on the spreadsheet. You can verify
Whitewater DDVC & SMS for September. I believe it was around the 18 or 19
when the problem was fixed.

Here is UtiliCorp Calculation of Charges that I inputed for Cottage Grove.

"Staff Meeting Notice and Performance Feedback Training","Please Send to ETS Gas Logistics Staff (Excluding Midland Control)

Please plan to join me on Wednesday, November 28 from 2-3 in 39C1 for a Gas Logistics staff meeting.  We will discuss company updates as well as questions about the PEP system.  

In addition, I have arranged for HR to conduct a training session on Effective Performance Feedback on Thursday, November 29 in Room ECN 5C2 from 1pm-3pm.  Roger Sumlin of the ETS Performance Improvement group will lead the session.  The concepts and techniques covered will help you be more effective in any feedback situation, such as providing feedback in PEP and in interactions with team members.  Roger will talk about what affects a person's openness to feedback and what a feedback giver needs to do to meet the feedback receiver's needs.   He will also review examples of good and bad statements entered in PEP and performance evaluation forms and talk about the importance of providing specific, useful and honest feedback that includes behavioral examples.   This session is voluntary, but I hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity to improve feedback effectiveness.  Please contact Tonja Trevino by Tuesday, November 27 to enroll in the session.  You may e-mail Tonja at <mailto:tonja.trevino@enron.com> or phone her at x30412.
