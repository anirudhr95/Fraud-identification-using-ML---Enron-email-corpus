John, that sounds good.  The feedback I have received indicates the 29th is the better date.  Please let me know when your schedule is finalized and I will get out a note to the folks here.  How much time do you think you need?  Would 130-330 or so work?  Thanks again, Tom.

Tom,
Lynn is in California until next Wednesday October 24th so I need to arrange the flights for this trip. So far it looks like either day is good for the meeting on Nominations and Scheduling so I will arrange for Lynn and I to come to Omaha on the 29th. We will arrive around 12:30pm and our flight will leave Omaha around 6:30pm.  
Please let me know if there is any problems with this timeline.

Thanks: John Buchanan

John Buchanan and Lynn Blair have offered to do a follow up session from yesterday's brown bag lunch to walk through the nomination and confirmation process.  They have offered to come to Omaha on 10/29 or 10/30 for a face to face training session.  Please let me know your availability on these days and I will get them lined up on whichever day looks to have the greatest turnout.  Also, if you know of others not included in this note who might be interested, please let them know.  Thanks, Tom.

"Meeting to discuss problems with Amarillo Natural Gas","Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

"Major Opps on the savings plan!","Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was mentioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled.  I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; when I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had been canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the system when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stating that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price, what happened to the float?

I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as they see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reported and clarified.

Thanks in advance!

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	""The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows.""

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

"Infrastructure Announcements: Transco, Petal Gas Storage, ANR's Kenosha Exp, Gulf South's Gulf Pines, CIG's Western Frontier","Note:  I have the Western Frontier certificate filing if anyone wants to see it.  LB
Petal Expansion, ANR Lateral Extension, Transco's Leidy Project OK'd 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued several important certificates Wednesday for new gas pipeline infrastructure projects, including final approvals for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, for a new pipeline by Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and for an ANR lateral extension to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. The Commission also denied rehearing of its orders granting Kern River Gas Transmission certificates to expand its system by about 135 MMcf/d. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe and about five miles of 30-inch diameter pipe mostly in western Pennsylvania. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
""The Commission's authorization is being granted based on our findings...that the proposed facilities will serve the public interest by increasing the pipeline capacity reaching the northeastern United States, thereby helping to meet the rapid growth in electric generation demand in that market,"" FERC said in its draft order. ""Since the overwhelming majority of the proposed facilities will be constructed either entirely within or immediately adjacent to existing pipeline or utility rights of way, the project's environmental impact will be minimized. Finally Transco's existing customers will not subsidize the project because the expansion shippers will pay an incremental rate."" 
Transco said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002.  The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing (25,000 Dth/d), PECO Energy Co. (30,000 Dth/d), Reliant Energy Services (25,000 Dth/d) and Williams Energy Marketing (50,000 Dth/d) are all customers. The incremental reservation rate for service on the expanded facilities is $13.56/Dth/month. 
The certificate granted to Petal Gas Storage LLC (see related story) covers a new pipeline that would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. The project is designed to deliver 700,000 Dth/d of gas to Southern Company's gas-fired generation in the Southeast. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral extension will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co.'s proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The project includes 13 miles of 20-inch diameter looping along ANR's Racine Lateral and a 10-mile extension of the lateral to the Badger plant. The project would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003. 
In the Kern River case, shippers had requested rehearing of FERC's order granting Kern authorization for its 124,500 Dth/d 2002 Expansion Project and an additional 10,500 Dth/d under its revised California Action project. Shippers claimed the project would allow the sale of additional delivery point rights at the Wheeler Ridge point in Southern California causing further pro rata reductions in capacity for existing shippers and diminishing their firm rights. Shippers said the Commission should subordinate the delivery point rights of expansion shippers to those of existing shippers until Southern California Gas builds enough takeaway capacity at Wheeler Ridge to accommodate the additional volumes. 
However, the Commission upheld its initial conclusion that the benefits of the project outweighed any risks of degrading delivery point rights, ""given the critical need for expansions of pipeline capacity to serve electric and natural gas infrastructure in California."" 
Gulf South Sees Strong Interest in $1 Billion Southeast Pipe 
Houston-based Gulf South Pipeline Co. LP, formerly Koch Gateway Pipeline, on Wednesday said the open season for the company's proposed $1 billion Gulf Pines Pipeline was ""extremely successful,"" adding that response to the 1 Bcf/d line from the Southeast markets far exceeded the company's expectations. The open season concluded on Sept. 19. 
The proposed 600-700 mile, 36-inch diameter or greater natural gas pipeline, which was first announced in August, is expected to originate in Mobile, AL, and extend through the states of Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina.
""The open season clearly confirmed that the demand exists for a competitive alternative to serve the growing power generation, commercial, residential and industrial markets in the southeastern United States,"" said Gulf South President Rolf Gafvert. 
The Gulf Pines project would interconnect with the existing Gulf South pipeline near Mobile Bay, enabling customers to access not only Mobile Bay supplies, but also gas supplies from Texas and Louisiana, including Venice and the Henry Hub, according to Gulf South, a subsidiary of Entergy-Koch LP. The proposed pipeline also would have access to multiple third-party storage facilities, such as Gulf South's facility in Bistineau, LA. 
""We anticipate that the projected growth of power plants will far exceed existing pipeline capacity in the southeastern region,"" said Gulf South spokesman Marc Palazzo. 
In addition to serving power generation, the company said Gulf Pines would extend farther east into the Carolinas than any existing interstate pipeline, bringing interstate pipeline service to a region that historically has not had service before. 
Palazzo said the project would be filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission next year. He added that the actual route of the proposed pipeline is still to be determined. Gulf South said the anticipated in-service date is sometime in 2004. 
Gulf South currently owns and operates 8,800 miles of pipeline with 33 compressor stations and 120 major pipeline interconnects extending from South Texas through the Gulf States and into the Florida market area. 
Williams Files to Build 400-Mile Western Frontier Pipe 
Williams Gas Pipeline has filed an application for a new $365 million pipeline that would extend from the Cheyenne hub in northern Colorado to multiple pipeline interconnections in southwestern Kansas and the panhandle of Oklahoma. The Western Frontier Pipeline would consist of 400 miles of 30-inch diameter pipe and 30,000 horsepower of compression. It would transport up to 540,000 Dth/d of gas to markets in the Midcontinent. 
In addition to an interconnection with the Williams Central system, Western Frontier proposes access to other major Midcontinent pipelines, including ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line, Northern Natural Gas, and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. Western Frontier also would have access to the growing Oklahoma intrastate markets via the Williams Central system. The pipeline is anticipated to be in service by Nov. 1, 2003. 
""Western Frontier Pipeline is a cost-effective, environmentally responsible way to transport natural gas from prolific Rockies supply basins to markets in the Midcontinent,"" said Kim Cocklin, senior vice president and general manager of Williams' Central and Texas Gas systems. ""We look forward to building this pipeline to help alleviate the current shortage of interstate pipeline capacity coming out of the region, which was recently cited by the U.S. Energy Information Administration.'' 
Customers interested in Western Frontier should contact Donny King at (270) 688-6968, Mark Elliott at (270) 688-6637 or Dale Sanders at (270) 688-6944. More information on Western Frontier is also available on the Internet at <http://westernfrontier.williams.com> .

"Changes to Operational Storage Capacity","It has come to my attention that changing the operational storage capacity between the Evening process and the NonGrid process can be unduly problematic for customers because most of the pipelines that interconnect with NNG do not recognize the NonGrid process. Such changes can lead to EPSQ issues during the ID1 process when shipper quantities cut during the NonGrid storage allocation end up being less than the EPSQ calculated for ID1. The differences that result will most probably end up as shipper imbalances on NNG. 
For this reason, it is strongly recommended that operational storage capacity not be changed between the Evening and the NonGrid processes in the future.

Looks like our work of hounding Oneok finally paid off.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

All testing was completed successfully, and we have confirmed with ENW Resolution Center that Exchange servers are up. 

Regarding yesterday's issues:
the ENW Resolution Center is researching further the cause of the Outlook problem that caused some people to get a login window when accessing their mail.  Some people in ETS did observe the problem, but because of the information the Resolution Center shared with us in the morning, our users were not greatly affected.
the IIS services were stopped and restarted on the server that supports access to the Flow Gas application.  We currently have no information about the root cause of the problem.

Subject: Storage Allocations

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to ""schedule"" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

Just in case any night owls are planning to access our customer activity site on Wednesday, October 24, HotTap will be unavailable starting at 10:30 p.m. CCT.   

If all goes well, HotTap should be back before midnight.  The worst-case scenario would extend this planned outage till 3:30 a.m. Thursday morning.

If things don't go well   with friends that we choose.   Our friendship we know   we could always lose.    But do we give our   family the same respect?   I think not, no wonder   they get so upset.    Our families are precious   in life, they're the best part.   So don't do and say things   that upset the cart.    [IMAGE]  If you've said or done   something that's got them upset.   Tell them you're sorry   put the bad feelings to rest.    If they have upset you   tell them how you feel.

"Marketer for Post Rock Gas","Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

"Potential Customer","Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

"Northern Natural Gas","I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

"FBI: Bin Laden may target Gas Industry","WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 - ""The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death"", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined reliability.""

The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed.""

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

"RE: Offsystem Capacity","Michele, 
Under the Accounting Procedures section, the second bullet states: ""Northern will account for any costs of third party transportation service through general ledger Account 858 - Transmission and Compression of Gas by Others"".  I propose that NNG use Account 859 - Other (Transmission) Expense rather than Account 858 for these third party transportation service costs.  
The Code of Regs states for Acct 858, ""This account shall include amounts paid to others for the transmission and compression of gas of the utility.""  However, it is specifically stated in the second paragraph of your Offsystem Capacity procedures, ""Northern will not hold title to any natural gas stored or transported on a third party facility.""  Thus, the use of Account 858 contradicts NNG's intent of not taking possession of the gas.  
Also, the use of Account 859  for transportation service costs would be very consistent with the use of Account 824 for storage service costs.  The Code of Regs description of the types of expenses to be included in each account is almost identical with the exception of the words ""storage"" and ""transmission system"", to wit,
""824 - Other expenses:  This account shall include the cost of labor, material used and expenses incurred in operating underground storage plant, and other underground storage operating expenses, not includible in any of the foregoing accounts, including research, development, and demonstration expenses.""
""859 - Other expenses:  This account shall include the cost of labor, material used and expenses incurred in operating transmission system equipment and other transmission system expenses not includible in any of the foregoing accounts, including research, development, and demonstration expenses.""

"RE: Hartley IA TBS #1","James,

As soon as we have a revised PPA invoice for October that we feel will be the final info, could you fax a copy to me.  The customer is waiting for some other data from me that uses SMS and DDVC amounts for the past year, and I cannot finish the info for him until we have this resolved.  I'd like to call him and give him an update.  Do you know approximately when we might have the revised PPA?

Thanks,

Joni

"Label to Buy Out Mariah Carey Contract","
[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE]	


     [IMAGE]LABEL TO BUY OUT MARIAH CAREY CONTRACT     [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]   It's been a rough year for Mariah Carey. The pop diva had an emotional and physical breakdown, and sales of her much-anticipated album Glitter were not as sparkly as expected.   As a result, Carey's record label is reportedly trying to buy out the rest of her contract. Carey signed a deal with EMI-Virgin records earlier in the year for a reported amount of between $80 million and $118 million -- depending on whether she produced four or five albums for the label.   Another reported term of the deal between Carey and Virgin was that she receive a $20 million advance for each album, $6 million for production of music videos and $1.5 million to promote four singles.   However, Glitter was released at the wrong time -- on September 11 -- and sold only 2 million copies worldwide. EMI-Virgin reportedly lost $10 million in the process.   Now it is being reported that the label is looking to buy out the rest of Carey's contract, offering to pay the singer a one-time lump sum, hoping to dissolve the previous deal.  [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]MARISA TOMEI SAYS CAT IS PSYCHIC    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] MARISA TOMEI  According to the New York Post's PageSix column, Marisa Tomei says her cat is psychic.

Tomei says that not only did the kitty wake her up -- but led her to the television, adding that the cat ""was telling me to get up and turn on the TV.""   Tomei is nominated for her performance in ""In the Bedroom.""

"ETS and Corporate Change Control","The following item was presented in this week's corporate change control....

Dec. 28
Beginning at 5:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will remove domain controllers CORPHOU-DCARD02 and CORPHOU-DCARD03 from service to be rebuilt.  These are just two of the numerous active domain controllers within the Corp domain.  There should be no disruption of service as user requests should automatically be redirected to an active domain controller.  Once these servers are rebuilt, they will be returned to the Corp domain.

Dec. 31
From 8:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., the Corporate server team will move ECTHOU-HR1 to the Ardmore data center.  This move will result in a total disruption of service for those HR users whose S:\ drive is mapped to this server.

Jan. 7
From 7:00 a.m. through 1/11 at 5:00 p.m., Facilities will perform the annual maintenance on the rooftop chillers.  The chillers will be taken down one at a time during the maintenance.  No impact to ETS is expected.

"RE: SBA Contracts","Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on
the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on
Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on
monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with
Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review
procedures for any changes.

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough
to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance
from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could
reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will
review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious
to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of
This email.

Thanks Lynn

I received a call today from the CMS Beaver plant and they have shut their process plant down due to gas prices. They do not know at this time  when they will start back processing . This is the same thing that happen last December. They have assured us that the gas that they are delivering to us is going through a Dehy and a mole sieve to knock any water out. The BTU of the gas received on the C-line will be running around 1150 BTU. We will need to keep a close watch on the C-line suction water content during this time. This is the first call I have received about a processing plant shutting down due to price this month.

"All tests were NOT successfully executed","
All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

"RE: SBA Contracts","	Thanks all - I'm sorry for all the confusion.  Reyna - I will call you next week.  I just have a couple questions.  Thanks again.  I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving.  MW

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

I am not sure I understand the question.  Do you mean at anytime we call on SBA volumes, we never/should not allocate the location?

Subject:	RE: SBA Contracts

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

Yes, you are correct. The changes in the business requirements for the scheduling priority of SBA contracts will not impact NNG's primary firm shippers. What do you need to verify and support this fact?

     [IMAGE]NAUGHTY NICOLE IS GETTING NAUGHTIER  [IMAGE]Romance with bad-boy pop star heats up      [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] NICOLE KIDMAN   Nicole Kidman is getting even with her ex-hubby Tom Cruise for flaunting his love affair with Penelope Cruz - by cavorting with Brit pop bad-boy Robbie Williams!   Nicole and Robbie, 27 - who shot to stardom in the mid-1990s as part of the band Take That - first set tongues wagging this past September when they teamed up on a duet of 'Somethin' Stupid,' a remake of the 1967 hit by Frank Sinatra and his daughter Nancy.   And the pair ""really turned up the heat on romance rumors in mid-October when Robbie sneaked into the Dorchester Hotel in London to pay a late-night visit to the red-haired siren after she did a talk-show taping,"" an insider revealed.    ""Robbie didn't emerge from the hotel until 3 a.m., looking ruffled and smiling.   ""Then the twosome reportedly spent the night together following his Royal Albert Hall concert, secretly meeting at a casino before continuing their tryst elsewhere.   ""After that, the couple spent seven hours locked in a London studio filming a sexy video to promote the 'Somethin' Stupid' single, in which they trade steamy kisses.""   Later in the torrid video - which has created a big stir in the British press - Nicole brandishes a whip and ends up wearing little more than a diamond necklace and a strategically placed purse.   ""Most recently, the pair spent two hours alone at Sydney's posh Establishment Hotel following his concert there,"" said the insider.   ""Then he followed Nicole back to her Darling Point home. And the following day, Robbie was a guest on Nicole's yacht anchored in Sydney Harbor.   ""Nicole and Robbie are really smitten with each other.""   When asked what it was like to make beautiful music with the swaggering singer, Nicole, 34, responded coyly to a reporter: ""Call it chemistry, if you like.""   For his part, Robbie took a swipe at Nicole's diminutive ex when he told the reporter: ""I was amazed at how well our voices worked. I think the fact that we're the same height really helped, too!""   Said the insider:    ""By her outrageous behavior with Robbie, Nicole is sending a clear message to Cruise - two can play at this game.""

Subject:	Marketer for Post Rock Gas

Joni, I was wondering if you could find out for me who the Marketer is for Post Rock Gas.  The reason I would like to know is they are the last hold-out shipper as far as signing their extension agreement so that we can send them their Rate Case Refund invoices which are dated September 1, 1999.  I would like to see if a Marketer could call them to see if we could get them to sign so that we could finally get the last of these invoices sent out and cleared from our accounts receivable account.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Raetta

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to ""schedule"" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Jean:  I went through the configuration in the PBX out at the Aviation hangar and it should meet your needs with its current configuration.  I have enough spare ports to support up to 50 phones.  They also have their own voicemail system. We would however, have to provide the phones, but we should have enough in stock to prevent us from having to order more.  As mentioned in my voicemail, it is a completely stand alone system that does not require the downtown site to be operational.  If you guys decide to go this route, we will also have to look at the cabling out there to make sure that it would meet your needs.  I know at one time they had looked at making that a disaster recovery site for Enron, so I believe that is why it is sized the way it is.  Let me know if you have additional questions.  Thanks!

Courtney - Clarification on .... (They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?)      Are you referring to people in Market Services and if so, what level are they?  Martha

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker

     [IMAGE]POUNDSTONE BACK ON COMEDY CIRCUIT     [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] PAULA POUNDSTONE   Paula Poundstone is back on the comedy track after a stint in jail and drug rehab. She completed a court-ordered 180-day stay at a live-in rehab facility, and is currently on track for a comeback.   The 41-year-old comedienne performed at the Rio Theatre in Santa Cruz, California last Friday, poking fun at herself and her situation in classic Poundstone style.   ""It's kind of strange to see this many seats not in a circle,"" she joked, alluding to the time she spent at the Promises rehabilitation facility in Malibu.    ""This is my first night performing since I've been a criminal,"" said Poundstone. ""Jail is just like the cop shows. I got one phone call, and I called Dick Van Dyke.""   Poundstone pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment and a misdemeanor charge of inflicting injury on a child on September 12. Three counts of lewd acts upon a child were dropped by prosecutors in return for the plea.   According to Poundstone's attorney, she will be allowed monitored visitation with her three adopted children until a decision is made in family court.

Brooks filed papers in a Davidson County, Tennessee Circuit Court in November 2000, citing irreconcilable differences.   Brooks' spokeswoman Karen Byrd had no additional comment other than to confirm the report.   The couple have three daughters aged 8, 6 and 4 and have homes in Tennessee as well as Oklahoma.

I've checked the ISC about the inability to view pay information via eHRonline this morning.  They are having a problem with the electronic pay advice function.  The recorded message says that there will be resolution to the problem by noon.  It did not mention anything about those receiving a paper copy of their pay advice so I'm assuming (not always a good idea) that those will come in the morning mail run.  I'll check later and try to get an update for you.

Crude Oil Futures Rise Ahead of Extended Holiday Weekend

    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.34
to $19.62 per barrel on Friday as the market traded on short-term
technicals. Traders were squaring their books before the long
Christmas hokiday. Expectations that OPEC would finally move ahead
with a plan to remove 2 million bpd from the world market likely gave
the pre-holiday market a boost. The cartel has agreed to chop 1.5
million bpd from production if non-OPEC producers remove an
additional 500,000 bpd between them. Last week, Omans raised its
pledge to trim output from 25,000 to 40,000 bpd, which leaves the
cartel only 37,500 bpd short of its goal. OPEC ministers plan to meet
in Cairo on December 28th to weigh their options, but insiders say
the cartel will move ahead with their plans, despite the relatively
small shortfall. Petroleum inventories are 50 million barrels higher
than a year ago, after a slumping economy whittled away at demand.
But gasoline and heating oil stockpiles unexpectedly fell for the
week ended December 14th and crude inventories rose less than
predicted. The EIA said that the national average retail price for
gasoline has fallen $0.036 to $1.06 per gallon, down $0.36 from a
year ago. Gasoline futures for January delivery on the NYMEX climbed
$0.0083 to $0.5586 per gallon. January heating oil futures on the
NYMEX rose $0.0035 to $0.5484 per gallon after forecasts that
temperatures in the Northeast would be near or below normal over the
Christmas season. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February
delivery on the IPE were up $0.23 to $19.36 per barrel.

Bad Weather in Russia Lowers Oil Exports


    Russia is set to announce crude exports in the 4th quarter were
almost 150,000 bpd below what was planned due to bad weather. The
fall, equal to what OPEC asked Russia to cut in exports in the 1st
quarter of 2002, would be down from an initial 4th quarter schedule
of 2.88 million bpd for Russian and transit oil. The 4th quarter
figures will be released in early January. Predictions are that
Russia will be short by 145,000  160,000 bpd if the weather does not
take a turn for the worse. Third quarter exports came in around 3
million bpd. Russia committed to trim exports by 150,000 bpd as part
of OPEC's plan to have non-members contribute 500,000 bpd in export
reductions before the cartel would lower its production by 1.5
million bpd. Removal of the oil from the global market is aimed at
lifting prices which have tumbled as an economic downturn has eaten
away at demand. But, Russian oil exports were already hard hit by
inclement weather in November when the key ports of Novorossiisk and
Tuapse in Russia, Odessa in Ukraine and Ventspils in Latvia were
closed for a total of 25 days. In December, Novorossiisk was shut-
down for over 10 days, while Lithuanian terminal Butinge was closed
the entire month because of an oil leak. Russian crude output and
export schedules are established every quarter and spread among the
country's oil firms. OPEC has asked Russia to explain the statistics
of its promised 1st quarter cut before the cartel meets on December
28 in Cairo to set its own final reduction. Those close to the
situation have reported that Russia will set exports at 2.6 million
bpd, or about 144,000 bpd lower than the 4th quarter. Lukoil said
that Russia needed to reduce output to prevent an already overloaded
pipeline system from breaking down.

Saudi Arabia and Oil Majors Negotiating Natural Gas Agreements

    Saudi Arabia and 8 international oil companies, which are
negotiating large natural gas investments in the country, have said
that they expect to sign executive agreements by next March. The
agreements center around 3 multi-billion dollar projects in the Saudi
natural gas sector. ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell will take the
lead in the kingdom's natural gas initiative. ExxonMobil has the lead
role in the $15 billion South Ghawar development, core venture one,
which includes Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and Phillips. ExxonMovil will
also lead the $5 billion Red Sea development, core venture 2, which
includes Occidental and Marathon. Royal Dutch/Shell has the leading
role in the $5 billion Shaybah development, core venture three, with
Conoco and TotalFinaElf. The natural gas initiative is expected to
boost the Saudi economy and create jobs. The kingdom's natural gas
upstream has been off-limits to foreign companies for the past 25
years.

EIA 2002 Energy Outlook

    Average world oil prices will gradually move higher from 2002
through the year 2020 as demand rises by 56%, according to the EIA in
its Annual Energy Outlook 2002 report, but natural gas and
electricity prices will likely fall. The EIA expects world oil demand
to rise to 118.9 million bpd in 2020. World demand stood at 76
million bpd seen in 2000. World oil prices will also average $22.48 a
barrel in 2001, down from $27.72 in 2000, before starting a gradual
increase after 2002, the report predicted. The price in 2020 will
reach $24.68 per barrel, largely due to higher projected world
demand. The EIA also forecasted that OPEC oil production will reach
57.5 million bpd in 2020, almost twice the 30.9 million bpd produced
last year. Average wellhead prices for natural gas will likely be at
$4 per Mcf in 2001, up from $3.60 in 2000, but then decline sharply
by 2020, the EIA report said. It predicted a price of $3.26 per Mcf
for 2020, even though demand that year will likely be 1 Tcf lower
than was projected in 2001, because of a less optimistic assessment
of natural gas reserves discovered by exploratory drilling.
Electricity prices are also predicted to decline to $0.065 per kWh in
2020, down from $0.069 in 2000. But the new 2020 price level is
higher than the $0.061 projected last year because of higher than
previously expected electricity demand. The accuracy of 20-year
forecast is not only severely limited but also does not account for
the volatility during the period. To see the full report, please go

Shell and Gazprom in Russian Arctic Natural Gas Deal

    Russia's Gazprom is set to conclude a joint venture agreement
with Shell that will allow Shell to invest in a huge Arctic natural
gas field operated by Gazprom. The deal is supported by both Vladimir
Putin and Tony Blair. Gazprom brought the field onstream last October
in the polar region of Yamal-Nenets. The field, Zapolyarnoye, is the
world's 5th largest natural gas field. It holds 3 trillion cubic
meters and a life of at least 42 years.

Antitrust Lawsuit Reinstated Against Major Oil Companies

    An appeals court has strengthened the claims of a 1997 lawsuit
that alleges oil and petrochemical companies used shared salary
information to unlawfully keep workers' pay at artificially low
levels. The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower court
ruling dismissing the lawsuit, brought against 14 major companies
that employ about 80% - 90% percent of the industry's work force. The
defendants previously denied the allegations. The case was sent back
to the lower court for further proceedings. The lawsuit was brought
by a former Exxon worker on behalf of herself and other Exxon
employees alleging the companies violated federal antitrust law by
regularly sharing detailed information about compensation paid to
nonunion managerial, professional and technical employees agreeing
that they would use the data to set salaries. In addition to Exxon,
the other defendants include: Mobil, Texaco and Chevron.

We will be giving you a list Tuesday morning that will show all of the shippers that we sent Reservation invoices to on December 3.  Do not call them until we get that list to you.  We would like for you to highlight the shippers that you have called and then return the lists to us.  This will help us to ensure that everyone has been called.

Please note:  If your shipper currently knows our Lock Box number because they send checks, please be sure that you call these folks because we cannot let them use the Lock Box.  They can still send a check in, but they will need to send it to the P.O. Box 1188 for this building.  If possible, give them your room location so that it can come directly to you.  If you have any questions, please let either of us know.

"Outbound TMS Messages","With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called ""critical notices"" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.   

I do think we need to know the following:  

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?    
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?  

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

"RE: All tests were not completely successfully","The Help Desk did not receive calls on either of these items this morning.  That is positive and demonstrates that we have a process in place to resolve issues before a customer places a call.  

I do think it is important to know; 1.) how were these resolved?  2.) what caused them and how can they be avoided in the future?

All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

If it is rescheduled, it will probably be moved to December or January.

Sorry for the short notice, but Phil has been asked to meet with Dynegy on Thursday to give a presentation on ETS pipeline operations.  I would interpret that to be good news that Dynegy is still showing interest in our pipeline group.

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Frank, 

Accounting has indicated our October invoice has some DDVC and IT overrun charges that our metering does not show.  Before we can pay these, we would need you to verify the measurement of all of our stations.  Bill and his SCADA folks believe the untelemetered allocations are inaccurate, and likely causing the DDVC and overrun.  

I have asked our Accounting group to short pay the October DDVC's of $26,374; and to also short pay the associated transport invoice for the IT overrun of $29,704.52; a total disputed cost of $56.078.52.  

Let me know if you need any additional information, a brief recap of the disputed charges are shown below, 

Thanks, 

Tom

Subject:	Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20

Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Dynegy Confirms -3: Deal May Be Cut More Than 40% -WSJ

11/27/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Earlier Tuesday, a report in The Wall Street Journal quoted people familiar with the matter who said Enron and Dynegy were in advanced discussions to cut the price of the all-stock transaction by more than 40% to about $5 billion. Sousa, the Dynegy spokesman, didn't comment on the newspaper report. 
Dynegy shares recently traded at $40, up 75 cents, or 1.9%, while Enron shares changed hands at $3.94, down 7 cents, or 1.7%. 
Under the original terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or $10.78, for each share outstanding, or about $9.14 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
According to the Journal report, the new terms could be below 0.15 of a Dynegy share. 
The deal is critical for Enron, which also simultaneously carrying out talks to receive between $500 million to $1 billion in additional funding to support its operations, while carrying on negotiations to restructure its debt, which totals about $13 billion. 
While Dynegy has already provided Enron with a cash infusion, it is uncertain how long Enron's current funds will allow it to remain solvent. 
Meanwhile, a third employee lawsuit has been filed against Enron over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of Enron's stock, which has declined more than 90% in the trailing 12 months. The suit claims Enron ""locked down"" the plan, which prevented employees from being able to sell the shares, and seeks $850 million for plan losses. 
Although the other recently filed employee suits didn't disclose the amount of compensation the plaintiffs are seeking, it is possible the suits seek a similar level of damages, a CreditSights report said. 
If this is true, the CreditSights report said, it is possible the clause that allows Dynegy to walk away from the deal if the liabilities from ""pending""' or ""threatened"" litigation may exceed $3.5 billion may be invoked. 
In addition, to the employee lawsuits, more than a dozen shareholder suits have been filed against Enron.

Enron Fights To Find Near-Term Sellers, But Still Trading
By Mark Golden
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

11/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) continued to struggle Tuesday to find willing sellers of near-term gas and power in North America, but the one-time market maker was still able to trade on a limited basis, according to market sources. 
""It's not getting any better,"" said one major energy broker.
Many energy trading companies aren't selling to Enron and are only buying from it near-term. These include Aquila Inc. (ILA), Mirant (MIR), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD) subsidiary Coral Energy, Sempra Energy (SRE), and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's energy trading subsidiary, said the broker. The broker estimated Enron's over-the-counter trading volume to be about 25% of what it was a month ago. Companies are willing to buy from Enron in the spot gas and power markets, because taking delivery on commodity and paying for it a month later poses no credit risk for the buyer. 
Some other companies, like Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Duke Energy Corp. (DUK) and BP PLC. (BP), continue to trade with Enron fairly freely, the broker said. Dynegy has reached an agreement to acquire Enron, though the terms of that deal are being renegotiated. The trading subsidiaries of troubled California utility-holding companies PG&E Corp. (PCG) and Edison International (EIX) also are trading with Enron. 
The third and largest group of companies are trading with Enron on a very limited basis to reduce exposure by taking off-setting trades against deals done long ago. These include El Paso Corp. (EPG), Reliant Resources (RRI), Tractebel SA's (B.TRB) U.S. trading unit and regulated utilities, the broker said. 
Several energy traders said that both power and gas were being sold at prices lower than Enron was offering. 
""They've been cut off from so many people,"" said one electricity trader. 
Enron Says Just Slight Reduction In Transactions 

An Enron spokesman said he has seen a slight reduction in transactions but not to 25% of the one-month-ago level. 
The notional value of Enron's 30-day rolling average of transactions is $2.8 billion, said Enron spokesman Eric Thode. Thode declined to give volume data for Tuesday or Monday, although the company was giving daily information two weeks ago. 
""We're not doing daily information. We're only speaking in terms of 30-day rolling averages. ... It's not fair to speak in terms of daily because of daily volatility,"" Thode said. 
Traders and brokers said they hope Dynegy will offer some kind of guarantee to Enron's trading to restore confidence. But, after Enron's ability to transact took a severe turn for the worse Nov. 20, Dynegy said that the companies must continue to operate independently until their merger is approved and completed. 
Energy companies began shying away from Enron over the past month, as concerns about its finances precipitated a 75% drop in its stock price and left its bonds trading at levels typically associated with junk-rated debt. 
But Enron saw its ability to trade seriously damaged last week following the late release of its quarterly financial report with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. For the first time since Enron's troubles began a month ago, energy companies stopped selling to Enron in the spot markets for fear that Enron might not be able to pay its bills as soon as next month based on the quarterly filing. 
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's all rate Enron one notch above speculative grade. Moody's has Enron's ratings on review for a downgrade, and S&P has Enron on negative credit watch. Fitch calls Enron's credit rating ""evolving."" Enron's ability to do business in the energy markets depends on its maintaining investment-grade ratings.

SMARTMONEY.COM: Common Sense: Joining The Deal Dance
By James B. Stewart

11/27/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of SMARTMONEY.COM 
   
I KNOW IT'S been hard, but if you've been able to divert yourself from the amazing news out of Afghanistan this past week, you may have noticed some important merger stories: trouble in the Compaq Computer (CPQ)- Hewlett-Packard (HWP) deal, Dynegy's (DYN) bid for Enron (ENE), and, on Monday, the announcement of Phillips Petroleum's (P) proposed merger with Conoco (COC) to create the world's sixth-largest oil company. 
The Phillips-Conoco merger is an excellent example of what economists call horizontal integration - the merger of two companies in the same business, in this case, oil and gas. As an investor, I love these combinations, even though as a citizen I'm often troubled by antitrust concerns. Investors who engage in what's called merger arbitrage, or risk arbitrage, which gained fame and notoriety in the 1980s, tend to sell stock in the acquiring company, and buy the stock of the company being acquired. Though they're far less conspicuous now, risk arbitrageurs play a prominent role in many hedge funds. The strategy is appealing to many portfolio managers because returns are determined less by overall movement in the market than by the circumstances of particular deals. Successful risk-arbitrage hedge funds typically earn 12% to 20% a year in good markets and bad. 
Individual investors can do some risk arbitrage of their own, simply by buying stock in a company being acquired and hoping the deal goes through. Because of the risk that it won't (either because of regulatory hurdles or market reaction), these stocks usually trade at a discount to the acquisition price. But few investors are willing to commit the time and resources to keep up with every twist in these deals, let alone investing in enough of them to have a reasonably diversified portfolio. I know I don't. 
Instead, for long-term investors I often recommend buying the stock of the acquiring company. In this latest instance, that would be Phillips. In similar circumstances, I have had good luck buying Exxon after it launched its bid for Mobil to form Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Chevron after it acquired Texaco to become ChevronTexaco (CVX). Their stocks were down on the news, but later recovered handsomely as they began to benefit from cost-cutting and economies of scale, not to mention reduced competition. Even if the deal fails, you aren't stuck owning a stock that was bid up only because a deal was announced. Honeywell (HON) investors will know only too well what I mean. I still consider it outrageous that the European Community blocked General Electric's (GE) acquisition of Honeywell, but when the deal fell through, GE investors were glad they had bought the acquiring company rather than the target. 
So far, the Phillips-Conoco deal is unusual in that both stocks rose slightly after the merger was announced, which suggests that other investors have caught on to the same phenomenon I've noticed. But even without a built-in merger premium, I'm enthusiastic about the energy sector. True, oil stocks have dropped further since I last recommended them, before the calamitous events of Sept. 11. With talk of an out-and-out price war breaking out and dire predictions of $10-a-barrel oil, it's no wonder. But it's exactly when prospects in the oil patch look their worst that it's the time to buy these stocks. If there is indeed a global economic recovery next year, as seems ever more likely, oil prices will rise. So I recommend Phillips both as a merger play and as a timely investment in the energy sector. 
Which brings me to Enron. I'm glad I warned readers away from this former highflying natural-gas, pipeline and energy-trading concern, since its stock continued to fall precipitously until the takeover bid emerged from Dynegy. This isn't exactly a horizontal merger, since Dynegy isn't a big factor in energy trading, but it will combine the two companies' pipelines and natural-gas holdings. The market reaction to this deal was very unusual, since shares of Dynegy, the acquiring company, jumped 14% on the news. Enron moved up just 7%. This is the opposite of what's supposed to happen, but then, nothing about Enron has been typical. The market seems to be saying that it likes the deal, but doubts it will go through, a prospect enhanced by the large breakup fee Dynegy will enjoy if it's horrified by what it discovers in Enron's still-mysterious books. Personally, I'm sitting this one out, but there may be an arbitrage opportunity in Enron for risk-tolerant investors. If the deal goes through (and I think it will), Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 share of Dynegy for each share of Enron. That's worth over $11 a share at current prices, yet Enron closed Tuesday at just $7, down 23% after a warning from the company that its falling credit ratings are starting to rattle its financial structure. So while Enron's position is becoming increasingly precarious, this deal could make for a nice return. And it's still potentially a very good bet for Dynegy - one that will add to its natural-gas reserves and vault it into the front ranks of energy traders, assuming it can hold on to Enron's talented but now disgruntled employees. Finally, there's the spectacle of the founding Hewlett and Packard families turning against H-P's proposed acquisition of Compaq on the grounds that proposed economies of scale - read layoffs - run counter to the spirit of the company's founders, who treasured employee loyalty and apparently never fired anyone except for cause. The dissidents acknowledged that they have little or no business and managerial experience themselves, although they are represented on H-P's board. Forgive me if I seem impatient with these beneficiaries of extravagant wealth and trust funds, but this reasoning is absurd. However much we might sympathize with their concern for employee well-being, the directors of a modern corporation must balance employees' needs with those of other constituencies, especially the shareholders. Otherwise, a company will suffer far more dire consequences, including bankruptcy or a forced sale in which far more people will lose their jobs than in any merger-related layoffs. I have already expressed my muted enthusiasm for the proposed H-P-Compaq merger. That the deal was even proposed is a sad commentary on how far the fortunes of these once-great companies have fallen. That said, the merger still makes sense, and it's far better for shareholders than if the companies are forced to continue in their respective downward spirals. I owned both stocks until last week, when I sold my small position in Compaq. I did this primarily to realize a tax loss (more on tax-loss selling next week), but also because I wouldn't want to own it if the deal falls through. I'm holding on to my larger position in H-P. I think the deal will be completed, despite the melodrama of family opposition. Eventually, I believe both stocks will benefit, and patient investors might want to buy one or both companies on any weakness. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---- Reasons for Thankfulness The stunning success of the Northern Alliance and the American military mission in Afghanistan has been an amazing story this past week. Who will soon forget the accounts of newly liberated Afghans digging up their TV sets, casting off their veils and celebrating their freedom from Taliban oppression? The implications of this success are profound, and in my view, extremely positive. Economists are already scaling back their estimates for total cost of this war. Oil prices are plunging. The effect is that of a significant tax cut, and just when the economy needs it. The capture of Osama bin Laden seems only a matter of time, which means the world may soon be a safer place. The promise of greater stability in the Middle East has never seemed more tantalizing. 
Is it a paradox that as a calamitous 2001 nears an end, I feel more thankful than I have in years filled with a far greater bounty of peace and prosperity? Perhaps not. I hope this Thanksgiving brings you hope, joy and gratitude for the many blessings that have been bestowed upon us, and that have survived and even flourished in the wake of tragedy.

STOCKWATCH Enron slightly higher on hopes for new deal price

11/27/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd
NEW YORK (AFX) - Shares of Enron Corp were slightly higher in midsession trade on reports that the company is trying to renegotiate the terms of a deal with Dynegy Inc, by cutting the price of the all-stock transaction to 5 bln usd, or 40 pct, from 9 bln usd, dealers said. 
At 12.19 pm, amid broad declines in the market, Enron shares were trading up 5 cents at 4.04 usd. Dynegy was up 1.26 usd, or 3.26 pct, at 40.51.
The DJIA was down 111.48 points at 9,871.28. The S&P 500 was down 10.40 points at 1,147.02. The Nasdaq composite was down 20.25 points at 1,920.98. 
Earlier, the Wall Street Journal said Enron was in advanced talks with Dynegy in an attempt to salvage their two week-old acquisition deal. The companies are discussing a new price for the all-paper deal, following the sharp fall in Enron's share price of the past few weeks. 
Enron had hoped to finalise the deal and make an announcement yesterday that would calm investors -- the shares are trading at a small fraction of their record high last year of 87.50 usd. 
As of today, however, the revised deal still has not been formalised. 
The current agreement with Dynegy contains a ""material adverse change"" clause, which could be invoked to call the deal off. 
As part of its due diligence, Dynegy is examining details of Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, which reportedly contained information it had not received previously. 
""Enron is a black hole, and I don't know how deep the bottom is,"" said Fadel Gheit an analyst at Fahnestock & Co. 
Only four weeks ago, Enron's stock was trading at the 8 usd mark, Gheit said, noting that if the Dynegy had done their homework the stock would not have continued to collapse. 
""The market sees this and somebody has to figure out the potential exposure, it could be several billion dollars,"" said Gheit. 
If the deal is to go through then the two companies must arrive at a new stock-exchange ratio, said Gheit. Under the current acquisition agreement, Dynegy would exchange 0.2685 share for each Enron share tendered. 
According to the Wall Street Journal, the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock, which would value Enron at less than 6 usd a share, or about 5 bln usd.

IN THE MONEY: Hedge Funds Say Yes To New Enron Terms
By Carol S. Remond

11/27/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- News that Enron Corp. (ENE) and would-be suitor and savior Dynegy Inc. (DYN) are working to renegotiate their merger agreement has done little to assuage market jitters about Enron's fate.
And so far, even professional arbitrageurs, who normally thrive on placing bets on whether a merger is going to go through, continue for the most part to stay clear of Enron's stock and bonds because of the uncertainty surrounding the once mighty energy trader. 
Still, reports that the equity swap ratio offered by Dynegy could be revised down to below 0.15 from 0.2685, has some hedge funds, often willing to take more risks, looking to place trades on the deal. 
""We're trying to figure out a good play,"" said a trader at a New York hedge fund. 
So far, bets under consideration seem to be those that would include a combination of stock and debt trading, somehow hedging a short position on Enron's shares with a long position in some of its bonds. 
""People that are playing the debt are definitely playing the stock against it,"" a hedge fund manager at another fund said. This manager added, ""We're still trying to evaluate different risk/reward scenario on the debt and equity sides."" 
Investors that sell stock short borrow shares in the hopes of replacing them later by purchasing them at a lower price. 
Arbitrageurs typically sell short shares of the acquirer, while taking long positions in the stock of the target company. But there is nothing typical about Enron's financial woes and the rescue efforts launched by Dynegy and large banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
Traders reported increased activity in the still mostly illiquid Enron debt market. ""Some bids are coming in, especially on the lower priced bonds,"" said a trader at a large New York investment bank that makes a market in Enron's bonds. 
Enron bonds, which had fallen in value in recent weeks, gained five to seven points early Tuesday as investors continue to await confirmation from Enron and Dynegy that their merger deal remains on track, albeit at a lower price. Enron's 6.4% bonds due 2004 were recently trading at about 55 cents on the dollar, up from 48 cents Monday. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron holders would have gotten 0.2685 of Dynegy shares for each of their Enron shares. Quoting people close to the discussions, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the new ratio is expected to be less than 0.15 share of Dynegy stock for every share of Enron stock. That lower exchange was also mentioned in a Dow Jones Newswires story last Friday. At current prices a 0.15 exchange ratio would value Enron at less than $6 a share. 
Essentially this new value, if true, means that it has now become easier for hedge funds and other risk takers to play the merger odds. 
When a hedge fund shorting Enron stock at $4 a share risked losing more than $6 if the merger went through at the 0.2685 ratio, it now stands to lose only $2 a share (based on the $6 value of Enron stock under the new 0.15 ratio). At the same time it has become much easier to hedge that loss potential by going long on Enron bonds. If the merger doesn't happen, Enron is seen by many as heading for bankruptcy with an ultimate share value of 0. That means that hedge funds shorting Enron at $4 stand to benefit by that amount. 
Hedge fund managers and traders said that current thinking puts the value of Enron bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar if the merger fails and about 80 cents on the dollar if it goes through. Meanwhile, the value of Enron stock is capped at about $6 a share if the merger goes through with a new conversion ratio of 0.15. 
""A lot of the guys are still very skeptical,"" said a bond trader at a New York bank. ""But this is really making the hedge trade easier and we've seen more customers short the stock and buy the bonds."" 
Still, this type of bets isn't for the faint of heart, and most investors are likely to wait for more news before taking a position. 
""We're nibbling a little bit at the bonds right now. But the situation is so volatile that it's difficult to be aggressive,"" the manager of a large New York hedge fund said.

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says
2001-11-27 16:12 (New York)

Enron Credit Rating to Remain Unchanged for Today, Moody's Says

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating
will remain at ``Baa3,'' the lowest investment grade, by Moody's
Investors Service, which said it won't take any ratings action
today on the largest energy trading company.

     David Stimpson, Moody's managing director for ratings
communication, said although there was speculation in the market
that Moody's would make a ratings change, the company won't take
any action on Enron today. Stimpson declined further comment.

     Moody's had been expected to make a statement on Enron's
credit as bankers sought to raise as much as $2 billion for the
energy trader in private equity.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.



Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

Enron Turned Down by Investors Alwaleed, Blackstone, Carlyle

     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s bankers,
seeking to raise as much as $2 billion for the energy trader, have
been turned down by investors including Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal,
the Carlyle Group Inc. and Blackstone Group LP.

     ``I was approached by several people to invest in the
company, but we declined,'' said Alwaleed, a billionaire investor
from Saudi Arabia. The fall in Enron's shares, which have declined
95 percent this year, didn't necessarily make it a good
investment, he said.

     Bankers led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Vice Chairman James B.
Lee have been unable for two weeks to raise the money because of
concern Enron won't be able to meet its obligations. That concern
was heightened after Enron disclosed a $690 million payment due
this week. Enron needs the money to operate as it completes an
acquisition by Dynegy Inc.

     The prospect that Enron will fail to line up financing,
jeopardizing its plan to be acquired by Dynegy, has weighed on its
stock and bonds. The company's securities gained today as talks
between Enron and Dynegy to renegotiate terms of the transaction
convinced some investors the takeover was more likely to take
place.

     Enron 6.4 percent bonds that mature in 2006, which closed
yesterday at 48 cents on the dollar, rebounded to trade at about
55 cents on the dollar. At that price, the bonds yield 22.5
percent. Enron shares rose 21 cents, or 5 percent, to $4.22. The
stock finished yesterday at $4.01, its lowest level in 14 years.

                        Declining to Invest

     J.P. Morgan and Citigroup Inc., Enron's largest lenders, plan
to provide $250 million to Enron each as part of a $2 billion
package. The bankers have been seeking additional investments,
which would be made in the form of convertible stock, for more
than two weeks.

     Questor Management Co., a $1 billion private-equity fund that
invests in troubled companies, and buyout funds such as Carlyle
Group and Blackstone have balked at investing, said people
familiar with the situation. Blackstone and Questor declined to
comment. Christopher Ullman, a spokesman for Carlyle, said: ``We
are not in discussions with Enron about financing.''

   ``More equity would leave Enron with a stronger balance sheet,
which should reassure their trading partners,'' said Kathleen
Vuchetich, who helps manage $1.4 billion in assets at the Strong
American Utilities Fund. Vuchetich has 4.2 percent of her
portfolio invested in Dynegy shares.

     Enron and Dynegy discussed revising the terms of their merger
over the weekend, said Steve Stengel, spokesman for Dynegy. Dynegy
is now talking about paying less than 0.15 share for each of
Enron's, valuing the company's equity at about $5 billion, or less
than $6 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people
close to the discussions.

                               Terms

     ``The concern is that the Dynegy deal breaks down,'' said
Paul Tice, co-head of U.S. high-grade credit research who covers
the energy market for Deutsche Bank.

     Current terms call for an exchange ratio of 0.2685 share of
Dynegy stock for each Enron share. Given recent disclosures about
Enron's debt and the drop in the stock price, a fairer ratio would
be 0.15 share of Dynegy, said Ronald Barone, a UBS Warburg analyst
who rates Dynegy a ``strong buy.''

    Under current terms, the deal makes sense for Dynegy only if
Enron earns 85 cents or more next year, said Gordon Howald, an
analyst at Credit Lyonnais who rates Dynegy a ``buy.'' UBS
Warburg's Barone has reduced his estimate of Enron's 2002 earnings
to 75 cents a share from $1.65.

     Enron needs an infusion in part because it has $9 billion of
payments due before the end of 2002 and less than $2 billion in
cash and credit lines. The decline in reserves has also raised the
prospect that Moody's Investors Service may cut Enron's credit
rating. A lower rating would trigger $3.9 billion in debt
repayments for two affiliated partnerships.

                           Cash Question

     ``The main question is: `What is the cash position right
now?''' said Tice at Deutsche Bank. ``Is the falloff in the cash
position of the company stabilizing or not?''

     Moody's hasn't issued a report on Enron since the company
filed a quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange
Commission last week announcing it had a $690 million note due
this week. On Wednesday, Enron got a three-week reprieve from
lenders on the $690 million note and closed on a $450 million
credit line. Dynegy Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said he
was ``encouraged'' by the developments.



Liberty Funds Analyst Paik Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:56 (New York)


     Boston, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Edward Paik, an analyst at
Liberty Funds Group, comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion acquisition of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Paik has Enron shares among the $3.6 billion in assets he
helps manage at Liberty.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday.

     ``The stock market is clearly 100 percent certain the Dynegy
deal won't go through as negotiated,'' Paik said. ``We're just
waiting.''

     ``If they announce they've renegotiated the deal, it will be
implicit that due diligence has been done, and that Dynegy won't
walk away for anything that's happened up until now. If they were
to impose more conditions, what good is that? Dynegy needs to
resuscitate Enron back to health.''



A.G. Edwards Analyst Heim Comments on Dynegy and Enron Talks
2001-11-27 11:00 (New York)


     St. Louis, Missouri, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A.G. Edwards &
Sons Inc. analyst Michael Heim comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Heim rates Enron ``sell'' and Dynegy ``hold'' and
doesn't own shares of either company.

     The market is waiting for confirmation and details of a
renegotiated bid, Heim said.

     ``We'd need to know why they'd agreed to a new price,'' Heim
said. ``It also needs to be combined with some sort of shoring up
of Enron's trading business, which needs to be stabilized for the
deal to have real value.''



Commerzbank Analyst Meade Comments on Dynegy's Talks With Enron
2001-11-27 10:42 (New York)


     New York, Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Commerzbank Securities
analyst Andre Meade comments on Dynegy Inc.'s proposed
$23 billion buyout of Enron Corp., the largest energy trader.

     Dynegy may renegotiate terms of its bid for Enron, people
familiar with talks between the Houston-based companies said
yesterday. Meade rates both companies ``hold'' and owns no shares.

     ``If they are renegotiating, it confirms our fears that
Enron's crown jewel, its marketing and trading business, is
deteriorating,''

      Investors are waiting for a sign on the state of the
business, Meade said.

      Enron's trading business was worth more than $10 billion
before partners began shunning it on credit concerns, Meade said.
A lower price struck by Dynegy may reveal how much business has
fallen, and whether Dynegy believes Enron can regain it, Meade
said.

     A New York Times report that banks may extend payments on
some loans until after Dynegy purchases Enron ``raises concern
that Dynegy will be hurt by taking on the vast liabilities of
Enron,'' Meade said.



ENRON SHARES RECOVER FROM A.M. SLUMP
By Lisa Sanders
CBS.MarketWatch.com

4:10 PM ET Nov 27, 2001

HOUSTON (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Enron recovered from the morning's sub-$4
a share level Tuesday amid reports that the embattled energy merchant is
working with Dynegy to renegotiate its takeover offer.

Enron (ENE), which once hit $84.88 during the last holiday season,
added 13 cents to close at $4.14 on volume of 68.4 million shares. The
stock was the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange
Tuesday.

Dynegy shares added $1.64 to close at $40.89.

The New York Times reported that Houston-based Dynegy (DYN) and Enron
are renegotiating Dynegy's bid, once valued at $9 billion in stock.
According to the report, Dynegy is worried that Enron's core business --
energy trading -- is deteriorating. See full story.

Getting it done
______________________________________________________________________

Glen Hilton, portfolio manager of the Montgomery New Power Fund, said
it's a ""crapshoot"" as to whether the deal gets done.

""I think that regardless of the outcome Dynegy is still in a good
position for the long-term,"" he said. His fund liquidated its Enron
holdings completely in mid to late-October. ""Enron was the leader (in
energy trading), and it's clearly suffering so Dynegy is in a good shot
to take up the mantle.""

Hilton pointed to Enron's 10-Q, filed last Monday with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, and the falling share price as potential
triggers of the deal's material adverse affect clause. Those two things
could very well make Dynegy walk away from the merger. If that happens,
Hilton said, an Enron bankruptcy is a very real possibility.

""Very few companies understand what Enron does and Dynegy is one of the
few that could make something out of it,"" Hilton said. ""If Dynegy can
restore confidence in Enron's trading business and get Northern Natural
Gas, it looks like it might be worth the headache.""

Dynegy has the rights to Enron's Northern Natural Gas, a pipeline
system, whether the merger goes through or not.

Enron wasn't immediately available for comment. Dynegy, through a
company spokesman, confirmed that it was in discussions with ""the
parties involved in the transaction"" related to the structure of the
deal.




Top Of The News 
Enron In Free Fall 
Dan Ackman <javascript:newWindow('Ackman')>, Forbes.com <http://www.forbes.com/news>, 11.27.01, 9:00 AM ET 

NEW YORK - If not for Sept. 11, Enron would be a major scandal; as it stands, it's a minor scandal. The Houston-based energy company, whose Chairman Kenneth Lay is a personal friend of and top fundraiser for President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, is in free fall. The bailout by rival Dynegy made public three weeks ago appears to be unraveling. 

Dynegy's buyout of Enron was originally valued at $9 billion. But just as the deal was announced, Enron said its prior financial reporting was inaccurate and that it had overstated earnings by $586 million over the past four years. 

While the companies have not said the merger is off, investors don't believe it will happen, at least not at the stated price; they have bid Enron shares down to the point where the company has a market value of less than $3 billion. The shares closed yesterday at $4.01, down from $78 a year ago. 

The situation is in flux, as it has been for months. During that time, several top Enron executives have been forced to resign. Jeffrey Skilling, Enron's former chief executive officer, left in August for ""personal reasons."" 

Company officials said they hope to announce, perhaps as early as today, a series of changes: a lower price for the takeover; a cash infusion of $500 million; new, extended loan terms by Enron's bankers; and somehow, an agreement that prevents Dynegy from walking away in the face of litigation over Enron's devastated employee-retirement plan. Lawsuits by shareholders are sure to follow, considering Enron's restatement and the pay it lavished on executives, including Lay who received $135 million from salary, bonus and the exercise of stock options in 2000 alone. 

For now, Dynegy says it still wants to do a deal for its crosstown rival with 2000 revenue of $101 billion. 

Even more alarming than the deterioration in the share price is the crisis of confidence in Enron's reliability as a trading partner in worldwide energy markets. Last year, Enron was the dominant player in natural gas and electricity trading--a fast-paced, complex business quite removed from the company's history as a gas- and oil-pipeline builder and operator. The fear now is that other companies will refuse to trade with Enron out of trepidation that it will file for bankruptcy and not pay its bills. 

The company had $10.5 billion in debt as of its last annual report, and that number has likely grown by 20%. Already, credit agencies have cut their ratings on Enron debt. 

Dynegy and its partner, ChevronTexaco may pump billions of dollars into Enron's operations if the purchase goes through. But the deal will certainly undergo regulatory scrutiny and will take months to close. Investors and energy traders are increasingly doubtful that Enron can hang on by itself. 

Enron bills itself as one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. It says it ""markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world."" While all this may be true, its popularity with investors was based largely on its fast-growing revenue--much like the Internet companies whose collapse it mirrors. 

Few shareholders had any understanding of what Enron did to generate that revenue, and indeed Enron's own auditors at Arthur Andersen were confused. Most of the revenue was generated from trading, but the company's shares sold as if it was still an industrial company and not a financial firm. 

Enron was famous for being famous. Before the start of the 2000 baseball season, it purchased the rights to have its name on Houston's new ballpark. By 2002, Enron Field may need a new name. 

The name Enron itself sounds like it has something to do with energy, but it means nothing. At the time the company was formed from the merger of InterNorth of Omaha and Houston Natural Gas, the idea was to call the company Enteron. But the namers then looked in the dictionary and found out that Enteron means ""intestines;"" they decided to drop the ""te"" in the middle and go with Enron. Soon Enron may be part of Dynegy, a much smaller company in terms of revenue. If the deal falls apart, it may want to go back to Enteron.


Merger Traders Wary Even If Enron, Dynegy Cut New Terms
By Christina Cheddar

11/27/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Even if Dynegy Inc. (DYN) revises the terms of its acquisition of Enron Corp. (ENE), some takeover traders say the stock remains too risky. 
Earlier Tuesday, a Dynegy spokesman confirmed the company was in talks to restructure the Enron acquisition. Separately, a person familiar with the negotiations said the talks are centered on creating a package that includes a lower exchange ratio for Enron shareholders, a provision for additional funding for Enron, and the refinancing of Enron's existing debt. 
Even with the boost Enron shares have received from the reports, they continue to trade at a sharp discount to the original deal's value. Enron shares recently traded at $4.30, up 29 cents, or 7.2%, while Dynegy shares changed hands at $41.50, up $2.25, or 5.8%. 
Under the original terms of the deal, Enron shareholders will receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy for each share outstanding, or $9.47 billion. At current trading levels, Enron shares are at a 61% discount to the offer price. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, Dynegy and Enron are contemplating an exchange ratio of less than 0.15 of a Dynegy share, or about $5.29 billion. 
The rejiggered deal is an attempt to restore confidence in Enron's ability to carry on its core energy marketing and trading business as the deal moves toward completion, the person said. 
As the market waits for more details from the two companies, some say it will take more than a revised offer to provide takeover traders, also known as arbitrageurs, with enough confidence to play the deal in the typical fashion. 
Often arbitrageurs bet on pending mergers by selling short shares of the acquiring company and buying shares of the target. In this way, the traders hope to profit as the target's share price moves toward the buyer's offer. 
But according to some traders, there is too much risk, even for those accustomed to uncertainty, to play the Dynegy-Enron deal in this way. 
Several traders said they were still wary that the deal could collapse and potentially push Enron into bankruptcy. 
Enron's fortunes took a sharp turn for the worst after investors began to realize the company liberally used accounting loopholes to move its debts into off-balance-sheet financing vehicles, including partnerships run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow. 
""There's nothing like accounting to scare people,"" said one trader, who said there is still a perception in the market that there is more bad news yet to come from Enron.

US Physical Gas Prices End Up On Short-Term Cold

11/27/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
HOUSTON (Dow Jones))--U.S. natural gas physical prices rose Tuesday, boosted by short-term cold weather pushing into the Midcontinent and Texas, traders said. 
But little of that colder air - or demand - reached the Northeast and East Coast, traders said. 
""The Texas market was the big driver,"" said one Gulf Coast trader. ""The Dallas market was buying."" He said Waha gas in the Western Texas hub was trading at a premium to the benchmark Henry Hub. 
Gas was being turned back in the Northeast and East Coast and ""Texas was burning it,"" he said. The cold is expected to last into the weekend, he said. 
Traders said the physical gas-futures spread of nearly $1 per million British thermal units below the New York Mercantile Exchange's December futures contract seen on Monday eased slightly to about 70 cents, but traders still look for sustained cold in December to bring prices back to par. 
Traders still pointed to some constrictions in eastern U.S. pipelines. Pricing was ""all over the place"" in wide variances, a trader who works New York pipelines said. 
In the West, prices also strengthened on the cooler temperatures, traders said. 
Traders also avoided doing physical gas deals with Enron Corp., whose merger with Dynegy Inc. was reportedly being renegotiated. In the meantime, several traders said Enron's gas bids and offers were well above pricing seen on other boards, and were ""out of the market."" 
December goes off the board Wednesday. It settled at $2.606 per million British thermal units, down 9.0 cents. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, traders paid $1.72-$2.09/MMBtu, unchanged on the bid, up 19 cents on the offer. First-of-month November index is $3.16/MMBtu, traders said. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done in a $1.68-$2.02/MMBtu range, down 4 cents on the bid, up 14 cents on the offer. November first-of-month index is $3.19/MMBtu, a trader said. 
At the Arizona-California Border, where gas from El Paso's pipeline begins delivery to Southern California lines, buyers paid $2.35-$2.62/MMBtu, up 12 cents-32 cents. November first-of-month index is $2.95/MMBtu. 
At the Katy hub in East Texas, buyers paid $2.11-$2.40/MMBtu, up 33 cents-35 cents. November index is $3.01/MMBtu. Houston Ship Channel rose 30 cents-33 cents to $2.17-$2.39/MMBtu. Index is $3.12/MMBtu. 
At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $2.17-$2.45/MMBtu, up 25 cents-29 cents. November index is $2.86/MMBtu.

Warrior Gas Company contact is Robert C. (Bob) Lyon - phone 915-688-3838

Vernon, Embassy is getting lined out for January business.  They just got caught in the middle of the ENA fallout, but they are anxious to get a resolution for December in place.  Thanks for your help.

The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or scheduled volume.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

Subject:	Shipper Scheduled Quanties Report.

Per my telephone conversation with Toby this morning, I am writing this e:mail to give my comments on
the new Shipper Scheduled Quantities report.  

I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need for forecasting margins
and invoicing three shippers at this time.  Before the change, I was able to run 1 report for each of these 
shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.  Because the new report does not give me month-to-date totals 
I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day, a total of 21 reports each week.  It is very time 
consuming to run and analyze all these  reports.  As Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume 
will only grow. 

It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper
for each day.

Other comparisons:

1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt
           or delivery point totals.  In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1 
           report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.

2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.  All my files have 
            been set up to accomodate that size of report.  I now have to set up new files.




Thanks!

Raetta and I heard from the mailroom early this afternoon that UPS was suspending service with Enron.  We discussed other options and decided to inquire with UPS or Fed Ex about opening an account thru NNG.

When I contacted UPS, I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron today.  The mailroom is aware of the situation.

Crude Oil Futures Rise as US Urges Tighter Controls on Iraq

    Crude oil rose as much as 1.4% yesterday as the US renewed
efforts to force Iraq to allow more weapons inspections, raising
concern OPEC's 4th-biggest oil producer may temporarily halt
shipments in retaliation. President Bush said the war in Afghanistan
is only the beginning of his fight on terrorism and urged Iraq to
accept a change to trade sanctions that would tighten control of
weapons supply. That may prompt Iraq to refuse to renew a 6-month oil-
for-food program that expires Friday. Crude oil for January delivery
rose as much as $0.27 to $18.96 per barrel in after-hours NYMEX
electronic trading. Oil prices have dropped 29% in the past 3 months
as economic slowdown reduced demand. In London, Brent crude oil on
the IPE fell $0.92 cents yesterday, or 4.8%, to $18.36 per barrel
because of OPEC's failure to persuade Russia to agree to bigger
production cuts.

Dolphin Gas Project Moving Ahead

    Qatar and Abu Dhabi are expected to sign a $3.5 billion agreement
on the inter-Gulf Dolphin natural gas project within a week.
Bureaucracy and red-tape had delayed the final signing of a
development and production sharing agreement. The DPSA will allow the
project sponsor, Dolphin Energy Ltd, to produce up to 2 Bcf per day
from a North Field block and transport it via an sub-sea pipeline to
Abu Dhabi initially. A 2nd phase would increase production to 3 Bcf
per day. DEL will spend $2 billion to drill about 16 wells and build
a production platform and treatment facilities and provide an
additional $1.5 billion for the construction of a 350 km, undersea
pipeline from Qatar to Taweelah, Abu Dhabi. Qatar will own all the
condensate, sulfur, NGL and LPG, extracted from the wet gas, and
charge $1.30 per MMBtu for the dry gas, which will be exported by
DEL. The first delivery of gas to Taweelah is expected in about 2
years. DEL is expected to appoint a financial adviser for the project
soon and select a partner to replace Enron, which pulled out of the
project. State-owned UAE Offsets Group, which holds a 75.5% stake in
DEL, has asked Exxon Mobil, BP, Royal Dutch/Shell, Conoco and
Occidental to submit bids for a 24.5% stake in the project,
previously held by Enron. The selected firm will be in charge of the
building and operation of the subsea pipeline. France's TotalFinaElf,
which also holds a 24.5% share, will oversee the upstream section of
the project.

Angolan LNG Plant May Be Delayed

    A proposed $2 billion liquid natural gas plant in Angola has been
delayed by at least a year due to the merger between Chevron and
Texaco and the possible addition of new partners in the project.
Texaco, which launched the project about 3 years ago, had scheduled
the plant opening in 2005, but it will now likely be 2006.
ChevronTexaco and state oil company, Sonangol, expects to announce
project partners before entering the engineering and design phase in
the next few months. The partners are expected to be BP, TotalFinaElf
and ExxonMobil, all of which operate several offshore blocks
northeast of the capital, Luanda. The LNG plant will be built on a
refinery site operated by TotalFinaElf in northern Luanda. The site 
has capacity for four trains. The refinery and the 4 million tonne
per year LNG plant would save by sharing water, security and other
services. ChevronTexaco produces about 600,000 bpd of Angola's total
750,000 bpd output. Since the merger was approved last month, the
companies have been mapping out the new companies projects and it is
still not clear what priority will be given to the project. Angola is
expected to grant approval quickly because of concerns about properly
using its gas reserves and eliminating flaring. The gas will be
marketed in Europe and the Americas, but will face tough competition
from countries such as Nigeria, which leads Angola in sub-Sahara oil
production.

FBI Warns of Possible Pipeline Attacks

    The FBI has warned oil and natural gas companies that Osama bin
Laden may have called for an attack on US natural gas facilities if
he is captured or killed. Federal investigators received a report of
undetermined reliability that natural gas supplies could be targeted.
Energy companies already have increased security at pipelines,
refineries, nuclear power plants and other facilities.

Possible Law Suits Could Threaten OPEC Production Cut


    If oil companies like Venezuela's PDVSA, Mexico's Pemex, Norway's
Statoil and Russia's Lukoil join OPEC in cutting exports in order to
lift oil prices, they could become the target of lawsuits by airlines
for price fixing. If the proposed cut in exports is judged to be an
illegal conspiracy under US antitrust statutes, direct purchasers
could sue for treble damages. Citgo could be a target because it
sells jet fuel directly to airlines. It has been rumored that at
least 2 airlines are considering legal action. Such an action would
certainly be a threat to OPEC's plans to cut another 1.5 million bpd
to raise sagging prices, but the deal hinges on the cooperation of
non-OPEC producers. Private companies exposure to legal action would
be greater than OPEC states, which claim exemption from antitrust
laws as sovereign nations. Private lawsuits could prevent accused oil
firms from operating in US capital markets or acquiring US assets.

Baker Hughes Rig Counts

    The number of rigs searching for oil and natural gas in the US
fell by 7 to 986 last week, according to Baker Hughes.  There were
1064 a year ago. The number of rigs exploring in Canada was down 14
to 254, compared to 380 last year. The number in the Gulf of Mexico
was unchanged at 129, compared to 141 a year ago. The number of rigs
searching on land was 832, down 8, and the number of offshore rigs
was steady at 134. There were 20 inland rigs, up one. The total North
American rig count dropped by 21 to 1,240, compared to 1,444 a year
ago. The number of rigs searching for oil fell by 1 to 172, and the
number searching for natural gas dipped 6 to 814.

"FW: FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001","Lynn,

Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?

Thanks,

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Service this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tulsa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  This is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  They would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyday to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to capture, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks, 

Bob

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	""The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows.""

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

"NNG Flowing Gas Documents","Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

"RE: SBA Contracts","In a discussion with Steve Kirk, prior to changing the priorities, it was agreed that SBA shippers should have priority over Interruptible and Alternate shippers only.  Firm shippers would continue to have priority over SBA shippers.  Since Gerry's group implemented the changes, we have not been in a situation where a SBA was called to come in (or go out) at an allocated point.  Gerry's system requirements as to how the system would operate under these conditions would be the support you need to verify that Firm shippers have priority over SBAs.   

Gerry, would you forward Michelle a copy of the System Requirement?   Thanks.

Michele,
I'm not sure the information is readily available, if available at all. TMS data is only maintained, without extraordinary measures, for 6 months. It is my recollection that there may have been an allocation at a point where SBA gas was scheduled and when that occurred the standard allocation procedures were enforced. I think once we asked the shipper  to move the SBA activity to another point, but that was pre GISB. Unfortunately, because of the how the SBA's work, the pack, draft and peak points are negotiated in advance which limits the points to use. Also, the 28-30 hr lead time required for notification means that we have to anticipate what system conditions will become and therein use SBAs to improve system conditions. Sometimes we miss the mark, either cold weather does not materialize or moves in late or shipper activity increases and in hindsight, an SBA was not necessary.  

Reyna may have some additional insight in more recent SBA activities.

	I guess the question is - have we ever actually reviewed when we call on the SBA volumes and what the system conditions have been during those periods.  We want to verify that we are not allocating a point when we have SBA gas flowing.  Theatrically, we argue that we would not call on SBAs if the gas was not needed to meet system requirements.  We' want to verify that the theory and the actual match up.  I hope this makes sense.  Thanks MW

"NOAA Weather Forecast Released","Note:  The summary of the new NOAA winter forecast is below.  If you want to see the entire version, click on this site:  http://www.noaa.gov/

NOAA Sees Cold Winter Ahead 
The United States can expect another colder-than-normal winter, with temperatures similar to last winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said in its winter outlook, confirming recent private forecasts, most notably that of Salomon Smith Barney Meteorologist Jon Davis earlier this week.
For most of the United States, winter 2001-02 will feel like a sequel to last year's cold season, NOAA said, with sharp swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South, and the potential for Nor'easters along the East Coast. 
NOAA said the absence of a strong El Ni?o or La Ni?a climate pattern leaves the door open for a highly variable winter, which will impact the winter weather extremes such as cold, snow, rain and ice that the nation may experience. 
""We don't expect a repeat of the record-breaking cold temperatures of November-December of last year, but this winter should be cooler than the warm winters of the late 1990s,"" said Scott Gudes, NOAA's acting administrator. ""Citizens should prepare for the full range of winter weather."" 
Climate factors that influenced last winter will play a similar role this season. They include the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest. 
""This winter, NOAA's improving technologies will help National Weather Service forecasters -- for the first time -- pinpoint when these factors will kick in and bring extreme weather,"" said Jack Kelly, director of NOAA's National Weather Service. 
Colder-than-normal temperatures are expected in the Northeast. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation. The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation, NOAA said. The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have an equal chance of averaging above normal, normal or below normal. 
In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal. The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. 
The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures. In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely. NOAA said to expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest (except western California) and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation.

"FW: File Restore Request","Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I contacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a business reason and director level approval is required before any restoration work can begin. 
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sheet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. In addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track potential imbalance activity on NNG's system. 
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the restoration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can continue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Departments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.
Thanks,
Mike

     [IMAGE]LOVE MA-SHEEN!  [IMAGE]Charlie flips for curvy 'Spin City' co-star    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] CHARLIE SHEEN   ""Spin City"" star Charlie Sheen is dizzy over a beauty who captured his heart right on the set of his show.   Sheen has taken a shine to gorgeous actress Denise Richards, his co-star for five episodes of the ABC comedy this season.   ""Charlie is crazy about Denise,"" an insider told The ENQUIRER. ""He's really fallen hard for her.   ""His dad Martin, the star of 'The West Wing,' even came to the 'Spin City' set to meet Denise. Martin is thrilled his son is so happy.   ""This is Charlie's first serious relationship in years.""    [IMAGE] DENISE RICHARDS  Charlie, 36, and 30-year-old Denise - a former ""James Bond"" stunner - first met in June 2000 when they worked together on the movie ""Good Advice.""   ""Charlie liked her back then but she had a boyfriend so nothing happened,"" said the insider. ""Then Charlie recommended her for a guest spot on 'Spin City' this season - and she was so good that one episode turned into five.""   Once they were face-to-face again, Sheen was quickly smitten.   ""Charlie says she is so beautiful that when he acted in scenes with her he had to stare at her forehead because her beauty destroyed his concentration!"" revealed the insider.   ""When they first started dating about two months ago they kept it hidden from everyone on the set.    ""They didn't want people they worked with talking about it.   ""While they have gone out to restaurants and shops together, they prefer to stay home. They watch movies and baseball and spend a lot of quiet evenings alone.   ""People close to both of them think they're going to be together for a long, long time.""  [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]PREGNANT LIZ HURLEY IN TEARS AS DAD-TO-BE SKIPS TOWN    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] LIZ HURLEY  Pregnant Liz Hurley jetted from London to Los Angeles for a showdown with ex-boyfriend Steve Bing over their baby's future - only to be cruelly snubbed by the reluctant dad-to-be.   So the three-months-pregnant damsel in distress turned for help to her old Sir Galahad - Hugh Grant!   Tearful Liz phoned Hugh in England - and he hopped a Concorde to be by her side as the party-hearty playboy she's dubbed Bing Laden skipped town.   Liz, 36, and Hugh, 41, huddled at an L.A. restaurant together to discuss tactics.   Now Hugh's vowed to back the beauty all the way in her battle to get Bing to face up to his responsibilities as a father.   Gallant Grant is even demanding a man-to-man meeting with the skirt-chasing movie producer, say sources.   ""This plot's getting crazier than any movie Hugh or Liz has been in,"" declared a showbiz insider who knows the couple.    ""Bing knew Liz was heading for L.A. to see him, but he picked that time to leave town with his buddy Mick Jagger so they could party in Las Vegas for a couple of days.   ""Liz was distraught, and she turned to the only man she trusts now - Hugh.""   Last week The ENQUIRER revealed exclusively how ex-beau Hugh was trying to woo back Liz after Bing - heir to a $600 million real estate fortune - told her he didn't want to be a dad.   ""Hugh dropped everything to fly to her in L.A.,"" disclosed an insider. ""That's how much she means to him.    ""He hopes by being there for Liz she won't be able to imagine a future without him.""

Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late ""preliminary"" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

"FBI: Bin Laden may target Energy Industry","WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 -  ""The oil and gas industry is on high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death"", news sources said Monday.

The FBI alerted the American Petroleum Institute, who works directly with Energy Department on security, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies.

""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have
approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said
the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined
reliability.""

The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in
the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either
captured or killed.""

Representatives from the world's leading energy companies, policy makers and industry experts will gather January 24, 2002 in Washington DC at the World Energy Security and Commerce forum (http://www.wesc.org) to discuss the new realities facing executives responsible for securing energy assets, transporting them to market and balancing changing political climates.

"NNG (Black Marlin) Allocations","Bill:  Can you direct me to the person who allocates the Black Marlin delivery meter for Transok.  I think we (NNG) are getting information only for the volumes through the meter for the account of Lamar Power.  Now, since we have only two delivery points, you might think I could subtract - but...I really need to know that the allocations for Lamar Power and AEP sum to the actual meter volume between Transok and NNG.  Can you help?  Steve Weller (713-853-3000)

Guess we better look at turning the C line around on the 31st, or should we wait until the 2nd, to make sure they get up? sj

"RE: All tests were NOT successfully executed  **Update**","As indicated below, there was a problem with the server configuration last night.  It appears that when one part of the system encountered a problem and failed over to the backup as it should have, there was a problem with the system security.  ENW management has assured us that they are taking a closer look at the cause of the problem we experienced, so they can determine a long-term solution to minimize future downtime.

All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

Crude Oil Futures Fall on OPEC Stalemate with Russia


    Crude oil futures for January delivery on the NYMEX dipped $0.18
to $18.96 per barrel on Wednesday. Global oil prices climbed on
Thursday after Russia indicated it was willing to make larger cuts
than its previously announced 30,000 bpd. But on Friday, Russia said
it would cut 50,000 bpd for the 4th quarter, but made no future
commitments to curb production, which produced another drop in global
oil prices. However, the former Soviet country said further cuts were
possible before its December 10th deadline for setting next years
production levels. Although, Russia's top economic advisor said that
it would be ridiculous to try to lift oil prices when the world was
entering a recession. In response to bulging crude oil inventories,
plummeting demand and prices, OPEC was expected to cut production by
up to 1.5 million bpd at its Vienna meeting last week, but instead
said it will not make any cuts in production without a meaningful
slice in Russian output. The cartel has sought cooperation from non-
OPEC members, specifically Russia, Norway and Mexico to trim exports
by a combined 500,000 bpd. So far, the organization has received
pledges from Mexico and Norway to reduce production by 100,000 and
200,000 bpd respectively. December gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell
0.0008 to $0.5273 per gallon on Wednesday. Heating oil futures for
December delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.0034 to $0.5342 per gallon. In
London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery climbed $1.17 to
$19.90 per barrel on Thursday, but were down $0.62 to $19.28 per
barrel on Friday.

LPG Unit at Texas Refinery Explodes


Witnesses say a huge fire-ball erupted over the 100,000 bpd Crown
Central Petroleum oil refinery in Pasadena, TX last Friday. Damage
was limited to the liquefied petroleum gas unit where the explosion
occurred. The privately held Crown Central said the blast occurred
during early phases of a scheduled 4-week maintenance period at its
Houston Ship Channel refinery. Although none of the refinery's other
units seemed to have been damaged, the whole plant was closed down as
a precautionary measure.

Russia Becomes Lone Hold-Out

    In yet another attempt to convince Russia to commit to
significant output curbs, OPEC is calling on non-members to cooperate
in an effort to lift sinking oil prices. OPEC has said it will not
act alone in reducing exports. Earlier this month, the cartel said it
would trim production by 1.5 million bpd if non-members such as
Mexico, Norway and Russia contribute another 500,000 bpd. Mexico has
said it would make an 100,000 bpd cut. And last week Norway chimed in
with pledge of a 200,000 bpd reduction. But so far, Russia, the
worlds 2nd largest oil producer does not seem inclined to join the
party, despite raising their planned output reduction to 50,000 bpd
from a previously announced 30,000 bpd. OPEC's secretary general says
the organization is working to prevent a catastrophe in oil prices.

Lawsuit Filed Over Phillips, Conoco Merger

    Conoco has been sued over a planned $15.4 billion merger with
Phillips to form the 3rd largest US oil company. The lawsuit contends
that the merger undervalues Conoco shares. The deal would exchange
0.4677 share of the new company for each Conoco share. Shares of
Conoco were up $0.54 to $27.30 per share last week while shares of
Phillips gained $0.72 to $55.00, valuing Conoco at $25.72 relative to
Phillips. Conoco shares have seen an 8.1% increase from $24.30 per
share on November 16th, just before the merger was announced. The
lawsuit alleges that Conocos directors failed to fulfill their
obligations by not properly seeking the best alternative for its
shareholders. The suit also contends that the transaction includes no
premium for Conoco shareholders and also seeks class-action status
and an order forcing directors to explore available alternatives to
the deal.

Arctic Drilling Effected by Lower Natural Gas Prices

     The drilling industry ready for an active winter season on the
tundra of Canada's far north, but low natural gas prices and a weak
economy have lowered expectations of a boom time. Most companies such
as Petro-Canada and Paramount Resources  are pressing ahead with
exploration in the rugged Northwest Territories. Due to marshy
conditions for the rest of the year, wells are drilled in winter when
the ground freezes. Petro-Canada plans to drill three 9,840-foot deep
wells in the Mackenzie Delta and Paramount intends to drill two wells 
farther south, near Fort Liard, below the Arctic Circle. The region
could hold trillions of cubic feet of natural gas. In recent
federally supervised land sales, producers committed to spending
C$650 million on exploration over the next few years just in the
Mackenzie Delta. But some wells in theYukon and the Northwest
Territories' central Mackenzie Valley have been canceled or delayed
by Canadian Natural Resources. But the troubled economy and the drop
in prices from $10 per MMBtu last January are having an impact. Akita
Drilling is keeping two new rigs in Alberta this winter and delaying
the move of the C$18 million units to the Mackenzie Delta until later
in 2002. Imperial Oil, Shell Canada and Conoco are studying building
a C$3 billion pipeline to transport about a Bcf per day of Arctic
volumes to southern Canada and the US.

Nigeria Orders Oil Meeting Cancelled


      Nigeria has ordered British and US diplomats to cancel a
meeting with the governors of the West African nation's oil-producing
states, calling it a threat its sovereignty. Nigeria's minister of
state for foreign affairs summoned the US ambassador and British
Deputy High Commissioner to tell them the meeting scheduled for today
must be called off. British and American diplomats said the meeting
never meant to undermine the central government. The meeting was to
share information with the governors on some environmental issues
that would be beneficial to the oil producing communities. Royal
Dutch Shell is Nigeria's largest producer accounting for about half
of the country's daily crude oil output of about two million barrels,
followed by ExxonMobil, which pumps about 620,000 bpd. Nigeria's oil-
producing states and the federal government have been fighting over
control of its oil resources.

Duke to Import Natural Gas to Italy

  Duke Energy is selling natural gas and electricity into the Italian
market via its energy trading business, and could also bid for one of
the generating companies to be sold by Enel. Duke's effort to boost
its presence in Italy includes plans to open offices in Milan.  Duke
is interested in acquiring generating capacity in the Italian market,
either through acquisitions or contracts involving the rental of
generators. If Duke does actually bid for generating capacity, its
target would be Interpower, the third of a group of generating units
that Italian power giant Enel is selling off to comply with EU rules
aimed at fostering competition in Italy's energy market.

[IMAGE]   Your inspirational quote for the day:  [IMAGE]     Hang Onto Each Other   [IMAGE]  Too often we feel alone. But there is always someone ready to take our hand. There is a beautiful story of an overworked nurse who escorted a tired, young man to her patient's bed -side. Leaning over and speaking loudly to the elderly patient, she said, ""Your son is here.""   With great effort, his unfocussed eyes opened, then flickered shut again. The young man squeezed the aged hand in his and sat beside the bed. Throughout the night he sat there, holding the old man's hand and whispering words of comfort.   By morning's light, the patient had died. In moments, hospital staff swarmed into the room to turn off machines and remove needles. The nurse stepped over to the young man's side and began to offer sympathy, but he interrupted her.   ""Who was that man?"" he asked.   The startled nurse replied, ""I thought he was your father!"" ""No, he was not my father"", he answered. I never saw him before in my life."" ""Then, why didn't you say something when I took you to him?""   ""I realized he needed his son and his son wasn't here"", the man explained. ""And since he was too sick to recognize that I was not his son, I knew he needed me.""   Mother Teresa used to remind us that nobody should have to die alone. Likewise, nobody should have to grieve alone or cry alone either. Or laugh alone or celebrate alone.   We are made to travel life's journey hand in hand. There is someone ready to grasp your hand today. And someone hoping you will take theirs. Remember To Hang On To One Another!

I know most of you have read Shelley's email about the Performance Review process for year end.  I apologize for the short turnaround and that we have not had time to set down and
talk about the changes we are making.  I do believe the changes will be very beneficial and bring us a step closer to enhancing the process. 
 
I know you have a lot of questions and therefore on Tuesday, November 27, I will replace my team leader meeting with 3 meetings, one for each team.  I will start the first meeting at 1:30 p.m. In the meantime, if you have any questions that need to be answered immediately, please get with John or Terry and they will get you the answers.  Remember we are trying to simplify the process for everyone as well as getting valuable feedback on each employee.
 
In the meantime, please be thinking about your four selections and submit them by Tuesday, November 27th
at 5:00 p.m.
 
Have a great Thanksgiving and I'll see you on Tuesday.  Lynn

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

"George Clooney's Bizarre Marriage & Wacky Divorce","
[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE]	


     [IMAGE]GEORGE CLOONEY'S BIZARRE MARRIAGE & WACKY DIVORCE     [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] GEORGE CLOONEY was once married, and some of his friends had no idea.   No wonder George Clooney has become a confirmed bachelor - his only marriage didn't last as long as the divorce wrangling!   Clooney wed actor Martin Balsam's daughter Talia on Dec. 15, 1989, and they separated 20 months later. But it took 25 months before the divorce decree became final in September 1993.   The couple fought long and hard in court over their community property - including George's prize possession, a potbellied pig named Max.   ""George wound up getting Max although Talia had become very fond of him,"" Talia's uncle, actor Dick Van Patten, told The ENQUIRER. ""They fought over that - it was like a child custody battle!   ""George didn't treat Talia badly during the marriage. I remember he took her to Vegas for their honeymoon. But after they were wed he just decided, 'I guess I shouldn't have gotten married. I didn't know what this marriage business was like.'   ""It was too confining for him.""   At the time of the marriage, George, now 40, was a struggling actor who was ""pursuing stardom with a vengeance, but Talia wanted a more traditional marriage so she was not at all that supportive,"" a close friend revealed.   ""Over the course of their marriage, they continued to grow apart because they could not find a compromise. Eventually, George started getting better and better roles and people started to really notice him - especially women.   ""George and Talia began arguing more often because he wasn't home a lot, so they finally decided it would be best for both of them if they divorced.   ""That's when things got really ugly. George was furious when Talia - whose family had money - insisted she get all the furniture and other household goods because as a struggling actor, it took him a long time to acquire those things.""   In the end, Clooney got a baby grand piano, a 1959 Corvette, a 1983 Harley, a l988 Saab and a 1991 motor home, plus the money in four bank accounts, interests in partnerships, stocks and a Studio City house.   Talia got $95,000 in cash from George, her jewelry, some bank accounts and a 1988 Dodge.   Each was allowed to keep whatever ""furniture, furnishings, artwork, antiques, fixtures, personal mementos, household equipment and appliances, crystal, china, flatware and linens currently in (their) possession,"" according to court papers.   Said the friend: ""That whole experience didn't turn George off women, but it did turn him off to getting married again.""   Even while he was married, George always acted very much like a single guy, say sources.   ""I had no idea there was a Mrs. Clooney,"" said a waitress at Du-Par's restaurant, where Clooney was a fixture. ""Nobody did.    ""He was in here all the time with a group of buddies. He was the quintessential single guy.""   And a former neighbor in Studio City disclosed: ""We all remember the pig, but most people had no idea George was married.   ""Some days he kept the pig in the yard outside. Some neighbors complained it smelled. It never bothered me. It just snorted at night sometimes.   ""But as for his wife - I never saw her. Then she was gone and he lived there with a few buddies.""   Talia married actor John Slattery in 1998, and they live happily in New York City.   Said a New York pal: ""Talia's husband is gorgeous, he makes her laugh. They're really connected. So I'd say she's done pretty well since George. I don't think she's crying over him at all.""   [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]     [IMAGE]    [IMAGE]HALLE BERRY STRIPS FOR ""MONSTER'S BALL""    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] HALLE BERRY  Attention Halle Berry fans! If you were excited to see her bare breasts in ""Swordfish,"" you're in for another bare-all Berry-fest with her newest film ""Monster's Ball,"" with Billy Bob Thornton.    According to reports, producers had to cut a sex scene that would have put the movie at an NC- 17 rating because of its very graphic content.    ""I would only do it if Billy Bob agreed to be as naked as I was,"" Berry told the New York Times Magazine. She also added that the nudity in ""Swordfish"" was ""gratuitous,"" but that it gave her the courage to take it all off one more time for ""Monster's Ball.""    ""We shot the sex scene on Day 19 of a 21-day shoot,"" saidBerry. ""I always say Billy Bob and I dated for three weeks, and then we had sex.""    ""Monster's Ball"" opened this week to audiences in New York and Los Angeles.

Crude Oil Futures Regain Some of Last Weeks Losses

    Crude oil futures for December delivery on the NYMEX climbed
$0.58 to $18.03 per barrel on Friday. After OPEC decided last week to
the delay in its plan to trim 1.5 million bpd from its output, crude
prices plunged 19%, likely in an overreaction to a looming price war.
Traders may have realized that a price war will not happen until at
least January 1st, and that meanwhile OPEC and non-member producers
may reach an agreement. Only Mexico has indicated willingness to aid
OPEC by saying it would cut production by 100,000 bpd if others
outside of OPEC also make cuts. Norway says it will discuss possible
cuts later this week. The IEA says that demand tumbled by 2.5% in
September, the sharpest monthly drop in 2001. However, the drop in
oil prices could help stimulate the US economy by puttig more
spending money in consumers pockets. In addition, lower jet fuel
costs could help the airline industry to recover from its meltdown in
the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks. December gasoline
futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0138 to $0.5022 per gallon. Heating oil
futures for December delivery on the NYMEX gained $0.0109 to $0.5218
per gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery
on the IPE were up $0.42 to $17.75 per barrel.

Russia Defends Stand on Crude Oil Production Cuts


Defending Russia's decision to not cooperate with OPEC on production
cuts to lift oil prices, its prime minister said that no one could
make demands of the country and that lower prices were not that much
of a concern for Moscow. OPEC recently decided to delay a much
anticipated 1.5 million bpd reduction in output until Russia agrees
to join other non-OPEC members in production cuts of 500,000 bpd.
Russia's prime minister contends that market fluctuations have
happened in the past and will continue to happen and a calm attitude
is needed. He said that a waiting period was needed in order to
properly judge what was happening on the market. He also added that
the country's policy was to balance its own interests and those of
producers and consumers. Russia needs to keep pumping oil in order to
meet repayments on $140 billion of foreign debt. Mexico's energy
secretary has visited Moscow to urge them to consider bigger
reductions in output. Mexico has said it would cut exports by 100,000
bpd if other non-OPEC producers would cut commensurately. Norway, the
worlds 3rd largest producer, has not offered to slice output so far,
but has said it will review its position next week. Venezuela's
energy minister also said he would visit Russia in December to lobby
for support. Russia's oil companies seem to have conflicting opinions
on the wisdom of making a big production cut. YUKOS, the country's
2nd largest oil company, has said it would fight output cuts and that
any reduction by Russia would simply lead other regional producers
such as Kazakhstan supplying volumes instead. Meanwhile, LUKOIL,
Russia's largest oil producer, said it could close some unprofitable
wells and that there other ways for Russia to manage under low oil
revenues. The company believes that the balance of the rouble and the
dollar is the key. If oil prices stay at $15 per barrel and the
government and the central bank decide to devalue the rouble to 33-35
per dollar, currently at 30, it would be equal to the price of $21-22
per barrel.

Russian Oil Companies See No Reason to Back OPEC Cuts

    The reborn Russian oil industry, which almost fell to ruin after
the Soviet Union toppled, may soon find itself involved in an price
war with OPEC. The cartel has trimmed output 3 times so far this year
and says it won't cut more unless Russia cooperates with significant
reductions of its own. However, the former communist country does not
appear willing to cooperate, despite a 45% plunge in prices from a
year ago, offering a token cut of 30,000 bpd from its 7 million bpd
production. Former state-owned companies in Russia have boosted oil
output by resurrecting fields in Siberia. Higher oil prices over the
last 2 years aided the turnaround in the Russian oil industry,
providing funding for new drilling and boosting production. After
communism fell, many companies were acquired cheaply by influential
members of the previous regime, who exhibit a reluctance to slice
output even with oil prices around $17.50 per barrel as they try to
boost their global market share. Some in Russia say that $16  $22 per
barrel is a fair price and that the country should work with Norway
and the EU to maintain that price. Traders say they do not expect any
significant reductions from Russia. Although the government maintains
leverage over its oil companies by controlling export pipelines, the
current administration has set its sights on improving relations with
the US, which many think want cheaper oil. The country has a
population of 150 million and exports only 33% of its oil and 19% of
refined products, which can be shipped by railways and tankers,
bypassing state-controlled pipelines.

Chemical Stocks Rally on Lower Oil Prices

    Tumbling oil prices may give some relief to the chemical industry
in its worst downturn in nearly two decades, although the boost may
not be enough to offset already crippled demand. Chemical stocks have
rallied since oil prices began a steady decline to two-year lows in
mid-September. Shares of the larger companies have gained about 20%,
while the Standard & Poor's chemical composite index is up more than
9%. The rally occurred despite a dismal 3rd quarter results.  Crude
oil prices plunged last Thursday and hit 2-year lows.

FERC Reconsiders Maryland LNG Plant


    The FERC has concluded a conference with state and local
officials on national security concerns associated with re-opening
the Cove Point LNG plant, which is 3.5 miles from the Calvert Cliffs
nuclear power plant in southern Maryland. The commission had given
Williams permission to restart the plant last month. However,
concerns about possible sabotage on tankers from Algeria or other
foreign countries, under foreign flags with foreign crews, delivering
LNG to the plant prompted the commission to re-think its decision.
The conference was closed to the public because of the security-
sensitive nature of the subject being discussed. A tanker carrying
LNG was recently the focal point of a public battle between local and
federal officials. The Coast Guard had closed Boston's Harbor to the
tanker following the September 11th attacks because of worries that
the highly flammable substance could cause mass destruction if it
became the target of a terrorist attack. The Coast Guard eventually
decided to allow the tanker to be unloaded, but Boston's mayor was
outraged and proceeded with legal action, which was denied.
Washington Gas, whose customers are served by the Cove Point
pipeline, said that communications should be improved between the LNG
plant and state and federal officials in case of a threat. In FERC's
approval last month, it ordered the facility to establish a direct
independent communication link with staff at the nuclear power plant,
and develop a backup plan.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

	In reference to this weekend's activity, I contacted Bob Superty as to their plans for nominations and explained that payment must be received today to permit any transportation. My call was returned by Suzanne Calcagno who advised they were not in a position to make payment but hoped to know more next week. I advised that we would require the prepayment and she understood and appreciated our call.

"RE: Work At Home Meeting","Lynn,
Remedy has been updated to give home office workers a high priority and to be assigned to Glenn or Robert when possible.

Glenn did install a modem in Shirley's machine.

There is still some issue with the CITRIX Server and VPN access, the solution center believes the problem is on the Road Runner side and Jean McFarland is working on it. Everyone is working from home with little to no problems despite the CITRIX issue.

The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

Subject: FW: Receipt Points


Lynn:  Please verify that if Koch realigns their 35,000/d contract (K# 20510)such that their MDQ at Carlton matches their Carlton flow obligation of 2,828 and has the rest of their 32,172/d at Marshall (They would need to realign 30 mcf from Carlton to Marshall to effectuate the above, and I've checked with Doug Aschwege to make sure he would approve it.) that Steve's and my interpretation as described below is correct.  Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Subject: Receipt Points


Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips

From 10:30 p.m. - 11:00 p.m., Fiber maintenance will be performed in the 41st floor wiring closet. This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet to the 41st floor server room.  Connectivity between servers in the 41st floor server room and the Enron network will be disrupted. The cabling engineer believes the change should take less than 30 minutes.  If he runs into a problem, the outage could possibly be two hours.
Oct 28		
From 1:45 a.m. - 2:15 a.m., sysAdmiral master system will be shut down during the time change from Daylight Savings Time to Standard Time. This is being done as a precautionary measure due to a potential sysAdmiral bug.

** High Priority **

Per discussion with Chris Sebesta, Alliant Energy has been informed of impending storage allocations for the upcoming holiday weekend.

For the weekend, we want to schedule maximum storage withdrawals (to protect against zone allocations) and we want to ""schedule"" the firm right to reduce our withdrawal to zero in the final nomination cycle.   We expect NNG to honor our FIRM MAX RATE storage contract rights before they schedule a single dth of interruptible storage.

Please confirm our firm rights for all 3 of our Alliant Energy Utilities.  We would like this confirmation by 3:00pm this afternoon in order to properly notify our customers of any necessary constraints.

Until advised, please limit travel and entertainment expenses.  If you are required to travel on business, you will need to use your personal credit cards or cash and submit your expenses through the XMS expense account system at:  https://expensexms.enron.com/ewp/ .

As soon as we have a revised PPA invoice for October that we feel will be the final info, could you fax a copy to me.  The customer is waiting for some other data from me that uses SMS and DDVC amounts for the past year, and I cannot finish the info for him until we have this resolved.  I'd like to call him and give him an update.  Do you know approximately when we might have the revised PPA?

Thanks,

I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email

can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the

[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE]	


     [IMAGE]LUCY LAWLESS PREGNANT    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] LUCY LAWLESS     According to her publicist, Leah Krantzler, Lucy Lawless and her husband are expecting another child.   This will be the second for Lawless and her husband Rob Tapert, producer for Xena -- Warrior Princess. The couple already have a son, 2-year-old Julius, and Lawless has a daughter - Daisy, 13 - from a previous marriage.   In a statement, Kranzler revealed that Lawless is due in late April or early May of next year. The sex of the baby was not announced.   Lawless has most recently appeared on the season premiere of The X-Files, with producers leaving the possibility of a recurring role open. However, her publicist says that won't happen.  [IMAGE]      [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]BRAD PITT FINALLY ON 'FRIENDS'    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] BRAD PITT  Ever since Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have been together, the question has been: When will Brad guest star on 'Friends'?   Well, it will be a happy Thanksgiving for fans of the show -- Pitt will appear on Thursday's episode.    Pitt plays an old high school friend of Courteney Cox's character Monica. She invites him to share Thanksgiving dinner with her and the rest of the gang. But tensions flare when he sees Aniston's character, Rachel -- they were enemies in high school.   In an interview, Pitt says he and Aniston have some ""gangbuster"" scenes together. He also reveals that he is a longtime fan of the show. ""It's a happy show,"" said Pitt. ""It comes on and it makes me happy. It's always been that way since its first incarnation, before I met my wife.""   Pitt also said that it had not been decided whether his character will return in future episodes, or if it will be a one time only appearance.   Stay Tuned!

"RE: TMS SQL2K migration","Ramona,
The user acceptance testing is schedule for 10/22 thru 11/02.  I am not sure why the model office refresh should be an issue.  we should be able to postpone the refresh for until after the production migration.
I will make the change in my project plan for user testing to finish on 11/01, this will still put for implementation the weekend of 11/03.

thanks

Hasan,
I could not open this file. Gerry printed it for me. I was not sure I followed the test plan. Is it testing from Oct. 19th to Nov. 2nd?
Since we will have a new model office refresh to deal with on the Oct. 31st, we would like to push to be complete with testing by Wednesday. Oct. 31st, and plan for Thursday night migration which is Nov. 1st.

I will have Kathy Washington, Maggie Matheson, and myself testing for the next two weeks beginning Monday Oct. 22 nd testing through Nov. 1st. Will that work for your team? Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the project plan for TMS migration to SQL2K.

Couple of key items to note.  In order to create an implementation date, I took the liberty of allocating 2 weeks for user testing.  This could change based on customer input.  Additionally, Model Office refresh is very critical.  I have tentatively scheduled it for 10/17 and 10/18.  Any changes to either the Model office refresh dates or the testing schedule will impacting the implementation date.

thanks

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks,

As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

"All tests were not completely successfully","
All testing was performed, and was successful except for the following:
although ENW Resolution Center confirmed that Exchange servers are up, they have received reports that some people get a login screen when trying to access their Outlook.  They are instructing their users to cancel by the message.  We have not observed this problem in ETS.
while attempting to access the Flow Gas application, we were unable to hit www.infosource.com.  We paged the Business Objects on-call pager and will continue to follow up.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

We get this report from your operations group and  I was wondering if you could
please forward this request to the correct person for the addition of a couple
of people.  I think there is a limit so please let me know how many people can
be on the list and we might be able to create an internal address that would
forward to each of us.  Here are the people that need to be on the list:

Greg_Hathaway@dom.com- on the email
Mark_Moyer@dom.com- on the email
Hillary_Dryselius@dom.com- I believe on the list
Jason_J_Lewis@dom.com- not on the list
Mark_J_DeCarlo@dom.com- not on the list
Stacy_Lee@dom.com- not sure if she is on the list
MWVPEM@hotmail.com- not sure on the list, but for weekend notices

Thanks

"FW: SBA Priority during Allocations","Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Do you have an estimated time of implementation?  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Thank you for your help.

I have worked up the requirements and the TMS IT group is evaluating the changes.  Due to the CMS implementation we would not be able to implement this change.  The earliest we might be able to implement is Mid to late October.  If you have any questions please call.  Thank you.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

	Mike, thanks for the update.  I have a couple of questions/comments:

	1.  Is Legal and Regulatory in the loop on these decisions?

	2.  Anything we can automate, I would like to ensure we have the automation on the enhancement
	     list.  I like the idea of automating the last bullet.  I am not sure if it is in CMS or elsewhere, but
	     I would like to be sure we pursue this automation.
	Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

Crude Oil Futures Slide Despite OPEC Cut


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.49
to $20.41 per barrel on Friday, despite OPEC's official announcement
of a 1.5 million bpd cut in production after other producers agreed
to slice 462,500 bpd from their combined output. Crude oil prices
rose to $21.38 per barrel but then slumped after OPEC's president
said the cartel would be happy with anything above $20 per barrel for
Brent crude. However many doubt not only the cartels ability, but the
strength of commitment by non-members to stick to their lower
production quotas. The OPEC countries with quotas pumped 600,000 over
their limits in November. But Nigeria was responsible for half of the
cheating, producing 300,000 barrels over its quota. Nigeria's OPEC
representative is slated to become the cartel's new president on
January 1st, effectively putting pressure on the country to adhere to
its limits. Some positive news for the market was found as consumer
confidence posted its biggest gain in almost 4 years, home sales
climbed and unemployment rates stabilized. Heating oil futures for
January delivery on the NYMEX declined $0.0015 to $0.5665 per gallon.
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX fell $0.0071 to $0.5856 per
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for February delivery on
the IPE were down $0.04 to $20.30 per barrel.

Refining Margins Forecast to Shrink in 2002

    Oil refiners around the world will likely experience shrinking
profit margins in 2002 as a global economic slump has sharply lowered
demand. The US, Asia and Northwest Europe all have a hefty oversupply
of oil inventories. Refinery runs can be expected to stay 10% - 50%
below capacity in Asia. Although the percentage may not be as quite
as dismal in Europe and the many still expect lower refinery profits
for early 2002 and possibly for most of the year on both continents.
Asia's margins were mostly negative this year while US margins hit $6-
$9 per barrel early in 2001 but fell to $3 - $4 per barrel later in
the year. European margins were mostly unchanged at an average of
about $2.00 per barrel. In Northwest Europe, refiners' profits depend
on how US gasoline prices fare, as a large portion of Europe's
surplus gasoline is exported across the Atlantic. Northwest European
refiners have cut up to 20% of runs in the last month. On average for
2001, margins for Northwest Europe refineries running Brent crude are
estimated to be less than $2.00 per barrel, below the $3.00 average
for 2000, but well above the $1.20 per barrel Northwest European
margins of 1999.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector

    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in
the weather. In the category of energy stocks, oilfield services can
be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and
downs of drilling activity. When companies lower their drilling
activity, equipment and service companies do not get hired but still
have many fixed costs. The upstream oil and natural gas exploration
and production business is the next most volatile sector of the
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55%
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year.
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards
more volatile energy stocks.

Judge Recuses Himself in Unocal Patent Case

Unocal has said that a US District Court Judge recused himself from
the case involving infringement on the its '393 gasoline patent due
to his discovery that he had a financial interest in one of the
parties involved. The case will be returned for reassignment. In
October, the judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment
requesting an accounting of infringement of its '393 cleaner burning
gasoline patent by 5 refiners. However, a written judgment had not
been issued. Further proceedings in the case will now be considered
by the new judge. The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield,
Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Shell. In 1997, a jury found the
Unocal patent valid and that the defendants had infringed upon it in
their refining processes. The jury awarded damages of $0.0575 per
infringing gallon. Unocal received a payment of $69 million plus
accrued interest and some attorneys' fees in June 2000 for
infringement from March through July, 1996. About 29% of the RFG
gasoline manufactured by the defendants during that period infringed
on the '393 patent. The jury decision was upheld by an Appeals Court
in May 2000. In February of 2001, the Supreme Court declined to hear
the case. License agreements have been signed with 8 companies for
the 5 patents that Unocal holds for cleaner burning gasoline
compositions. Earlier this year, Unocal introduced a uniform
licensing program that specifies a range of between $0.12 and $0.34
per gallon for volumes that fall under the Unocal patents. The rate
per gallon is reduced as more utilization occurs.

ExxonMobil May Withdraw Bid for China Pipeline Project

    ExxonMobil is considering pulling out of talks to build a $5 
billion natural gas pipeline in China. The withdrawal would leave
Royal Dutch/Shell Group as the only major foreign oil company taking
part in the project and may affect its funding. The 4,000-kilometer
pipeline, China's longest, is part of a $14 billion plan to transport
reserves in the northwestern province of Xinjiang to Shanghai.

Judge Recuses Himself in Unocal Patent Case

Unocal has said that a US District Court Judge recused himself from
the case involving infringement on the its '393 gasoline patent due
to his discovery that he had a financial interest in one of the
parties involved. The case will be returned for reassignment. In
October, the judge granted the company's motion for summary judgment
requesting an accounting of infringement of its '393 cleaner burning
gasoline patent by 5 refiners. However, a written judgment had not
been issued. Further proceedings in the case will now be considered
by the new judge. The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield,
Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil and Shell. In 1997, a jury found the
Unocal patent valid and that the defendants had infringed upon it in
their refining processes. The jury awarded damages of $0.0575 per
infringing gallon. Unocal received a payment of $69 million plus
accrued interest and some attorneys' fees in June 2000 for
infringement from March through July, 1996. About 29% of the RFG
gasoline manufactured by the defendants during that period infringed
on the '393 patent. The jury decision was upheld by an Appeals Court
in May 2000. In February of 2001, the Supreme Court declined to hear
the case. License agreements have been signed with 8 companies for
the 5 patents that Unocal holds for cleaner burning gasoline
compositions. Earlier this year, Unocal introduced a uniform
licensing program that specifies a range of between $0.12 and $0.34
per gallon for volumes that fall under the Unocal patents. The rate
per gallon is reduced as more utilization occurs.

Oilfield Services Most Volatile Stocks in Energy Sector

    Oilfield service stocks, which often climb or fall by 5% or more
one day, then swing in the other direction the next day, are the most
volatile group within the energy sector. Energy stocks are among the
most unpredictable in the US stock market, shifting along with oil
and natural gas prices that can soar or sink with a sudden change in
the weather. In the category of energy stocks, oilfield services can
be the most unstable because their earnings are tied to the ups and
downs of drilling activity. When companies lower their drilling
activity, equipment and service companies do not get hired but still
have many fixed costs. The upstream oil and natural gas exploration
and production business is the next most volatile sector of the
energy industry, with integrated oil companies being the most stable
because their refining and marketing operations can counteract their
upstream business. In 1998 oil prices dropped from $17.60 to about
$12 and the Philadelphia stock exchange's oil service index fell 55%
while the S&P oil and gas exploration and production index tumbled
39%. The S&P index of integrated oil companies climbed 6% that year.
The next year, oil prices rebounded to $25.60 per barrel and oil
service stocks jumped by 67%, the upstream sector rose 17% and
integrated oils increased 15%. Last year, contrary to the law of
averages, natural gas prices sky-rocketed to $9.80 per Mcf and
upstream endeavors gained 57% while oil services rose 45% and
integrated oils climbed 6%. In a stock rating system, values above 1
indicate greater risk for volatility, values below 1 show lower than
average volatility. Several oil field service companies have ratings
as high as 1.7, while ExxonMobil is rated 0.4. Some analysts say that
investors could see a potential upside next year by moving away from
the relative safety of the major integrated oil companies towards
more volatile energy stocks.

Your Inspiration:  Treasures

There are treasures in life,
but owners are few
Of money and power
to buy things brand new.

Yet you can be wealthy
and feel regal too,
If you will just look
for the treasures in you.

These treasures in life
are not hard to find
When you look in your heart,
your soul, and your mind.

For when you are willing
to share what's within,
Your fervent search
for riches will end.

The joy and the laughter,
the smile that you bring;
The heart unafraid
to love and to sing;

The hand always willing
to help those in need;
Ones quick to reach out,
to labor and fee.

So thank you for sharing
these great gifts inside;
The caring, the cheering,
the hug when one cried.

Thanks for the energy,
encouragement too,
And thank you for sharing
the treasures in you.

"Maintenance Window-Saturday, Oct 27","While you may have read in the Change Control email sent today from the ETS Solution Center, we have some changes on the 41st floor scheduled for this weekend during the maintenance window.  While we do not expect any problems with this maintenance window, we need to make sure we have a plan in place to not impact the customers. 

This Saturday night,  October 27, starting at 10:30 pm fiber maintenance will be performed in the wiring closet on EB41.  During this maintenance window the jacket that covers and protects the fiber will be pulled back tight and secured.  This fiber connects the 41st floor wiring closet with the server room on 41, where the TMS servers are located.   While we do not expect this maintenance to have any impact, if we do have any issues with the fiber it can be replaced within an estimated 2 hour window.  Outage impact would then be lose of connectivity with the Enron LAN from that server room, therefore TMS would be unavailable.  

At 10:30 pm on Saturday night, Mark Cowley from the server team will contact the HotTap Helpdesk to get approval to start the maintenance window.  The maintenance window will not begin until all processing for the pipelines is complete.  If we have any problems or issues he will contact me and I will start the escalation process.    

If you have any questions, please feel free to give me a call.   Thanks.  Jean x51615

"RE: Northern vs. Oneok:  Oneok measurement settlement","Charlie sent me the following message.
""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

"DMI, PD and ETS Infrastructure Prevents","
ETS continues working to solidify the security of our environment.  Several projects are underway which I wanted you to know about.  I also wanted to report incidents ETS' infrastructure prevented that did not cause any business interruption and/or lost revenue.

Desktop Management Initiative (DMI)

We are working with Simon Burgess of Enron Net Works on this desktop management initiative.  ETS leverages Enron Net Works for the scripted delivery of applications to our workstations and laptops.  Given the 1,700+ workstations in ETS' environment, it is rather easy to quantify the value received by leveraging this ENW service.  If you consider the number of applications in our environment that would require visits to each workstation or laptop for installation, the $'s add up quickly in costs that we avoid.  DMI will add additional value to ENW's service of scripted application delivery.  Software metering and Application Management are the main two components delivered by this initiative.  Upon completion, support costs are expected to be reduced and the turnaround time for distributing software packages will be faster.

Project Defender (PD)

Project Defender differs from DMI.  Within PD, we are looking at the configuration settings of all ETS workstations and servers.  Once we validate a workstation or server is a supported ETS asset, we compare it's configuration against published minimum supported standards and report exceptions.  The minimum supported standards are comprised of Corporate mandated standards and ETS required standards for the protection of our environment.  Any exceptions are reported and remedied.

An article in ETS' IT Newsletter describes more about Project Defender.  http://www.ets.enron.com/ITNewsletter/projects/projectdefender112001.asp

These are just 2 of many projects Infrastructure has underway to help improve the stability, reliability and security of our environment.  Look for more communication next month on the continuous improvements being made on connectivity to Omaha and our overall Business Continuity/DR process.

INFRASTRUCTURE PREVENTS

During the month of October, there were two (2) incidents that confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance and pro-active response tools.  These incidents could have had a serious impact to our business, so I thought it important to communicate them and how they were handled which prevented any business impact.

TMS (Throughput Management System)

ETS currently has an EMC disk array that supports some components of the TMS application.  This disk array is targeted for decommission by December 1st, 2001.  The disk array presents four (4) single points of failure for components of the TMS application it supports.  Once decommissioned, these four (4) single points of failure will no longer exist in ETS' environment.

During the week of 10/15, the EMC disk array had 2 power supply failures at the same time.  The array has three (3) total power supplies, so the single, remaining power supply assumed the load while the other power supplies were in a failed state.  The disk array phoned (via internal modem) its support center which in turn, notified our server on-call support member.  Within 4 hours of supply failures, 2 new power supplies were installed in the disk array bringing all 3 power supplies back on-line and in a desired fail over state.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.

RMS (Revenue Management System)
One of the mirrored drives on our production RMS application server (GTHOU-WWRMS01P) failed.  The drive was part of a mirrored set.  Upon failure, the mirrored drive assumed the server load and our Insight Management application reported the failed drive to our server team.  Within 2 hours, the failed drive was replaced.   The drive pair was again in a mirrored state within 6 hours.  There was no impact to business processes or end users.

These are 2 examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents.  I believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of crisis.

Thanks,
-Scott.

Of course I'm happy to serve. The best for me would be Wednesday afternoon beginning at 2 or 2:30. I will already be in Omaha. I could also do it Thursday morning early---I have to leave by 10:00 a.m. Lynn is out of town until next Wednesday, but  I'm sure she will be checking her e:mails. thanks. sj

Subject:	SLA Settlement



As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

"Summary of Commission Meeting","At the October 24, 2001, FERC Sunshine meeting, the following items were discussed:

Kern River Firm Customers' Rehearing Request Denied (C-6, C-8 on agenda):

Called by Linda Breathitt, these are two Kern River expansion applications [CA. Action Project, CP01-69; 2002 Expansion, CP01-106] that have received certificates.  The draft orders deny rehearing requests by Firm Customers who charge that additions will cause further  pro rata allocations at Wheeler Ridge.  The draft order states that the benefits of the project outweigh ""any potential adverse impact to existing customers?"" and that ""the solution to the problem of pro rata curtailments at Wheeler Ridge lies not with interstate pipelines, but with resolving the problems of take-away capacity on SoCalGas?.""  Hence, the orders reason that Kern River has satisfied its obligations to its customers, and the current lack of intrastate capacity ""cannot be laid at [Kern River's] door.""

Breathitt is filing concurrences to these two orders to highlight the important issue of FERC's response to intervener allegations of insufficient take-away capacity related to interstate expansions.  Though Breathitt doesn't dissent from the rehearing denial, she wants to underscore the importance of the Commissions' acknowledgement of the role that possible degradation of existing rights plays in the determination of the public need and necessity for pipeline expansions.  She also states that she is ""uneasy"" about FERC's ""strident policies"" in favor of adding pipeline facilities despite possible inefficiencies and constraints, and she reiterates that FERC's mandate under the NGA goes beyond making sure pipeline gets into the ground.  She notes that the Commission will revisit the take-away capacity issue in another Kern River expansion application, CP01-422 [2003 Expansion Project].

Brownell Calls for Development of Regional State Relations Panels under Auspice of ""Electricity Market Design and Structure"" NOPR, RM01-12 (E-5 on agenda)

Though  the issuance of a NOPR is not apparently imminent, under this discussion item Nora Brownell announced that she has sent a memo to the other three Commissioners recommending the development of some internal structure to coordinate communications between FERC and state commissions.  The need for such coordination emerged from obvious frustration expressed by state commissioners during RTO Week.  To get this process going, Commissioner Brownell asked staff to pursue a structure, perhaps a type of regional panel, with the mission to strengthen federal/sate relationships.  Considering the magnitude of RTO development, FERC likely will need to have dedicated staff work on this.  Chairman Wood requested that Dan Larcamp, Director of OMTR, bring a proposal to the Commission at the next meeting on how to implement a structure.  While all three other Commissioners supported Brownell's proposal, Commissioner Massey noted that there's already been seven years of ""process"" and input on RTO formation and that any new structure should be developed ""in a way that gets us to an endgame"" concretely and clearly.

Western Infrastructure Reports Lay Baseline for FERC Adequacy Conference in Seattle

Staff presented multiple detailed reports on data and background material gathered to lay the groundwork for discussions at next month's Western Infrastructure Adequacy Conference in Seattle on November 2 [similar conferences will be held regionally across the country].    The conference is a FERC ""fact-finding mission"" which will seek to answer three primary questions:
(1)		Is the current energy infrastructure in the West adequate?
(2)	What are the infrastructure needs for the region?
(3)	What factors inhibit investment in the development of adequate energy infrastructure?

While the presentations seem to focus primarily on electric transmission, the conference will cover all energy delivery systems.  The overriding question on all fronts is what needs to be done, and who needs to do it.  The powerpoint presentations made by Staff are already available on FERC's website at <http://www.ferc.gov/calendar/commissionmeetings/discussion_papers.htm>
 
""RTO Week"" Update 

Staff updated the Commissioners and public on the week of RTO panels held at FERC last week.  Staff is preparing and organizing a document outlining ""what Staff heard,"" which will be posted on FERC's website this week.  The document is intended to give focus to reply comments from stakeholders.  Staff also suggested that there may be a need to hold smaller, more focused Staff sessions to ""dig deeper?.""  According to Staff, while there seemed to be some consensus at the 10.000 mile high level, more specific issues emerged which may require further discussion.

Lengthy Updates and Discussion on Two RTO Mediations (Southeast, Northeast), Midwest RTO Progress

In the Northeast and Southeast RTO mediation cases, Staff and the mediating Judges briefed the Commissioners on where the ordered mediations left off, what proposals and options are now on the table, and what next steps may be necessary.  These mediation reports will be available online (by end of week).  What is not clear is when the Commission is going to vote on RTOs - there were no votes at the meeting, only discussion.

In the Midwest, both MISO and ARTO are ready for operations, and MISO and SPP are also prepared to merge.  While Commissioners discussed specifics of all the Midwest proposals, again no vote was taken or any indication given as to when a vote may occur.

ETS Draft Orders Issued:

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

"Wire and Check Request","When Lynn and Steve were both gone at the same time this week we realized that we needed to have another plan in place for getting wire and check requests signed by Rick who is located on 39.  So what we have decided to do if that happens again is to first, make sure that the teams know that Lynn and Steve will be gone and second, we will set up a basket in my office where you can drop your wire or check requests off and then either Josh or myself will get them down to Rick for his signature and then back to you.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

"RE: City of Duluth, #106706","Update:  This morning I visited with Laura Rupp to check on the status of this payment and she reported this was sent 12/21.  This afternoon I received a check from BP Canada in the amount of $5,443.08 which represents payment in full for these PPAs.  This should clear City of Duluth's A/R.

I cannot believe I am so excited about getting money I have no control over!

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.  

Nice way to start a Monday!

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

Subject:	RE: New Contracts - activitated mid month


All,
our research has yielded a data problem as the cause of K5997 not showing up on the MTD Market Summary Report.  We are working with DBAs to get this resolved.

Just one question, from the contents of the original note, it is not quite clear whether the stated problem manifested on MTD and daily Market Summary reports or just the MTD.

As a side note, I went and looked in Remedy but did not find any ticket for this problem.  Also, I noticed that no one on the TMS support team was copied on the original email.  I would like to strongly encourage everyone to use the TMS production problem reporting procedures that we have in place.

thanks

Subject:	New Contracts - activitated mid month



	We have a new contract for Southern Company K5997 that was activitated effective 12/20/01.  The shipper
	nominated their gas also for the first time on this contract for the 12/20/01 gas day.

	This contract is NOT showing up on our MTD Market Summary or the 12/20 Market Summary?????

	We had  a similar problem right after CMS went into production with another contract; however this one

	appeared on the daily Market Summary; but not the MTD one????

	What type of procedure or fix do we need to implement between CMS/TMS to insure that all contracts

	that are new or newly activitated  mid month bridge over to TMS reports?????

	Suggestions???? Help????

	Thanks Lynda

Crude Oil Futures Rally on Anticipated OPEC Cut

Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX climbed $1.65 to
$21.27 per barrel yesterday in its biggest gain in over a year amid
signs that OPEC will proceed with plans to cut production by 1.5
million bpd in a bid to lift sagging crude prices. To avoid losing
market share, the cartel had demanded that non-OPEC producers
contribute a cut of 500,000 bpd between them before it would make any
further slices in its own production. So far, Russia, Mexico, Norway,
Oman and Angola have committed to a combined 462,500 curb in exports,
which appears to be enough to allow OPEC to go ahead with their
plans. The ministers are scheduled to meet in Cairo on Friday and are
expected to take that opportunity to announce their cut. The IEA
projects that world demand will rise by 600,000 bpd next year, about
30% below the average annual gain during the 1990's, as the largest
oil consumers, the US and Japan are mired in a recession. The CFTC
has reported that traders sold more crude oil futures contracts on
the NYMEX than they bought in the week ended December 18th, producing
the highest net short position levels since the contracts began
trading in 1983. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the
NYMEX jumped $0.0462, or 8.4%, to $0.5946 per gallon as colder
weather arrived in most of the eastern portion of the US. The
increase in heating oil was the biggest gain since last April.
January gasoline futures on the NYMEX rose $0.0427 to $0.6013 per
gallon. In London, the IPE was closed in observance of Boxing Day.

World Heating Fuel Projections


    The eastern half of the US will continue to experience colder
weather for the next several days resulting in strong heating fuel
consumption. Temperatures are expected to be 8 to 16 degrees below
average from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic region southward
to the Gulf of Mexico. New England, the upper Midwest and the
northern Plains will be a little milder than normal, but heating fuel
demand will remain higher than usual. Mild weather is expected
throughout the western states decreasing demand for heating fuel. In
Canada, above normal temperatures into early January will keep
heating fuel consumption lower than normal. A cool-weather bias will
remain in far southeastern Canada for the several days producing
above normal demand for heating fuels. Milder weather in western
Europe will significantly reduce heating fuel consumption during the
next 7 to 10 days. In the UK and France, temperatures will be close
to normal through January 5th. Germany and eastern Europe will
experience colder temperatures, but some reduction in heating fuels
demand will occur. Temperatures in Scandinavia will average from 4 to
8 degrees Celsius below normal producing strong heating oil
consumption through early January. China's weather will continue to
be colder than usual, with temperatures expected to average from 4 to
8 degrees Celsius below normal for the next 10 days. Japans usage of
heating fuel is projected to higher than normal through January 5th.
Most of the country will be 2 to 5 degrees Celsius below average.

Saudi Minister Says OPEC to Announce Cuts in Cairo

    Comments made by the Saudi oil minister seem to indicate that
OPEC is ready to go ahead with a planned production cut of 1.5
million bpd after receiving commitments from non-member producers to
also reduce exports. The minister said that OPEC would announce the
reductions at a meeting in Cairo on Friday. The remarks put an end to
a threatened price war between the cartel and non-OPEC producers. The
cartel had accused the non-aligned producers of taking advantage of
curbs already implemented this year by OPEC to grab a larger share of
the market. The cartel had demanded that the non-member producing
countries trim 500,000 bpd from exports before it would once again
slice production. To date Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and Angola
have pledged cuts totaling 462,500 bpd, which appears to be enough to
convince OPEC to proceed with its cut. The ministers also seem to be
comfortable with the level of commitment by the non-members to stick
to their quotas for the specified 6-month period. The new
restrictions will lower exports for 10 OPEC producers to 21.7 million
bpd, down 5 million bpd or 19% from a year ago, the lowest level in
10 years. Iraq, the 11th member produces at will because of UN
sanctions. The new supply limits are designed to lift prices back to
$20-$25 per barrel for the basket of OPEC crude oils.

Philadelphia Oil Service Index Climbs to August Levels

    The Philadelphia Oil Service Index climbed as high as 89.85, its
highest level since August, closing at 89.41, up 3.8% yesterday.
Shares of Rowan added $0.77 to $19.70 and Schlumberger stocks gained
$2.85 to $55.95. Integrated oil stocks also gained, as the CBOE Oil
Index was up 1.3% to 300.2. ChevronTexaco rose $0.65 to $89.20 and
ExxonMobil advanced $0.60 cents to $39.60. On the NYMEX, February
crude oil rose to session high at $21.43 per barrel, its highest
level in 6 weeks. It closed at $21.27, up $1.65, or 8.6%.
Expectations that OPEC will proceed with a planned production cut of
1.5 million bpd at a meeting in Cairo on Friday likely gave the
market a lift. Although non-OPEC producers are a little short of the
500,000 bpd reduction that OPEC demanded, it appears that they came
close enough, with a combined pledge to cut 462,500 bpd, to satisfy
the cartel.

Egypt Increases Oil Reserves

    Egypt's Oil Ministry says new oil and condensate finds with
recoverable reserves of 178 million barrels, and natural gas reserves
of 1.5 Tcf have been discovered. About 15 wells had been drilled, of
which 7 were now producing at a total of 16,000 bpd.  The oil
discoveries were made in the Gulf of Suez and the country's western
and eastern deserts, and the natural gas discoveries were made in the
Nile Delta area, western desert and in the Mediterranean sea. Egypt
produced about 640,000 barrels of oil per day in November. It has
proven natural gas reserves of 53.3 Tcf, and oil reserves of 3.8
billion barrels.

UDS Refinery Restart Delayed

    Ultramar Diamond Shamrock has run into problems trying to restart
the fluid catalytic cracker at its Golden Eagle refinery near San
Francisco following scheduled maintenance work. The catalytic cracker
and an alkylation unit had to be closed down, contributing to a rise
in wholesale gasoline prices in the area. A new attempt to restart
the FCC is expected today. UDS announced in November that it had
shutdown the FCC at the 170,000 bpd refinery for scheduled
maintenance work and that would be followed by maintenance work on
the hydrocracker at the same refinery. Wholesale CARB gasoline prices
in San Francisco rose by over $0.04 per gallon yesterday.

Taiwan Deregulates Oil Market

     Taiwan's economics ministry has announced the full opening of
the oil market to foreign-refined products, heaping pressure on state-
run giant Chinese Petroleum Corp to speed up deregulation. The
privatization of Taiwan's oil products came after passage of the oil
management law in September, which would open the floodgates to
imports of gasoline, diesel and kerosene, and expand the island
nation's already crowded energy market. After the opening, any
company, which has facilities to store 60 days of reserves or 50
million liters of the oil products, is allowed to buy them from
foreign refiners, said the Energy Commission. In 1999, the government
cut restrictions on imports of jet fuel, fuel oil and LPG as part of
its drive to meet requirements for entry into the WTO. The complete
deregulation was set to further erode market share of dominant
supplier CPC. CPC, faced with a saturated domestic market and
increasing competition, will have to accelerate its privatization or
see a further erosion of dominance in the local oil market. CPC says
it plans to sell as much as a 50% stake overseas in the second half
of 2002.

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

"Bushton Treater Plant","

FYI,

I got a call form Larry at Bushton. He said they having trouble with a pump in the treater plant. They haven't received the spare pump yet, so there could be a possibility that the treater plant could be down this weekend. Which means Lyons would be down. They just wanted to give us a heads up, so we can figure this in our weekend plan.

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

"Enron Kids Adopt A Child Program","


 For each of the last 15 years the Enron Kids Committee has chosen an under-privileged HISD elementary school and offered to ""sponsor"" every child in that school.  What we mean by ""sponsor"" is that we outfit the child from head to toe plus give each of them a toy and book.  The presents are then handed out to the children at their school Holiday Party in December.  For most of these kids, it is their only Christmas present.

I am once again coordinating the volunteer / adoption efforts for ETS.  Some ETS departments and employees have already sponsored a child-- thanks for your support.  But thus far, we have only adopted 216 of 468 children.  We need more help!!!!

If you would like to participate, I will coordinate collections and adoptions.  Simply reply back to this email with the amount you would like to contribute.  It costs about $100 to ""sponsor"" each child.  Last year we were able to adopt 18 children. 

All the funds collected will be matched by the Enron Foundation.  The matching funds will be used to buy books and computers for the school.   I will also need volunteers for shopping.  If you would like to shop for the kids we sponsor, please let me know.

Thanks for your support!!

"FW: Visit to NNG","Donna/John
 
Greg will be coming to visit Monday, October 22nd, and in addition to the day-to-day activity we do with MOPS, he is interested in talking about the services we can provide during the interim transition period.  I will be in Lubbock that day, so could one of you be the contact for Greg to call when he gets here?  
 
Donna, Sarabeth has provided the base services agreement to us, so we do have a document to start with, but we still need to find out from Williams what specifically they want us to do. We also need to be aware of the issues Rita has brought up regarding system enhancements that would be necessary to capture bifurcated rates, change the invoice template, provide ad hoc reports to Williams, etc. Sarabeth was deliberate in pointing out that the services agreement did not contemplate assuming liabilities greater than the value of the contract.  In the event Williams requires higher levels of liability, (more than $10,000/mo) we can purchase insurance, and the cost of the premium would be added to our fees.
 
I'll let you know times when I learn of Greg's travel arrangements.
 
Thanks, Bob

"RE: SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding","I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about ""Shipper Imbalances"" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order (""OFO"") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

Enron Credit Line -2: Secured By Northern Natural Gas

11/21/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Co. (ENE) closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines and said it is in active discussions to restructure its debt to improve liquidity. 
In a press release Wednesday, Enron said the $450 million credit facility is secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co. 
A $550 million credit facility, secured by the assets of Enron's Transwestern Pipeline Co., closed Nov. 16. The proceeds are being used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations. 
The company said the maturity on its $690 million note payable obligation will be extended to mid-December. 
Dow Jones Corporate Filings Alert reported Monday that Enron is currently preparing a restructuring plan aimed at taking aggressive steps to rationalize the company's existing cost structure, accelerating the process of divesting noncore businesses and assets and restructuring scheduled maturities of debt and other obligations. 



The Death Of A Pipedream
Pamela Williams

Some of the biggest names in Washington have been long associated with the dream of opening up the rich energy fields to rival Gulf oil. But the war in Afghanistan has killed off one of the most ambitious projects. 
The web site of the US oil giant, Unocal, tells a tale of corporate power in hiding. It is a blunt statement of repudiation, far from the covetous plans of the 1990s for crossing Afghanistan with pipelines rich with oil and gas. 
Instead, in an admission of defeat, the company has posted the message: ``Unocal does not have nor do we plan to have any projects in Afghanistan. We do not support the Taliban in any way whatsoever.'' 
Hailed as the biggest single economic event of the 21st century with more oil and gas than Saudi Arabia's fabled reserves the project was a multi-billion dollar pipeline, bringing gas from the prime Turkmenistan reserves, across Afghanistan, to the huge Indian and Pakistan markets. Another pipeline would have carried oil from the Caspian reserves. 
But in 1998, the project faced defeat as the civil rights and feminist lobby in the United States took on the oil giants over the suppression of human rights by the fervent Islamic clerics and mullahs of the Taliban. They wrested the attention of the United Nations and forced the hand of then president Bill Clinton. Notwithstanding years of pressure by Unocal and its star-studded array of consultants, Clinton declared that the Taliban's repression of women's rights meant there could be no recognition of the Government in Kabul. 
It was a bitter blow for Unocal. 
But now, with the Taliban steadily being blasted from power, there is renewed speculation that Unocal might seek to breathe new life into the project, bringing a new frenzy of lobbyists and consultants from the US oil industry into the broken Afghan capital. 
Absolutely not, according to Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane. He rejects outright the suggestion that Unocal never gave up the pipeline dream, and pressured new President George W. Bush to re-open the door to the Taliban earlier this year. 
``Why would we want to go back in there,'' Lane demands. ``In the intervening three years since we pulled out, our company has refocused its interests.'' 
Furthermore, he insists that Unocal never cut deals with the Taliban in the first place. He is keen to paint the company (which is a major donor to the Republican Party), as having moved on to greener pastures. 
``It [the Afghanistan pipeline proposal], had all the earmarks of a very good project. But there was no recognised government and therefore you could not get finance, so the project could not go forward,'' Lane says. ``And we were always an advocate on women's rights and we pressured them [the Taliban] at the time,'' he insists. That's not the way the very influential US lobby group The Feminist Majority remembers it. This organisation rallied women and trade unions across America, and galvanised Hollywood to rally for Afghan women's rights. In the end, the Clintons buckled. 
Spokeswoman for The Feminist Majority, Kathy Spillar, says: ``The whole world was willing to look the other way as this Taliban regime stripped women of every human right except to breathe, while it planned on how to exploit these oil interests. Now the eyes of the world are on what this new government will look like. And we're going to be watching the oil interests closely. There are just too many times these brutal regimes have flourished while business interests look the other way.'' 
The speculation about the continued pressure by oil companies on US foreign policy in Afghanistan has been fed by the publication of a new book which alleges that the oil giants stayed George W's hand on investigating terrorism this year while they tried one last round of diplomacy to secure some concessions from the Taliban. 
In Bin Laden: the Forbidden Truth, by Jean-Charles Brisard and Guillaume Dasquie, the authors claim that under pressure from US oil companies, George W. Bush's Administration blocked intelligence agencies from investigating terrorism while it bargained with the Taliban to give up Osama bin Laden in exchange for political recognition and economic aid. 
The authors claim that US oil companies and the US relationship with oil-rich Saudi Arabia were the two greatest obstacles to hunting Islamic terrorists. And they assert that until August this year, the US goal was actually to consolidate the Taliban in the hope of finally striking the lucrative pipeline deals. 
According to the book, the US re-opened negotiations with Taliban representatives in February this year meetings that continued until August, just a month before New York's World Trade Center was attacked. 
The authors claim as their source for this extraordinary revelation, the former deputy director of the FBI, John O'Neill, who for many years led the FBI investigations into Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network. 
They say that O'Neill this year complained bitterly that his investigations into bin Laden were blocked by the State Department and the oil lobby connected to President George W Bush. In frustration, O'Neill resigned from the FBI. In a chilling turn of events, he took a new job as head of security at the World Trade Center. He was killed on September 11 in the attack on the twin towers. 
Certainly the top layers of George W. Bush's Administration enjoy excellent relations with the American oil giants. Aside from the Bush family's oil background, Vice-President Dick Cheney was until last year the chief executive of energy services giant, Halliburton; the National Security Adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was a director of Chevron through the 1990s, and the Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, Donald Evans and Spencer Abraham, worked for oil company Tom Brown. And Unocal includes on its board of directors, Donald Rice, who was Secretary of the Air Force under the first president Bush. 
In its efforts to secure a pipeline deal with the Taliban in recent years, Unocal went to extraordinary lengths. 
With consultants on board such as the former US Ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, the company pursued all opportunities, including donating nearly $US1million to the University of Nebraska to the school of Afghanistan Studies. The money was used in part to set up training programs for Afghans who would work on the pipeline, should Unocal end up in the box seat with the Taliban. 
Taliban mullahs visited the US twice, with representatives travelling to Houston in late 1997 as the guests of Unocal, visiting the home of Unocal boss Marty Miller, enjoying the sights, with trips to the zoo and shopping centres. On the side there were talks with the State Department. 
All the while, intense fighting raged across Afghanistan between the warlords and the Taliban and amongst the warlords themselves. 
The CentGas project, as the Unocal consortium (with its major partner the Saudi company Delta Oil), was known, had to raise its funds by late 1997 to meet its deadlines. But the fighting made it impossible to envision stability and finally the CentGas consortium began to unravel. 
The stakes for the oil giant were huge. In February 1998, Unocal's vice-president of international relations, John Maresca, testified before the House Committee on International Relations. Maresca too, was from the family fold, having been George Bush Snr's Ambassador to Cyprus. 
He outlined the glittering prospects if only the centre could be made to hold in Afghanistan. Despite two decades of bitter warfare and the suppression of human rights, Afghanistan was still the best option for Unocals' pipelines as far as the company was concerned. 
``The route through Afghanistan is the one that would bring Central Asian oil closest to Asian markets and thus would be cheapest in terms of transporting the oil,'' Maresca said. 
And to bring gas, there was the CentGas pipeline. 
But as with the oil pipeline, construction could not begin ``until an internationally recognised Afghanistan government was in place. For the project to advance, it must have international financing, government-to-government agreements and government-to-consortium agreements.'' 
Four weeks later, Bill Clinton, with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright by his side, dispatched Unocal's hopes, declaring there would be no diplomatic recognition for the Taliban. 
In his best-selling book, Taliban, Ahmed Rashid, quoted Yasushi Akashi, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs speaking in 1996: ``The outside interference in Afghanistan is now all related to the battle for oil and gas pipelines. The fear is that these companies and regional powers are just renting the Taliban for their own purposes.'' 
The Taliban may now be all but gone, but the oil and gas reserves in the region mean that Afghanistan has by no means reached the end of its long march with the US oil giants. 



Pipeline projects flourish

11/23/2001 
Tulsa World 
FINAL HOME EDITION

Tulsa-based Williams Cos. Inc., El Paso Corp. and other domestic energy firms are leading a $2 billion-a-year expansion of natural- gas pipelines in the United States, the biggest since the 1960s. 
Spurred by a projected 30 percent rise in demand for gas in the next nine years, pipeline companies are building projects that will snake their way from the Great Plains to California, and from Canada to New York. 
Falling gas prices and a weakening economy haven't slowed construction. El Paso recently said it plans to spend as much as $1.8 billion on a 750-mile line to bring gas to New York from Nova Scotia, and Duke Energy Corp. announced a $478.1 million expansion of a Canadian line to Boston. 
""We're looking through the short-term cycle,"" said Stephen Beasley, president of El Paso's Tennessee Gas Pipeline unit. ""We're in a transition from a petroleum to a natural-gas economy. If you're building a new boiler, a new home, a new power plant, the principal fuel is natural gas."" 
Houston-based El Paso owns 58,000 miles of interstate pipeline, the biggest U.S. network. 
Since 1997, federal regulators have granted construction certificates for 60 onshore and offshore projects that would add 8,110 miles of pipeline with the capacity to move an extra 23.2 billion cubic feet of gas a day. The projects are valued at $10.7 billion. 
There are 24 additional projects, worth $4.4 billion, awaiting federal approval for an additional 8 billion cubic feet of capacity and 1,730 miles of pipeline. 
This year, about 17 pipeline projects are scheduled for completion, adding 5.5 billion cubic feet in daily capacity and 1,400 miles of new or upgraded pipeline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. 
The construction involves pipelines to new gas reserves, lines to new markets and line expansion to new customers, Beasley said. 
The United States has 185,0000 miles of interstate pipelines and 75,000 miles of distribution pipelines. The system can move about 22 trillion cubic feet of gas daily. 
Forecasts by the Interstate Natural Gas Association and DOE put 2010 demand close to 30 trillion cubic feet. 
Pipeline companies sell line capacity to gas users before starting construction, so the fall in gas prices this year isn't expected to halt construction. 
""These aren't the types of projects you do on speculation,"" said Cuba Wadlington, head of pipeline operations for Williams. ""We aren't selling gas -- we're selling capacity."" 
Williams, also one of the biggest energy traders, has a 27,300- mile pipeline network that spans North America. Its biggest project is a $1.6 billion joint venture with Duke Energy for a line from Alabama to Florida. The pipeline will run 700 miles and carry 1 billion cubic feet of gas. 
The company also is working on a $135 million expansion of its Kern River pipeline to California, and is spending $300 million to build a line to the Pacific Northwest from central Wyoming. 
Williams plans to spend an additional $6 billion in the next three years on pipeline projects, Wadlington said. The company also is part of a group that announced recently it will draw up a plan to build a pipeline for bringing Alaskan natural gas to markets in the ""lower 48"" states. 
The group expects to present a plan to the owners of Alaska's gas reserves and the state by the end of the year to build and run the line by 2008. 
Foothills Pipe Lines Ltd., a venture of TransCanada PipeLines Ltd. and Westcoast Energy Inc., owns the right of way to the route.

WASHINGTON (AP)--The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said Monday. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines. 
There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the U.S. and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90% of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions. 
The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 
""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined reliability."" 
The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed."" 
Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan. 
There are thousands of miles of natural gas and petroleum pipelines crossing North America, making protection of such lines difficult. Aerial monitoring of pipelines have increased and security has been intensified at pipeline pumping stations, according to industry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.



Enron Is Sued Over 401(k) Plan; Plaintiffs Seek $850M

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) was sued Monday in the latest of at least three purported employee class action suits the company faces over lost 401(k) retirement savings due to the recent collapse of the price of Enron stock. 
In a press release Monday, Eli Gottesdiener, a Houston attorney who filed the latest suit on behalf of employees, said it seeks $850 million in plan losses, in part because the company sold Enron stock to its employees knowing the price was artificially inflated. 
An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Unlike two similar, recently filed suits against Enron, the latest also contends that Enron offered the stock without the required prospectus. 
If proven, the sale without a prospectus ""give workers the automatic right to rescind their purchases and receive their money back with interest,"" Gottesdiener said in a statement. 
Enron ""locked down"" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19, to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed amid growing disclosures of financial problems. 
Earlier this month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. (DYN) offered to buy its far larger competitor in an all-stock deal that values Enron shares at $10.85 a piece, or about $9.2 billion. 
Enron later disclosed that its future earnings would be substantially less than expected and shares fell sharply. 
Enron currently trades at $4.05 a share, down from their 52-week high of $84.88 a share in December 2000. 
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plaintiffs by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP in Houston. A second was filed last week by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP.

MOU Signed for 1,700-mile Alaskan Gas Pipeline Project

11/26/2001 
Gas Processors Report 
(c) 2001 Phillips Business Information, Inc. 
A memorandum of understanding has been signed between subsidiaries of six U.S. companies and three Canadian firms to immediately begin developing a proposal to build a 1,700- mile natural gas pipeline being designed to transport Alaskan natural gas from the North Slope to Canada and the lower 48 by 2008. The companies are hoping to present a proposal to producers by year-end. If and when an agreement is reached with the producers, the companies will move forward with the Alaskan portion of the project. 
The U.S. companies involved in the project include Williams, Duke Energy, Sempra Energy International, Enron, PG&E Corp., El Paso Corp., while TransCanada PipeLines, Westcoast Energy and Foothills Pipe Lines represent the Canadian parties. The signing of the MOU is significant because it shows a renewed interest in eliminating the historic and other commercial roadblocks to building the project, according to our source. 
All of the companies are the original partners in the Alaskan Northwest Natural Gas Transportation Co., which was designed by the President and U.S. Congress to build and operate the Alaskan portion of the project in 1977. The companies dropped out of the project years ago, even though the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission had already received approval for the project. Numerous other federal permits for the construction and operation of the Alaskan Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS) are already in place. The statutory framework for the project provides for a quick approval of the remaining permits needed before construction can begin. 
""This is a big step forward in bringing Alaska's natural gas to markets in the Lower 48, said Alaska Senator Frank Murkowski. ""I always have believed that construction of an Alaskan gas transportation system to the Lower 48 is going to take the synergistic efforts of pipeline companies and the oil and gas production companies in cooperation with the State, the federal government and Canada. While this does not guarantee construction of a North Slope gas delivery system, it is a big step in the right direction."" 



Wall Street - Oil, oil, boil and trouble.

11/24/2001 
Financial Times - FT.com 
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved 
A short week on Wall Street appeared a very long week for the energy sector, an industry that has - in everything from oil to electricity - succeeded in delivering some stinging surprises to the US economy this year. 
Last Sunday, Conoco and Phillips Petroleum jolted merger and acquisition specialists out of their torpor with the year's biggest deal, a $35bn ""merger of equals"" to create the third-largest integrated energy company in the US and the sixth-largest in the world. 
Coincidentally, on Monday, ChevronTexaco feted the consummation of its merger with a New York analysts' meeting at which David O'Reilly, the combined group's chief executive, promised higher than expected annual savings of $1.8bn by 2003. 
Whether the sector needs another clumsy baptism - the fruit of Sunday's announcement will, inevitably, be saddled with the name ConocoPhillips - is not really at issue. Consolidation that began in the 1990s has left medium-sized energy companies such as Conoco and Phillips with little option but to combine resources for exploration and production in order to compete with ""super-majors"" such as ExxonMobil. 
Volatile oil prices - another story of the week - appear to add to the urgency of the combination, although James Mulva, Phillips's chairman and chief executive, denied that was a prime reason for consolidation. After all, the industry has learned to live with volatility. 
These are companies that, in just three years, have shrugged off concerns about what would happen if crude oil remained at $10 a barrel, and, at the other extreme, the possibility of crude lingering above $30. 
In the short term, the fate of stock prices in the sector may depend on Opec's ability to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat in its confrontation with Norway and, in particular, Russia over calls for a cut in oil output to underpin the world price. Oil stocks, as measured by the Philadelphia Oil Service index, have had a turbulent time since September 11, plummeting initially only to rally back to their levels before the terrorist attacks and then slump again as the wrangling between Opec and non-Opec oil producers burst into the open. 
ChevronTexaco, for one, seemed unperturbed by the stand-off. ""If you want a stable price environment, you don't want to be in this business,"" O'Reilly said on Monday. He was talking about the oil price but he might just as easily have been referring to energy stocks. 
Energy-related industries - from utilities to pipelines - make up six of the 10 worst-performing sectors over the past month, according to Dow Jones data analysed by CBS Marketwatch. 
None, however, has fallen as precipitously or as publicly as Enron, the energy trading company. Its share price at the close on Wednesday was $5.01, down 44 per cent on the week and 94 per cent below its 52-week high of nearly $85. Remember that this was a company that outperformed the Nasdaq Composite Index even as the technology-heavy index rose to its March 2000 peak. 
In addition, Enron remained at stratospheric price and valuation levels even after the dotcoms, whose magic dust its online trading operations borrowed, fell to earth. 
In the process, its ability to pioneer new trading markets, such as bandwidth, made it the envy of Wall Street's own broker-dealers, jealous of its trading bravado and its share rating. 
Two of Wall Street's giants - JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup - are now helping to prop up the group, laid low by its failure to disclose adequately off-balance-sheet transactions that it carried out as part of its rapid expansion. The two banks are advising Enron on a rescue bid from Dynegy, the much smaller rival energy group part-owned by ChevronTexaco, and backing it with $1bn of credit, secured on pipeline assets. 
The trigger for this week's sharp decline was Enron's regulatory filing late on Monday, which revealed for the first time to shaken shareholders and bondholders that the group would have to repay $690m of notes next Tuesday because of a downgrade 10 days ago by Standard & Poor's. 
Wednesday's announcement that Enron had managed to postpone that deadline until the middle of next month seemed to do little to allay the crisis of confidence about the group's ability to repay its heavy debts. Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, few share traders seemed to want to hold the stock, which fell 28 per cent on Wednesday alone, and electricity and gas counterparties are also wary of entering long-term contracts in the markets that Enron helped pioneer. 
The Enron debacle is a reminder of how quickly fortunes can change. Earlier this year, the well-connected and politically influential Houston-based group was powerful enough to be accused by Californians of playing a key role in provoking the electricity crisis on the west coast. 
Now Enron's shares and bonds are trading as though it may go bust. If it does, it could drag down other, weaker energy companies, because of its role as a market-maker, supplying liquidity to the power and gas markets. If the worst fears of some Wall Street bankers are realised there may even be repercussions for the wider financial markets, where Enron lays off the risk of price fluctuations, using derivatives.

Volatility Fell Slightly in Light Holiday Trading
As Enron Calls, Lilly Puts Attracted Interest
By Cheryl Winokur Munk

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -- The options market dozed, as many participants stayed home to recover from too much turkey and football. 
The Chicago Board Options Exchange's market volatility index, or VIX, which measures certain Standard & Poor's 100 Index option prices to gauge investor sentiment, remained in a tight range during the abbreviated trading session the day after Thanksgiving. It fell 0.53 to 24.79. 
VIX typically ranges between 20 and 30. A rise indicates traders and money managers are becoming anxious about the stock market; a fall shows investor optimism. 
Volatility has been dropping from post-Sept. 11 levels in recent weeks amid victories over the Taliban in Afghanistan and interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and other central banks. VIX ranged between 30 and 40 for several weeks following the attacks. 
Volatility is likely to remain low, said Mika Toikka, head of options strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. ""Typically, going into the Thanksgiving and December holidays, we tend to experience a seasonal drift lower in implied volatility. We would expect the same this year, especially in markets outside the U.S. where volatility is still lingering at high levels,"" Mr. Toikka wrote in a recent research note. 
The CBOE's Nasdaq Volatility index, or VXN, a sentiment barometer for the technology sector, fell 1.86 to 50.82 while the American Stock Exchange's Nasdaq volatility index, or QQV, dropped 1.03 to 42.74. 
Elsewhere in the options market: 
Calls in Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, continued to trade briskly, with one investor buying 10,000 January 5 calls and simultaneously selling 12,250 January 10 calls. 
More than 14,800 of the January 5 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 3,640, as shares fell 33 cents, or 6.6%, to $4.68. These calls cost $1.40 on the American Stock Exchange where most of the volume was traded. 
More than 15,000 of the January 10 contracts traded, compared with open interest of 30,674. These out-of-the-money calls cost 30 cents on the Amex. 
Eli Lilly & Co.'s December 80 out-of-the-money puts also were popular Friday, as shares fell 91 cents, or 1.1%, to $82.42. Morgan Stanley cut its rating on the company to neutral from outperform, saying the stock has become too expensive even with Food and Drug Administration approval of its potential blockbuster drug Xigris, which treats septic infections. More than 3,000 of these puts traded, compared with open interest of 6,427. They cost $1.25 on the CBOE, which saw much of the volume. 



War is the variable in the oil equation.
By IAN BREMNER.

11/26/2001 
Financial Times 
(c) 2001 Financial Times Limited . All Rights Reserved 
Oil prices are in the news again. Over the past two months, competition for market share and the threat of global recession have caused oil prices to plummet. Investors have regarded this as a positive development, since low energy prices can help resuscitate struggling western economies. 
However, the markets may be pricing the wrong end of the equation, for it is supply, not demand, that may prove a shock to the system. 
At issue is risk in the Middle East. As the war against terrorism moves beyond the Taliban, the US-led coalition will turn elsewhere to root out supporters of al-Qaeda and other terrorist networks. The top suspects are Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq - oil exporters with 45 per cent of the world's reserves among them. 
Pressure on these regimes to change their position on terrorism will mount in the coming months. But with the present governments in place, none is likely to do so. The Saudis and Iranians are unable, the Iraqis unwilling. 
While Saudi Arabia has been a military and economic ally of the US, its business and religious leaders have long supported the Taliban and al-Qaeda. Full co-operation with the investigations of September 11 and severance of the financial networks that supported it would critically expose the ruling family. 
Meanwhile, domestic opinion in Saudi Arabia runs counter to the interests of the US-led coalition. For Crown Prince Abdullah to maintain authority, he must take a far more radical stance against the US. Signs of Saudi intransigence have grown accordingly. Prince Abdullah stated that the US and Saudi Arabia should recognise and pursue their separate interests, and stepped up criticism of US policy on Palestine and Iraq. 
Iran's internal stability is also in doubt. Iran tops the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, through its continued support of Hamas and Hezbollah. President Mohammad Khatami would like to move his country towards the west; privately, his advisers hint that he is prepared to make significant concessions on the terrorism issue. But despite an overwhelming electoral victory for the reformers last June, authority remains in the hands of the Khamenei-led conservatives, who soften their stance at their peril. The political situation in Iran - where soccer riots have led to widespread anti-government demonstrations - leaves little room for compromise. 
Demographics work against both regimes. Rapidly expanding and extremely young populations have led to high unemployment and drastically diminished per capita income. Oil prices in the teens could not come at a worse time, guaranteeing crippling budget deficits and cutbacks on stretched social services. Together with pressure from the west, the position of both regimes is increasingly untenable. 
Saddam Hussein, Iraq's president, has little concern for domestic instability. But reports of Iraqi intelligence connections to the September 11 terrorists, coupled with Mr Saddam's alleged development of biological and chemical weapons, make it hard for the US to avoid escalation. President George W. Bush does not yet subscribe to the view of many in the defence department that Iraq should be the US's next military target, but pressure to remove Mr Hussein from power will undoubtedly increase. 
Further stirring the pot, the propaganda war is being lost by the US and the UK. Few in the Middle East feel any sympathy for Mr bin Laden, but the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular. Many are incensed by harm to Iraqi civilians over the issue of sanctions and by US support for Israel. As the war against terrorism moves closer to them, these feelings will intensify, further destabilising isolated regimes. 
The danger is not that Saudi Arabia or their neighbours will stop selling oil to the west on principle: their need for petrodollars is overwhelming. The risk is that one or more key oil producers will face a sudden crisis of government, disrupting the flow of oil. And there are other dangers, such as a terrorist attack on key refineries or pipelines. 
Nevertheless, few economists are seriously discussing the possibility of a jump in oil prices. They remain focused on prospects for recovery in the middle of next year. Significantly higher prices are far from certain, but $40 a barrel for any sustained period would damage or stall any recovery. 
Washington can do little to help. Using its strategic oil reserves is a possibility, as is exploiting new reserves in Alaska. Strategic discussions with Russia to keep supply high and increased flows from the Caspian would also help. 
Either way, a recovery is dependent upon maintaining stability in the Middle East. US fixes are simply nibbling around the edges.

Terror threat puts oil firms on alert-- Letter warns of attacks on installations, pipelines if bin Laden killed or captured
PETER KENNEDY

VANCOUVER -- Canada's oil-and-gas sector is on high alert after learning of a threat that associates of Osama bin Laden may be planning to sabotage energy installations and pipelines in North America. 
A spokesman for B.C. Gas Utility Ltd. confirmed yesterday that the company has received a copy of a warning it believes was distributed to about 400 members of the Washington, D.C.-based American Petroleum Institute last week. 
In a confidential letter, the institute said it had received information from a source of ""unde- termined reliability"" warning that an attack will take place if Mr. bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar is either captured are killed. 
The letter contained no details on who issued the warning, how such an attack would be carried out, or which facilities would be targeted. 
B.C. Gas spokesman Dean Pelkey said the warning may be the work of a prankster. ""But at the same time, when something like this comes out, you can't dismiss it out of hand,"" he said. 
""Since Sept. 11, we have increased security at our facilities and we are being more vigilant in watching and monitoring our pipelines. I think other oil-and-gas companies are likely doing the same,"" he said. 
Mr. Pelkey said he believes the confidential warning was sent to other Canadian members of API, which, according to its Web site, include Alberta companies Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada Ltd. 
Contacted yesterday, officials at Petro-Canada and Syncrude Canada said they were not aware of the warning. They said their security measures have been stepped up since the Sept. 11 attacks. 
Syncrude Canada spokeswoman Cherry Holland said the oil sands company's 3,700 employees have been told to wear personal identification tags at all times. 
A Petro-Canada official said the company has installed fencing and surveillance cameras around its Edmonton refinery. Company employees also need security cards to get in and out of Petro-Canada's office buildings. 
""We are cognizant of the events of Sept. 11, as terrible as they were, and it is certainly accurate to say that we are being very conscious of security measures lately,"" Petro-Canada spokesman Chris Dawson said. 
News of the warning comes just weeks after oil-patch representatives met with Alberta government officials to talk about security. 
At the meetings Sept. 28, Alberta Premier Ralph Klein said the government needs to see an inventory of what oil-and-gas sector projects around the province need increased security. He said government and industry need to co- ordinate their efforts. 
A spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers declined to discuss the API warning. 
""On matters like this we make absolutely no comment other than that all information we received is passed on to federal and provincial authorities,"" he said. 
About 40 per cent of U.S. oil-supply needs are met by Canadian producers, according to API's Web site. 



Dynegy Board Silent On Status Of Enron Takeover 
By Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- As the market continues to speculate about the status of Dynegy Inc.'s (DYN) takeover of Enron Corp. (ENE), Dynegy's board isn't offering its opinion. 
""Any comments coming out of Dynegy are coming from the company's executives,"" said Jerry Johnson, a Dynegy board member who also is an executive vice president at Safeguard Scientifics Inc. (SFE). 
Johnson declined to comment on any matters related the pending acquisition of its larger rival, and wouldn't say whether the board has been meeting to discuss the transaction. 
Three other board members, through their representatives, declined to comment as well. Other non-executive directors on the 14-member board either weren't immediately available to comment or couldn't be reached. 
As for Dynegy's management, spokesman John Sousa said the company's opinion on the deal remains the same since its last comments on Wednesday. 
At that time, Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said Dynegy was continuing its due diligence and was looking to accelerate regulatory approval of the deal. 
According to Sousa, Dynegy worked through the holiday weekend gathering information as part of its due diligence efforts. 
Meanwhile, Enron continued its discussions to raise between $500 million to $1 billion of additional financing, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne. The company also is working to restructure its debt by mid-December, she said. 
But investors appear to be voting with their feet. Enron shares were recently down 18.3%, or 86 cents, to $3.85, while Dynegy shares slipped 2.7%, or $1.06, to $39.34. As a result, the already huge discount to the deal's offer price has grown even bigger as the market continues to signal the deal won't get completed on its original terms. 
Under the terms of the transaction, Enron shareholders are to receive 0.2685 of a Dynegy share for each share outstanding, or about $8.98 billion, based on Dynegy's recent stock price. 
At Enron's recent level, the stock is trading at a 64% discount to the Dynegy offer. 
Neither Sousa or Denne would comment on the stock movement. 
Dynegy has already provided Enron with a $1.5 billion cash infusion that is secured by Enron's pipeline assets. While that investment has helped Enron's near-term liquidity position, it remains unclear how long the company can remain solvent without any added investments.

Enron, Banks Formalize $690M Debt Extension To Dec. 14
By Carol S. Remond and Christina Cheddar

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
Of Dow Jones Newswires 
   
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) and a group of banks last week formalized an agreement to extend the due date on a $690 million syndicated loan by three weeks to Dec. 14. 
The loan relates to one of Enron's consolidated limited partnerships that owns minority interests in power and energy projects around the world. Enron said last week that Standard & Poor's downgrade of its credit rating to ""BBB-"" had triggered an obligation to repay the loan by Nov. 27. 
People familiar with the matter said last week that lead banks J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. and Enron will use the extension to negotiate a further postponement of the debt to the middle of 2002 when other Enron bank loans come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured. 
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, those people familiar with the matter said. 
Enron's shares and bonds continue to suffer from mounting uncertainties about the company's finances and whether those could force one-time rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN) to reconsider its offer to buy Enron, an offer that many see as Enron's only chance to avoid bankruptcy. Enron stock was recently down 18% to $3.84. Meanwhile, Enron bonds are also lower, with the 6.4% bonds due 2004 recently trading at a distressed level of 48 cents on the dollar.

Another Sign Investors Don't Trust Enron
By Michael Rapoport

11/26/2001 
Dow Jones News Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 
A Dow Jones Newswires Column 
  
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- If you needed any further proof that investors no longer trust Enron Corp. (ENE), here's another piece of evidence - one that goes to the heart of the recent plunge in the company's stock. 
Enron doesn't simply trade for less than its book value; it fell below that milestone weeks ago. No, now it trades for less than ONE-THIRD of its book value. 
That's a rare level for a company of Enron's size and prominence. And it may mean, among other things, that investors have decided that they simply can't place any further faith in the veracity of Enron's earnings and balance-sheet figures, much-revised as they've been - something that has unnerving implications for any attempt to value the company fairly. 
First, let's be clear about what this means. Enron stock is currently about $4 a share; the company's reported book value is about $12.90 a share. In other words, Enron stock sells for less than one-third of what shareholders would get if the company were to liquidate - were to turn all its assets into cash, pay off all its liabilities on its balance sheet and give what's left over to shareholders. 
This is an uncommonly dismal level for any company, even a troubled one. For comparison's sake, Dynegy Inc. (DYN), which has agreed to buy Enron, trades at about three times book value, as does El Paso Corp. (EPG), a competitor of both companies. In fact, Enron has the second-lowest price-to-book ratio of any company in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index - only Conseco Inc. (CNC), another troubled company, is lower, by an eyelash. 
Part of the problem is undoubtedly the continuing fear among investors that Dynegy's agreement to buy Enron will fall apart, and the belief that Enron will have to file for bankruptcy if it does, in which case Enron shareholders would be hard-pressed to realize any value. The Dynegy deal now amounts to about $10.60 per Enron share, itself well under Enron's book value; the huge premium that level offers over Enron's current stock price is an indication of the big risk investors see that the deal won't be consummated in its current form. 
But given Enron's current woes, it's certainly also possible that Enron is trading at such a big discount to book value because investors don't feel they can trust the earnings and balance-sheet numbers coming out of Enron. Those numbers, after all, are the raw material that form the basis for valuing Enron, or any other company, by computing figures like price-to-book and price-to-earnings ratios. 
And the Enron debacle has been all about the quality of those numbers, with Enron shifting assets off its balance sheet to outside limited partnerships from which some of its executives benefitted. In terms of those numbers, the ground has shifted underneath investors three separate times now - when the company slashed its reported shareholder equity by $1.2 billion to unwind its transactions with one of those partnerships, when it restated nearly five years' worth of earnings downward by a total of $586 million, and when it revealed that it could take further charges and was facing an imminent deadline to post collateral on a $690 million note. (That deadline has now been extended until Dec. 14.) 
When you've gotten punched in the face three times, it's not unreasonable to fear there'll be a fourth blow, no matter how much the puncher assures you there won't be. Given Enron's insanely complicated structure, and the way bad financial news has dribbled out of the company over the past several weeks, who can guarantee there aren't more such shocks yet to come? 
That's what investors appear to be fearing, and that may be part of the reason Enron stock has fallen so precipitously. Thanks to Enron's repeated demonstrations that its numbers can't be relied on, investors no longer have a firm, trustworthy basis on which to value the stock. And so, not surprisingly, the value is getting ratcheted down to the most conservative, bare-minimum level. 
An Enron spokesman couldn't be reached for comment. 
It's ironic, in a way. For a long time, it was hard to properly value Enron because its structure and finances were so complex and hard to decipher. Now it's hard to properly value Enron because the company's attempts to clarify its finances have made it clear that it's hard to expect investors to trust in their accuracy.

Oil, gas industry on high alert after FBI warning 
Associated Press 
WASHINGTON -- The oil and gas industry is on especially high alert after a Federal Bureau of Investigation warning that Osama bin Laden may have ordered retaliatory strikes against North American natural gas facilities in event of his capture or death, industry sources said today. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the warning issued by the FBI last week was general and singled out no specific target, but referred specifically to natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines. 
There are thousands of miles of gas pipeline, most of them buried, crossing the United States and Canada. Thirty interstate gas pipelines carry 90 percent of the natural gas transported, according to the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. 
One source characterized the warning as similar to one issued earlier this month on potential attacks against West Coast bridges that prompted security alerts, but no evidence of actual terrorist intentions. 
The FBI alert prompted the American Petroleum Institute, which is the lead industry group coordinating with the FBI and Energy Department on security matters, to issue a warning to oil and gas companies. 
""We have received uncorroborated information that Osama bin Laden may have approved plans to attack natural gas supplies in the United States,"" said the memo, adding that the information was ""from a source of undetermined reliability."" 
The FBI warning continued that ""such an attack would allegedly take place in the event that either bin Laden or Taliban leader Mullah Omar are either captured or killed."" 
Energy companies have stepped up security at refineries, pipeline pumping stations and other facilities since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington and the U.S. retaliatory attacks in Afghanistan. 
Also, some detailed information about location of pipelines and other energy infrastructure have been taken off some corporate and government Internet sites. Access to facilities has been tightened as well, officials said.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"TMS and PLE now on ERequest","Getting setup for TMS Model Office and Production and PLE Production can now be done through ERequest.  You might want to look at it to know what your ""customer"" will see.  Login to ERequest and select the ""Update Account Access"" button.  Then select ""Applications"".  Be sure the Region is set to ""ETS"".  You can find the TMS and PLE options after you hit the ""Show All"" button.

Here is how the ERequest is setup to work:
1.  The user makes the request
2.  An email is sent to their manager for approval.  The manager then approves or denies the request.
3.  If the manager approves the request, an email is sent to the security approvers.  The security approvers are:
	for TMS - Maggie (primary), Ramona (secondary)
	for PLE - LInda (primary), Karen (secondary)
Once you click on the link in the email, you will be able to see what company and level of access this person is requesting.  You can also either approve or deny the request.  If you are adding comments (the solution center asks that you please do), be sure the hit the ""Add Comments"" button.
Please note:  once you click on the request link in the email it is assigned to you.  Please do not click on the link in the email unless you are going to follow through with the entire request.
4.  If the security approver approves the request, an email will be sent to the network team to give the user access.  The security approver above is expected to setup the access within the application.
5.  Once the request is finished, an email will be sent to the user.  If approved, the user will see the application on their start menu the next time he/she reboots.

There may be a few kinks in this process at first, but rest assured it is very easy to make changes.

This new process will be mentioned in tomorrow's ETS Solution Center Change Control items email.  Feel free to contact Lupita Cantu, Glenda Wagner, or Patti Dennis with questions.

"RE: TW/ENA compressor deal","for what its worth
1. probably need to be very very careful about shifting among or between contracts
2. ecs is not bankrupt..ena is, but may now have dip financing

Subject:	RE: TW/ENA compressor deal

Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Teb Lokey called to discuss the accounting of the gas given to ENA for the Ele compressors.  

ENA can not transport the gas TW gives them.  

There are a lot of unknowns at this time, I am requesting James Centilli keep us informed of what the new deal will look like.

Country music superstar Faith Hill is devastated by a secret tragedy - her newborn daughter is fighting for life.

The suit seeks $10 million in damages, and claims that Green has been keeping artists from performing on both shows for years. Clark also claims that there is a ""long list"" of stars who are prohibited from appearing on the American Music Awards, produced by Dick Clark Productions Inc., one of which is self-proclaimed King of Pop Michael Jackson.   In the lawsuit, Clark claims that Greene is the reason that Jackson will not appear on the AMAs, where he was supposed to receive the ""artist of the century"" award.   According to reports, an Academy spokesperson could not confirm nor deny that Jackson will appear on the Grammys, saying, ""Until we announce our nominees, we don't announce or confirm who's going to be on the show.""

"Outage Updates","

Mullinville Turbine - The turbine is available at this time, but they would like about 3 hours notice. They would like to do the turbine exchange next week if the system loads allow. This is the unit that was repaired in California. The one installed right now is a rental, and has to be returned by the first of the year.

Cunningham - They are doing their re-wiring of the PLC today and tomorrow. They can still inject or withdraw at this time. Thursday or Friday they would like to test the wiring job by actuating some valves. The station would have to been down 8 hours or so to do that. I told Rusty it will depend on the system requirements at that time.

Plainview Turbine - They started Monday installing the new starter and controls. They should have the work complete by Friday 11/30 if all goes well.

P3 Gray Co. - The tie-in for the new Gray Co. I/C is still scheduled for 11/29, and 11/30. P3 will be down during this outage. They will still be able to by-pass gas by the station.

If you have any questions give me a call.

	How difficult would it be to add the volume to the summary report we do today?

	Sheila and I met with Shelley and reviewed our process.  She felt very good about the process
	but would like to see the volumes impacted by the adjustments not just dollars.

	We can discuss when I get back next week.  

	Thanks. Lynn

resurgence in today's complicated energy picture. This basic overview of

products. Learn about the chemistry associated with the major operating
units, like distillation units, hydrocracker, fluid catalytic cracking

Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

"Hobbs System Conversation -- Gas Control Meeting, 11/20","Joe was visiting with Crystal Hand and Sam Rhodes, Oxy Permian, the operator for Altura Gaines (POI #78023), this morning.  

They again expressed interest in increasing their capability to flow more volume at the above by increasing the orifice plate at the meter station.  They also have included estimated costs in their upcoming budget to increase the capacity at the processing plant to accommodate increased production anticipated in the first to second quarter of 2002.  If this plate change occurred, Altura could theoretically flow up to 30,000 dths/d into NNG.  They are projecting 40,000 dths/d.  

They are also talking with Mustang at the 26""Plains i/c since they could deliver volume back to Mustang which could then flow to NNG or EPNG -- this might relieve the volume in the Hobbs System where other producers could increase their volumes.  However, Mustang doesn't want to pay the transport.  We understand Aquila owns Mustang.

Sherry has visited with Matt Chance, Dynegy, along with Debra Tower, scheduler who monitors the volumes at Warren Eunice (POI #6751).  Matt has expressed concern regarding the frequent allocation of the Hobbs System -- severely affects Dynegy's equity volumes.

Joe and I are passing along this information for your consideration in addition to the GPM Linam Ranch point.

Joe and Sherry

	Lisa,

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?

Hi everyone,
Attached is the list of all packets ending October 2001.  There are several shippers that are getting cut for today's gas day, which makes their cumulative balance be off the target volume month to date.  The following are the shippers who are off target as of the 18th of October:

Duke
ENA
MidAmerica
NSP Power Pack  (the Power Pack ends in October and should have a zero balance at month end, any residual balance will be transferred to Park and Ride)

Virginia Power

Thank you for working with your shippers in getting their packets to balance.

"RE: Could you please....","Greg,

I have been told that for system load purposes, NNG's procedure is to limit the number to two.  Obviously, someone overrode the procedure when they set up three email addresses.  They still recommend that this be limited to two.  If it is not too much trouble, they would prefer to have an email address that provides for multiple distribution internally to VEPCO.  Let me know if this is a problem.


Thanks & sorry for the confusion.

I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email
list.  I will start working on the internal email list, but can you confirm we
can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the

Greg,

This notice can only be sent to two email addresses.  I think we should
try the internal routing address like you suggested.  Let us know what
that address is and we'll get you set up.

Thanks!
Vernon

"FW: Plainview Allocations","Hasan &/or Gerry
I think there are some misunderstanding on what activity is included in a Plainview allocation. What needs to be done, as a 1st step, to initiate revisions to the Plainview allocation?

1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

Natural Gas Futures Dip as Cash Tumbles



    Natural gas futures for December delivery on the NYMEX dipped
only $0.039 to $2.813 last Wednesday with traders concerned about a
near-term rallying trend and possible colder weather soon. The
January contract settled at 2.991 per MMBtu, down $0.05. January fell
5.0 cents to settle at $2.991/MMBtu. Last Wednesday, the AGA reported
a higher than expected 15 Bcf storage injection, even so defensive
short covering was seen after the report, primarily from locals and
trades. There is now 3.132 Tcf in storage, more than the previous
high of 3.127 Tcf in  November 1998. In December of that year,
physical prices fell below $1 per MMBtu. The AGA revised the previous
week's injection from of 7 Bcf to 17 Bcf, accounting for the
additional 10 Bcf on the total. Physical prices plunged as marketers
discounted the long, low-demand holiday weekend. Expect more selling
today if sustained cold forecasts do not appear. The long holiday had
almost no industrial demand, so unless the cold is sustained, there
is little hope for higher prices. The huge gap between November cash
prices and December futures prices is a good indication that the
futures market is ripe for a huge sell-off as early as today, as it
follows cashs lead down. Natural gas for next day delivery across the
US and Canada tumbled $0.15  $0.30 per MMBtu. Natural gas for next
day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.13 to $1.93 per MMBtu.

California DWR Power Contracts May Lose Billions

    A California Department of Water Resources analysis says that
power it purchased at an average of $75 per MWh may have to be
unloaded for as little as $16 per MWh, possibly costing consumers as
much as $3.9 billion for unused power over the next 9 years. The
analysis compares DWR commitments under current power contracts to
estimates of power demand and market costs through 2010. According to
the analysis, the DWR, which buys power for the state's 3 investor-
owned utilities, may have to sell as much as 33% of the power bought
in some years at about an 80% loss. The DWR has signed about $43
billion in multiyear electricity contracts so far this year.

Enron's Japan Subsidiary Under Review

    The Japanese subsidiary of Enron is reviewing its business and
hopes to conclude its findings in the next couple of weeks. Enron
Japan is a wholly owned subsidiary. It began its own assessment about
a week ago. Enron Japan's business includes E Power Corp, a venture
set up in Japan by Enron and Orix Corp, a leasing company, which is
studying possible electric power plants. Shares of Enron plummeted
another 28% Wednesday even though it reached a critical agreement to 
extend a $690 million debt payment. Some continue to question whether
Dynegy's planned $8.9 billion acquisition will survive. The latest
problems started last week after Enron filed a document with the SEC
saying it would have to repay $690 million in debt by November 26th
because of decreased credit ratings. Enron Japan was established in
April 2000 and employs 60. It had hoped to eventually break into
Japan's power industry which is slowly growing more open.

Economic Experts to Report on Recession Today

    A panel from the National Bureau of Economic Research held a
teleconference last week to discuss whether or not the US has entered
its first recession in over 10 years and will announce the decision
on its website today. The group technically defines a recession as a
significant decline in activity spread across the economy lasting
more than a few months, visible in industrial production, employment,
real income and wholesale-retail trade. The elimination of 415,000
jobs in October, the highest in 5 years at 5.4% versus a 30-year low
of 3.9% a year ago, could lead the committee to announce a recession.
Industrial output peaked in September of last year, while
manufacturing and sales reached their top almost a year ago.
Industrial production fell at a faster rate in October than in almost
11 years, continuing a 13-month drop, according to the Federal
Reserve. Factory, wholesale and retail sales, adjusted for inflation,
topped out in August 2000 and fell for 8 out of the next 10 months.
In a signal that the slump may have bottomed-out, sales have risen
for the past 4 months. Additionally, incomes adjusted for inflation
have climbed in 9 out of the past 10 months contrary to the last
recession in which they fell for 6 out of 8 months. The implied yield
on the February federal funds futures, key indicators of the Feds
actions at its next 2 meetings is 1.91%, just 0.09% below the current
overnight rate and seems to indicate that investors do not think that
further rate reductions are in the offing. In addition, major stock
indexes have been higher for 7 of the past 9 weeks, with the Dow
Jones rising about 4% since September 11th. The Nasdaq has climbed
12% from September 10th levels and 10-year Treasury notes have risen
to 5% from a 3-year low of 4.18% on November 7th. The Blue Chip
Economic Indicator predicts that the economy will shrink by 1.9% in
the 4th-quarter and others forecast that a mild recession will
continue until the first quarter of 2002. The panel typically
requires at least 6 months of data beyond a peak in the economy
before it will consider pronouncing a recession.

California ISO Produces Plan to Meet FERC Order

    In a plan filed with the FERC last week, California's ISO has
come up with a schedule for the states Department of Water Resources
to pay off about $956 million in late payments to generators by
February 2002. The ISO oversees a daily power auction and acts as the
billing agent for sales. The operators have contended that the DWRs
status as credit guarantor for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern
California Edison relieved it of responsibility for making direct
payments. However earlier this month, the FERC declared the DWR as
scheduling coordinator, a typical designation for utilities, making
the water department liable for purchases it made on behalf of the
utilities, and gave the operators 15 days to submit a payment plan
for the period of January 17, 2001 to July 31, 2001. The utilities
still owe generators about $3.6 billion for power purchased over that
time and the DWR is owed about $2.7 billion for power supplied over
the same period, resulting in arrears of about $956 million. The
water department says it has reserved about $1.2 billion in
preparation for such a payment. The ISO says that the FERC-ordered
dual-billing system would be too complex and costly and asked that
the commission allow it to use the current system, under which all
payments would be disbursed by February 7th, 2 weeks ahead of the
FERCs schedule.

Enron Shares Fall on Takeover Concern

    Enron shares and bonds fell for a 3rd day on concern its weakened
financial condition may lead Dynegy to try to cancel or rework the
takeover. Shares dropped $0.30, or 6%, to $4.71. They fell 45%
Tuesday and Wednesday after Enron said it may have to pay more than
$9 billion in debt due by 2003. Enron 6.4% bonds due in July 2006
were bid at $0.55 on the dollar, down from $0.62 on Wednesday.
Although there are continuing doubts about the deal, others say the
deal is solid and will be completed as soon as details are worked
out. Last Wednesday, Enron got a 3-week reprieve from lenders on a
$690 million note due this week, giving the company more time to
restructure its finances. Also Dynegy's CEO says he was encouraged by
the commitment to extend the note payment, as well as the closing of
a $450 million credit facility, and that Dynegy remains committed to
the purchase. Enron's bankers have met with unidentified investors,
including leveraged buyout firms and two industrial companies, in a
bid to help its finances with an injection of as much as $2 billion.
Under the November 9th terms, Enron investors would receive 0.2685
Dynegy shares for each share held, currently making each share worth
$10.85.

New Investment Likely in Enron

Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group
are among the possible private equity investors in Enron to help the
company's balance sheet. Those firms have cash on hand and have
invested in energy companies in the past. Many of the larger, more
traditional buyout firms would find this deal attractive, analysts
say. Enron's bankers met recently with leveraged buyout firms and two
industrial companies to seek an investment. Investors may inject as
much as $2 billion under arrangements that would protect them from
further declines in the stock price. The new investments would be in
Enron's Transwestern Pipeline. JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup have
also agreed to terms that give each of them a $250 million equity
stake as part of a transaction to be completed today. KKR is the 2nd
biggest private equity firm with $24 billion in assets.

"Line Walking -- Osage Co. OK.","Hello:  We still need walkers to meet our deadline on line walking before the end of the year.  If you have people who can make themselve available please contact me or Gragg Pape so we can coordinate your efforts.  Some items that will help if you have them available are: GPS units, high wattage walkie talkies, ATV and personal gear suitable for rough country -- blaze orange vests are a plus even though deer season ends this Sunday.

I have comittments from Tony Gomez and Ken Gordon -- you're both starting on the 26?  Hotel arrangements are best in Stillwater -- major chains available there.

What is involved in the walking process?   Walkers will record any possible problem on the pipeline recording it on a pad and collecting a GPS reading at the site, these could include weeping collars, dents in exposed pipeline, missing line markers and any other anomaly which could affect the performance or integrity of the pipeline or could result in future problems such as encroachments.

This is a very important initiative as referenced in Randy's email date 11/6/01.

Delynn is checking on a tracking number and if time can be charged to EOTT, I have no knowledge of the status.


Thanks in adavance!

Several of your cost centers have non-payroll costs trailing payroll to work orders.  In order to maintain the integrity of the true capital costs, time coded outside your home cost center must be recorded to a FAR order or specific project, not a cost center.  Please remind your timekeepers or anyone responible for coding timesheets.

Thank you,

"CERA Report:  Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply","Attached is the CERA report entitled ""Drilling Activity Downturn Means Tighter Gas Supply"".

 
A short synopsis:

FALLING GAS PRICES TRIGGER ACTIVE RIG COUNT DECLINE

The economic downturn, lower industrial demand, moderate weather, and falling 
gas prices have combined to hit gas-directed drilling activity hard. Gas prices 
briefly fell below $2.00 per MMBtu in October. From a midsummer peak of 1,068 
gas-directed rigs, the US industry active rig count plummeted to 834 by 
November 9 and could fall as low as 700-750. Producers' drilling plans for the 
2002 budget year are already being curtailed.
 
*  The drilling downturn could mean as many as 8,000 fewer gas wells in the 
United States over the next 12 months and 1.5 to 2.0 billion cubic feet per day 
of lost production.

*  The majority of the activity reduction is onshore, but the significant drop 
in Gulf of Mexico shallow shelf drilling will have a huge impact on productive 
capacity.
 
*  Gas supply could be extremely tight once again next year just as the economy 
recovers, and gas demand is expected to rebound with it.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Subject:	A draft Business Continuity Plan for a Short or No Notice Evacuation of the Enron Building


Bob, Jean, Scott, and I drafted this up. They are intended to be the front and back for 3 laminated cards. They provide
the plan for responding to a very short notice or no notice evacuation of the Enron Building. The first card is for what 
I have called (we can rename the group) the BCP 1st Responders. This would include the BCP Directors and Coordinators, 
ETS Business and IT Team Leads, Mgrs, Dirs, VPs, and key staff, and ENW Contacts. The second card is for the OCC. 
The third card is for the remainder of the ETS BCP Team members, both Business and IT staff. 

Jean is touching up the OCC ETS BCP defined call burst groups and messages to match this process. Bob and I will
be completing the Hangar Offsite layout, setup process, teams, and other documentation on Monday. We will get the
documentation mounted and stored at the Hangar for use during an activation. We will also get the equipment stored 
at the Hangar. 

There is a meeting planned for Tuesday, at which we should be able to finalize the initial process, and schedule the
first test. 

Get us your comments on the attachments. We tried to keep it short and simple, but with enough detail to avoid 
confusion during such an event. 

Thanks, Gary

Mr. John Shages, Director of Economic Planning, Policy, and Finance for the
United State's Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) will address the World
Energy Security and Commerce forum on January 24, 2002. (http://www.wesc.org )

Filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve up to capacity will strengthen the long-term energy
security of the United States. Since its inception, the circumstances that might require the use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have been defined in the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. Yet each time economic or political circumstances bring the SPR into focus, questions, concerns, and misunderstandings ARE abound.  Mr. Shages will address firsthand the reasons behind the formation of the SPR, the circumstances under which it may be used, and the economics behind its administration. Topics such as inventory levels, drawdown capabilities,
exchanges and sales will be discussed in relation to today's domestic
security needs and concerns.""

Martha, 
As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.

They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?

Thanks, 
Courtney Barker

 I had this information this morning but no one asked for it. 
I told Jo someone had been coming to the meetings with that information available and it had been given out when asked for but she failed to remember that. I guess we should just announce who got cut when we talk about the allocations and if it gets to be too much information Marketing will let us know.

"Pregnant Liz Dumps Beau -- & Rushes Back To Hugh","
[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]	


[IMAGE]	


     [IMAGE]PREGNANT LIZ DUMPS BEAU -- & RUSHES BACK TO HUGH  [IMAGE]WILL WEDDING BELLS BE NEXT?     [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] A radiant Liz, seen here in London, puts the tears of her breakup with boyfriend Steve Bing behind her   Pregnant Liz Hurley broke down in tears and dumped boyfriend Steve Bing after he told her he didn't want to become a dad.   Then she flew back to Britain to be comforted by former lover Hugh Grant - who's now trying to woo her back!  That's the tangled tale behind the headlines as Liz's roller-coaster relationship with Grant takes another incredible turn.   Now close pals are predicting the glamour couple will tie the knot - and Hugh will adopt Liz's baby!   ""Hugh's already acting like it's his child,"" revealed a source close to the couple.   ""Bing didn't want the baby - so why not?""   Said an insider: ""Hugh never wanted to lose Liz - she was the one who dumped him after he was caught with a hooker in Hollywood.    ""But he's always been there for her - now more than ever.  [IMAGE] A pensive Hugh leaves Liz's London home, where he and Liz are staying together.  ""He was the one who went with her and held her hand when she had her first ultrasound. They're both living under the same roof at Liz's house in London while Hugh's apartment is remodeled.   ""He's doing all he can to win her back - and it wouldn't surprise any of their pals if they get married and Hugh adopts the baby!   ""When Liz discovered she was expecting Bing's baby, she never considered an abortion. She always wanted a baby and she realizes that at age 36 her biological clock is ticking.   ""And when she looks at other famous moms like Madonna, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Kate Winslet, she realizes she can have a career AND a baby.""   Bing, $600 million real estate heir and wanna-be Hollywood producer, wooed Liz over private dinners at the $3,000-a-night suite he keeps at the posh Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles.   But close pals say Bing's negative reaction to Liz's pregnancy stunned the supermodel and killed their romance for good.   Now she's dubbed the 37-year-old playboy ""Bing Laden""!  [IMAGE]         [IMAGE]       [IMAGE]ROBERT DOWNEY JR. FOCUSING ON FAMILY FIRST   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] ROBERT DOWNEY JR.  In an evaluation hearing in California, Robert Downey Jr. told the judge that his focus right now in life is his recovery and his family.   ""Furthering my endeavor in recovery ? is really my priority for right now,"" Downey told Riverside County Superior Court Judge Randall D. White. ""I've been able to re-establish contact with my family. That's the only privilege I consider myself really to have at this point.""   Downey was sentenced to one year at a live-in rehab facility and three years of probation last year after pleading no contest to a charge of cocaine possession and being under the influence.    ""With some humility I'd like to let the court know I appreciate your allowing me to continue,"" Downey told Judge White.   Although Downey did not speak to reporters, his attorney James Epstein revealed that Downey has turned down many offers for acting jobs since he has been in treatment. ""You'll have Robert again, I promise, on the screen. But for now, he's focusing on his personal life,"" said Epstein.   Downey is scheduled for another evaluation hearing in March of 2002.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Meeting Thursday to discuss ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave Neubauer
Importance:	High

	
	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

"RE: TMS SQL2K migration","Hasan,
I could not open this file. Gerry printed it for me. I was not sure I followed the test plan. Is it testing from Oct. 19th to Nov. 2nd?
Since we will have a new model office refresh to deal with on the Oct. 31st, we would like to push to be complete with testing by Wednesday. Oct. 31st, and plan for Thursday night migration which is Nov. 1st.

I will have Kathy Washington, Maggie Matheson, and myself testing for the next two weeks beginning Monday Oct. 22 nd testing through Nov. 1st. Will that work for your team? Please let me know.

Thanks Ramona

Attached is the project plan for TMS migration to SQL2K.

Couple of key items to note.  In order to create an implementation date, I took the liberty of allocating 2 weeks for user testing.  This could change based on customer input.  Additionally, Model Office refresh is very critical.  I have tentatively scheduled it for 10/17 and 10/18.  Any changes to either the Model office refresh dates or the testing schedule will impacting the implementation date.

thanks

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

Natural Gas Futures Rally on Short-Covering


    Natural gas for February delivery on the NYMEX jumped $0.155
higher Friday to $2.774 per MMBtu as winter's chill and forecasts for
continued cold throughout January for eastern states and the Midwest
had locals scurrying to cover their short positions. The March
contract gained $0.123 to $2.746 per MMBtu. A flurry of buying
started early in the session, a reaction in part to Thursday's
liquidation on the January contract expiration. Clearing the books of
Enron-related hedging losers in time for year-end could also be
playing a role in Friday's rally. Some of the volatility over the
past month has been triggered by larger books balancing their hedges.
Enron's demise has forced counter-parties to recontract supplies,
pushing the market with offers or with bids. Shuffling monthly
spreads from fall to winter and balancing volumes bought at higher
prices during the summer for storage will also trickle to a stop mid-
January as some storage operators call for contracted withdrawals.
The AGA will again delay its release of last week's storage data
until Thursday because of the holidays. For the first time this
winter, many traders are anticipating a triple digit withdrawal this
week. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was
generally flat to $0.10 higher Friday. Natural gas for next day
delivery at the Henry hub gained $0.01 to $2.64 per MMBtu.

Shareholder Activism Driven by Enron Problems

    Pension funds, stockholders groups and outspoken investors have
began flooding the firms they own with proposals for change driven
this year by the collapse of Enron. Shareholders are using this
year's filings to try to make sure other companies don't go the same
way as Enron. What is new this year is the auditor independence
proposals. Pension funds affiliated with the United Brotherhood of
Carpenters union have filed 12 proposals calling on companies not to
hire the same accounting firm to do both audit and non-audit work.
Enron, paid Andersen $52 million in 2000 for both audit and non-audit
services, a dual relationship that has raised questions about
Andersen's judgment. The proposals are part of an annual flood that
hits companies around the end of year. Their goal is to be included
in the company's proxy statement, which is mailed to all
shareholders, as an item to be brought to the floor of the company's
annual meeting for a vote. If companies want to exclude qualified
proposals from their proxies, they need approval from the SEC. In
2001 the SEC handled 438 requests from companies for permission to
exclude shareholder proposals from their proxies.

TXU Proposes Settlement for Overcharges

    TXU Electric has filed a plan with the Texas PUC to settle
charges that it erroneously collected stranded payment costs before
the state opens its power market next week. The costs are aimed at
offsetting expenses for building generating plants and related
regulatory financing plans prior to deregulation. As natural gas
prices soared a year ago, the PUC alleged that TXU and other Texas
utilities had no stranded costs related to generating assets because
of the large amount of natural gas fired generation in the state.
Climbing prices made natural gas fired plants almost as costly to
operate as nuclear plants. If the settlement is approved by the PUC,
TXU will return $350 million to retail electric suppliers over 2
years by providing credits on transmission and distribution rates.
TXU said it may take a charge of less than $50 million in the 4th
quarter because of the settlement. TXU also said it would eliminate
any remaining stranded costs related to its Comanche Peak nuclear
station. TXU also proposes that the PUC authorize it to issue $500
million in bonds in early 2002 and $800 million after 2003 related to
the utility's regulatory assets or previous financing agreements
approved by the PUC. The settlement also cuts a possible penalty to
$90 per customer from $150 in the event TXUs retail affiliate retains
more than 60% of its customers after the first 2 years of
competition.

Exelon Power Team to Double its Wind Capacity

    Exelon Power Team will purchase the output of a 65 MW wind
facility in Tucker County, WV for 20 years from Backbone Mountain
Windpower. The project will include about 42 wind turbines, each
producing about 1.5 MW. The 65 MW facility will utilize the latest
wind turbine technology and will be the largest commercial wind
energy facility in the eastern US. The project is expected to be
operational by December 2002. It will interconnect with the Allegheny
Power System in the PJM West RTO and will be integrated with the PJM
RTO. Earlier this year, Power Team signed 20-year purchase agreements
for 9 MW from the Somerset Wind Power Project, 15 MW from the Mill
Run Wind Project and 52 MW from the Moosic Mountain Wind Farm near
Scranton. This agreement brings Power Team's wind portfolio to 144
MW. The Backbone Mountain Wind Project will add to the amount of
clean energy available to customers in the PJM territory. Community
Energy and Power Team are jointly marketing the output of wind
projects. Large commercial customers, such as the University of
Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University,
Philadelphia Suburban Water Company and Giant Eagle Foods, have
already purchased wind energy from Power Team and Community Energy
for periods from 15 years. Power Team's current renewable supply
portfolio includes wind, landfill gas, hydroelectric, and biomass
generation.

   The FERC December 19th decision that the Midwest ISO be the
vehicle for a single, regional transmission organization in the
Midwest is an important decision.  It will spark the development of a
competitive regional power market in the Midwest, of particular
importance to energy-intensive Midwestern states, according to a
customer coalition active in the federal arena. The Coalition of
Midwest Transmission Customers and the Industrial Energy Users-Ohio,
stated that FERC's decision paves the way for actual implementation
of plans to get a truly independent entity for the Midwest
transmission grid, that encompasses twenty states and Manitoba,
Canada, up and running. The coordination so critical to system
reliability and Ohio's business and industry can now proceed on a
timeline that should allow the Midwest to avoid a repetition of
problems we saw a couple of summers ago.  Because the Midwest economy
is so energy-intensive, the Coalition hopes to see the ISO continue
with development at a challenging pace since an effective regional
marketplace will benefit not only residential users but also
Midwestern businesses in their efforts to thrive in the worldwide
marketplace. The FERC Order also found that creation of the Alliance
RTO does not satisfy scope and configuration requirements spelled out
in FERC's Order 2000. The Commission made plain that the Alliance
companies could continue with the formation of the for-profit
Transco, but under the Midwest ISO umbrella. The significance of
this, is that the FERC is focusing on the importance of a single
organization as opposed to its form. From the perspective of market
participants, both buyers and sellers, this and other recent FERC
decisions are strong indications that a highly coordinated and
competitive marketplace is the goal for the industry. FERC's November
20th orders preventing several utilities from using their market-
pricing authority in areas where they have market power is as
critical to nurturing an effective market as the order for a single
Midwest RTO.

K2 Innovative Drilling Technology

   K2 Energy in conjunction with Midnight Sun Drilling from
Whitehorse, Yukon, has made a major break-through in shallow natural
gas drilling. By utilizing a hard rock mining rig and adapting its
reverse circulation center sampling technology to shallow low-
pressure gas drilling, the resulting formation damage is virtually
eliminated. The air circulates down between the inner and outer drill
pipe, drives the air hammer, and reverse circulates the rock cuttings
back up to surface. This virtually eliminates drilling damage to the
formation.

No, I do not want the ENA contract hit with these flows.  We effectively shut them down on the 3rd.  Between then and 12/20, I want to look at other options.  I left Steve Kirk a message and he replied that he is out through Jan 2.  He suggested talking with Dari today regarding other options.  I'll let you know once I do.

Thanks!

	Vernon, the way the accounting system works today:  Dec. 1 - 20 flow will be attributed  to the
	contract that nominated at that point for the 21 through 31.  This automaticall happens if there
	is no OBA at the point and if there is only one contract nominated at the point.  If we do not want
	that to happen, we need to discuss our options. Thanks. Lynn

Yes, we were successful in getting a transporter to step in.  This starts tomorrow - however I am in talks with regulatory on what to do on the days between 12/3 - 12/20.  Also, we are not going to grant an OBA at this point at this time.

Vernon, Embassy is getting lined out for January business.  They just got caught in the middle of the ENA fallout, but they are anxious to get a resolution for December in place.  Thanks for your help.

The volumes were scheduled for the 1st and 2nd only, then the nomination was removed and scheduled to 0. The point continues to flow without a nom or scheduled volume.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Thanks,
Jean

Thanks for the contact. I have passed this on to Vernon Mercaldo to see what interest they might have in holding their own upstream transportation.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

Subject:	RE: Reverse Auction Posting

	I spoke with Steve Kirk regarding this issue.  On May 3, 2001, the Reverse Auction shippers were notified that the Reverse Auction Pool POI  would be terminated November 1 and a revised Appendix A for the contracts setting forth the specific allocations of entitlement at Ventura, Welcome and Aberdeen points were provided to the shippers.  Therefore, the notice on the website would only need to remind shippers that the Reverse Auction Pool will terminate effective November 1, 2001.  We would recommend that the following notice be posted at anytime. 

	Reminder: The Reverse Auction Pool POI 60460 will be terminated November 1, 2001.

	Please let me know if there are any questions or concerns.  Thanks MW

"Packets ending October, 2001","Attached is a list of all packets ending October 2001.  Most need adjustments because of rounding, however, there are some that need additional adjustments before month end.   Any balance left at the end of the month will be transferred to their Park & Ride contract.  

These are the shippers that need special attention:

Aquila	#108027 and #108028
ENA	#106875 and #107822

Entering the new millennium, energy companies are being forced to do business in new ways. Tough environmental legislation, product price sensitivity, mergers and acquisitions, downsizing, supply shortages, and profitability pressures all pose significant challenges to the energy industry as a whole. However, nothing poses more of a challenge than the Internet revolution.

"Thanksgiving Holiday","
As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.  
With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom. We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together. 
I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for your continued dedication.
Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.   
Happy Thanksgiving.
Stan

December Crude Oil Futures Fall on Expiration


    Crude oil futures for December delivery on the NYMEX lost $0.31
to $17.72 per barrel as the contract expired yesterday. January crude
oil futures on the NYMEX gained $0.06 to $18.43 per barrel. December
crude futures sank to $16.70 per barrel soon after the opening bell,
but recovered some of losses before the sessions end. The market
appears to be monitoring the fray between Russia and OPEC over
production cuts. OPEC has delayed a planned 1.5 million bpd cut until
Russia agrees to significant output curbs. So far, Mexico has agreed
to a 100,000 bpd cut and Norway said it would discuss production
limits this week. Russia's privately held oil companies, however do
not seem inclined to make any major changes in production and say
that they can live with lower oil prices and still make a profit,
further increasing speculation of a price war. December gasoline
futures on the NYMEX gained 0.0057 to 0.5079 per gallon. Heating oil
futures for December delivery on the NYMEX rose $0.002 to $0.5328 per
gallon. In London, Brent crude oil futures for January delivery on
the IPE were up $0.26 to $18.01 per barrel.

ChevronTexaco to Cut Additional Jobs

    ChevronTexaco now says it will cut 4500 jobs, 500 additional cuts
from its previous estimate. ChevronTexaco expects to achieve $1.8
million in yearly savings by 2003 by eliminating jobs that became
redundant when the two companies merged earlier this year. The
company also affirmed its $1.2 billion synergy savings within 6 - 9
months of the merger's completion. The cost cuts will be made across
the board, with the largest percentage expected in the refining and
marketing sector. ChevronTexaco projects that its return on capital
employed will increase from 2% to 3% within the next 2 years. It also
expects its oil and natural gas production to grow 2.5% - 3% annually
over the next 5 years, although output will rise only 1% next year
because of matters related to OPEC. The company says that its
investment in Dynegy, which recently has agreed to buy Enron, offers
a combination of significant upside potential and terms that will
protect its investment.

Mergers Spark Lack of Competition Concerns


    The latest merger in the oil industry, the $35 billion Phillips
and Conoco deal, has sparked worries that the lack of competition
could lead to volatile prices. As smaller companies leave the market,
the handful that remain will be dealing in progressively larger
volumes, which could result in increased price volatility. So far,
the FTC has presented very little in the way of a roadblock to the
mergers and takeovers. However, critics fear that if the fast-paced
trend in combining companies continues, the nation could perhaps end
up with only 3 super-giant oil companies, promoting a lack of
competition and causing consumers to pay much higher prices. But if
crude oil and natural gas prices collapse, only the biggest companies
will survive. The big mergers not only cut corporate costs, but also
increases a company's ability to deal in the Middle East. Some
analysts see the merger mania as an ongoing cyclical process and say
that at some point in the future there could be a rash of spin-offs
in the industry. Conoco-Phillips will become the 6th largest oil
company in the world and the 3rd largest in the US, behind Exxon
Mobil and ChevronTexaco. The Conoco-Phillips merger is seen by many
as a partnership of equals, made to survive in an industry of giants,
as the combined company will only be a quarter of the size of Exxon
Mobil.

Shareholders Approve Phillips Conoco Merger


    The merger between Phillips and Conoco has received approval from
shareholders. The deal will make the new company, called
ConocoPhillips, the world's 6th largest publicly held oil company
with a market value of $35 billion, although it will still be only a
quarter of ExxonMobil's size. In what seems to many to be a
partnership of equals, Phillips has agreed to pay $15.2 billion in a
stock exchange at the rate of 0.4677 per share of Phillips for each
share of Conoco and assume $9 billion in debt. Shares of Phillips
gained $1.53, almost 3%, to $53.35 and Conoco's shares climbed $1.68,
almost 7%, to $25.98 per share yesterday. Some of Conoco's investors
were disappointed by the sale price because no premium on their stock
was included. However, they were pleased to hear projections of $750 
million yearly in cost savings and 4% annual growth in oil and
natural gas production as a result of deal.

Heating Oil Prices May Decline More

    Even though heating oil futures rose $0.0109 last Friday to
finish at $0.05218 per gallon on the NYMEX, prices are still hovering
near their lowest point since August 1999. Existing stocks and an
impending OPEC price war are contributing to the decline in price for
heating oil and diesel. The nation's heating oil supply is now at
129.8 million barrels, a two-year high and 31% higher than a year
ago.

Russia Continues to Resist OPEC

    Russia continues to resist OPEC's pressure to help support
tumbling world oil prices, with both the government and companies
offering no new cuts in output or exports to support the market.
Russia's repeated rejection to reduce its supplies of crude oil again
sent prices falling yesterday. Russia reiterated its resistance to
others demands during talks with the energy minister of Mexico, which
has said it would make export reductions of its own. OPEC wants
Russia and other non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway to cut
production by 500,000 barrels in January. If they do, OPEC says it
will cut 1.5 million bpd. Russia says the world economy would grow
faster if prices stay at the $17-$19 per barrel range. It is also
technically more difficult for Russia to cut output than the Middle
East.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

Subject:	Draft Statement on High Nitrogen

DRAFT

On October 11, 2001 Northern was informed by El Paso Natural Gas that the nitrogen level in the gas being delivered into El Paso's system at the El Paso/NNG Keystone interconnect (POI # 169) exceeded El Paso's nitrogen tariff specification.  El Paso's tariff restrict the nitrogen level in the gas stream to no more than 3%.  According to El Paso, the nitrogen level on October 11 at the Keystone interconnect was 3.5%.  El Paso refused to allow deliveries from Northern into El Paso on this day.

Northern does not have a tariff specification that restricts the receipt of gas with nitrogen over a certain level.  However, Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff states that 

	""The gas shall be commercially free from objectionable odors, solid matter, dust, gums and gum-forming constituents, or any other substance which may interfere 	with the merchantability of the gas, or cause injury to or interference with proper operation of the lines, meters, regulators, or other appliances through which it 	flows.""

It is Northern's position that any gas which has a high nitrogen content that makes the gas delivered from Northern's system non-merchantable is subject to being curtailed/allocated.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in this area which would affect the total level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  If it becomes necessary for Northern to curtail receipts to ensure that the gas stream is merchantable to El Paso at the Keystone interconnect, gas receipts into Northern will be curtained/allocated according to the following order.  These points have been listed according the level of nitrogen in the gas stream.  The receipt point listed first has the highest level of nitrogen, the second point listed has the second highest level, etc.

		1.  NNG/Pinnacle Terry 			POI 60022
		2.  Gaines County #2			POI 401
		3.  Gaines County #3-NNG		POI 395
		4.  NNG/Altura Gaines			POI 78023
		5.  GPM Fullerton Plant			POI 36511
		6.  Adobe Plant				POI 25450
		7.  Spraberry Area			
		8.  NNG/Amerada Hess Gaines Co.    	POI 78028
		9.  Warren Eunice			POI 6751
          	          10.  Hobbs Area																	   	          11.  LLano/NNG Lea			POI 200

If El Paso refuses to allow deliveries from Northern into EL Paso Keystone, Northern may require all gas to be received from shippers in this portion of our system to conform to the gas quality specification set forth in Section 44 of Northern's FERC Gas Tariff.  Any previously granted waivers by Northern of Section 44 of its FERC Gas Tariff relating to receipts shall no longer be effective until further notice.

Subject:	SLA Settlement



As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

FYI,

I got a call form Larry at Bushton. He said they having trouble with a pump in the treater plant. They haven?t received the spare pump yet, so there could be a possibility that the treater plant could be down this weekend. Which means Lyons would be down. They just wanted to give us a heads up, so we can figure this in our weekend plan.

Subject: Update VPN/IPASS (remote access)


Everyone - We are currently looking into what our (ETS) options are with iPASS/VPN.  As of right now, VPN should work just like before.  Shirley Walden, Mary Lou Phillips and Beverly Miller should be able to work from home starting tomorrow.  I will test the VPN connectivity from home tonight.  I did work from home last night without any issues. 
 
I am also working with the Solution Center to send out the new instructions to everyone for remote access via phone dialing, as we only have one number available now.  
 
As of today, everyone has rights for remote access/VPN.  Please stop all e-requests for iPASS/VPN access.  I have approval from Net Works to give a spreadsheet for access instead of an e-request for each user.   
 
For future requests, Donna and I are working on a easier way to give/get approval via e-requests.   We will communicate the new process soon.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions or issues.  
 
Thanks.  Jean

Lynn, any update yet from Gary or Caroline as to the updates you requested in your December 11 email?  I am finalizing a letter to Alliant and would like to provide them with an expectation as to the October PPA's.  Specifically, will all the October charts be corrected?

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

I agree. The settlement is an agreed upon measurement number. Not an agreed upon difference.

Charlie sent me the following message.
""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

The Plant PTR values were obtained from a letter from ONEOK  to Harry Woodson dated November 1, 2001.  This information may help in determining the settlement volume for this time period.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

Subject:	RE: TransCanada --fyi, Upcoming Name Change

We have not yet received the appropriate paperwork.  November 1 is the EARLIEST we can make the name change assuming we receive the paperwork and we get the proper credit approval.  I understand there will also be a DUNS number change.  If this is true, we need to notify all our shippers a minimum of 5 days in advance.  

We'll push the name change through as quickly as possible, but we can't do it until our ducks are in a row.

As most of you know, BP purchased the gas and power marketing division of TransCanada effective October 1st.  The legal entity and name change will go into our system November 1st.  My understanding is the appropriate documentation has already been sent to our offices.

In the event, anyone telephones them, the receptionists in their Omaha offices now answer the telephone as BP Gas & Power.  The legal name actually is BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp.  To date, it appears there have been no other changes with scheduling and accounting personnel.

Should there be any questions, please let me know -- thanks.

It sounds as if, despite the concerns we had earlier in the week, it is alright to go ahead and do a full refresh of the model office environment, including TSS.  Larry's testing database is totally separate and is not set to get automatically updated.

Crude Oil Futures Slip in Profit-Taking


    Crude oil futures for February delivery on the NYMEX slipped
$0.37 to $20.90 per barrel yesterday, but remained near 6-week highs.
Traders attributed the losses to some profit-taking after crude
prices climbed by $1.65 per barrel on Wednesday. Speculation that
OPEC members will keep pumping over their quotas also pressured the
market downward. OPEC is expected to announce its 4th production cut
in a year today. It is expected to cut output by 1.5 million bpd
after receiving pledges from non-member producing countries to lower
exports by a combined total of 462,500 bpd. However, the 10 OPEC
members with quotas exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in
November. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and non-
members will be closer to 1.0  1.2 million bpd, which could be enough
to prevent crude oil inventories from rising. The production cuts are
aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPEC's
basket of crudes. The IEA has forecast that world oil demand will
rise next year by 600,000 bpd, about 30% below the demand growth rate
over the last decade. Heating oil futures for January delivery on the
NYMEX fell $0.0131 to $0.5815 per gallon. January gasoline futures on
the NYMEX dipped $0.0086 to $0.5927 per gallon. In London, Brent
crude oil futures for February delivery on the IPE were up $1.01 to
$20.34 per barrel.

Canadian Oil Stocks Surge


    Canadian oil stocks surged yesterday morning as investors
welcomed apparent confirmation that OPEC would make its much
predicted production cut today. The Toronto Stock Exchange oil and
natural gas sub-index was up 1.89% at 9,047.34 just before noon. The
jump followed Saudi Arabia's oil minister's statement that OPEC would
announce a production cut of 1.5 million bpd. The Canadian markets
were closed Tuesday and Wednesday for the Christmas holiday. The
TSE's energy group topped the 9,000 level for the first time in more
than a month. Non-OPEC exporters Russia, Mexico, Norway, Oman and
Angola have together agreed to cut crude exports by 462,500 bpd.

Fitch Places Express Pipeline on Rating Watch Negative


    Fitch has placed the `A' rating of the $150 million 6.47% senior
secured notes and the `BBB' rating of the $250 million 7.39%
subordinated secured notes issued by Express Pipeline on Rating Watch
Negative. The action reflects the weakened fundamentals of the US
energy market and the resulting impact on the overall credit quality
of the crude shippers. In addition, the financial performance of
Express has been below original projections due to weakened demand in
its targeted regional markets. The Express notes were issued in
February 1998 to finance the construction of the Express Pipeline and
to repay the costs incurred in the acquisition and upgrading of the
Platte pipeline. The ability of Express to service its debt is
largely dependent upon the revenues received from the pipeline
transportation tariffs paid by various crude shippers under
contractual off-take arrangements. Express is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Alberta Energy. The Express Pipeline System consists of
two main segments, the Express and Platte pipelines. The Express
segment is 785 miles long beginning in Hardisty, Alberta and running
to Casper, WY. The Platte segment is 932 miles long beginning in
Casper and extending to Wood River, IL.

Nigeria Under Pressure to Comply with New Quotas


   At the OPEC meeting today in Cairo, Nigeria will likely receive
intense pressure to increase compliance with its official OPEC
limits. The cartel is expected to finalize an agreement to cut 1.5
million bpd from output along with almost 500,000 bpd of reductions
from non-OPEC producers at the meeting. The cartels overall
compliance with its self-imposed limits improved in November as the
10 members were 600,000 bpd over their limits. However, according to
its own data, Nigeria pumped 300,000 bpd in excess of its quota,
making it responsible for half the cheating. If OPEC cuts output by
an expected 1.5 million bpd, Nigeria's new quota would be about 1.79
million bpd, necessitating a 400,000 bpd cut, or 22% from its
November volumes. Nigeria's presidential adviser on energy will
takeover as OPEC President on January 1st, making it even more
important that it adhere to the quota. Some cartel members say that
full compliance will be stressed at the meeting because they have
asked non-members to make commitments and it is important for OPEC to
stick to set an example. It is unlikely that OPEC members will reach
full compliance during January. Sales commitments for the month have
already been made and although some members like Saudi Arabia have
flexibility in their contracts others would need to reduce volumes
already sold.

Russia's Oil Export Plan Leaves Loopholes


    Russia's 1st quarter oil export schedule makes it only appear
that the country will keep a promise to cut 150,000 bpd of exports in
a bid to help OPEC lift sagging crude prices. This week, it set an
export schedule to export 30.9 million tonnes of its own crude and
will ship 3.63 million tonnes of Kazakh and 725,000 tonnes of Azeri
crude in the 1st quarter of next year. Although the schedule looks
like a firm pledge to reduce exports, there is no benchmark figure to
which the schedule could be compared. Russian traders say that the
country's oil firms will seek ways to increase crude exports to the
West because it pays more than domestic consumers. They point out
that while the export schedule includes only volumes moved by the
state pipeline Transneft, over 2 million tonnes per quarter bypass
Transneft. There are many ways to increase officially declared 1st
quarter volumes, for example, by allowing oil companies to export
cargoes not shipped in November and December due to storms. It is
also possible that Russian oil companies will increase oil volumes to
Ukraine and Belarus refineries, where their further shipments will be
hard to track.

OPEC Expected to Announce Production Cut Today

    OPEC is expected to officially announce its plan to cut up to 1.5
million bpd from exports at a meeting in Cairo today. The output cut
is expected to be effective as of January 1st and last 3-6 months and
is aimed at lifting prices back into the $22 - $25 range for OPECs
basket of crudes. But some members of the cartel appear to be bowing
to the realization that the global economy has weakened by saying
that they believe $20 to $22 is a reasonable level and that $25 is
not a reasonable price. The demand for oil is growing at its slowest
pace since 1984, forcing OPEC and non-aligned producers to cut
supplies. The IEA predicts that oil demand will grow by just 600,000
bpd, which is 30% lower than the average growth over the last decade.
However, many think that OPEC will fail because of the cartels poor
record of compliance to previously instituted reductions. OPEC
members exceeded their quotas by 500,000 - 600,000 bpd in November.
If OPEC does not stick to its self-imposed limits, there is very
little incentive for producers outside the cartel to abide by their
commitments. Some expect that actual output reductions from OPEC and
non-members will be closer to between 1 million and 1.2 million bpd,
which would be just about enough to keep stockpiles from rising.

Subject:	SLA Settlement



As you are aware,  NNG has reached a settlement with the shippers in the SLA proceeding.  Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.  Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.  Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.  I assume you are OK with this assignment.

We would like to get together and discuss our general approach to this effort.  Steve and I think our initial meeting could be held in the Video Conference room.    Could you let me know your availability to get together sometime next week for appr 1 -1/12 hours?

I will then try to coordinate a meeting of the group and probably include Mary Kay and possibly Dave Neubauer.

Let me know.

Thanks!

Mike McGowan

"FW: SCG Advice 2837-A","After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Charlie sent me the following message.
""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

[IMAGE] 	[IMAGE]   [IMAGE]   [IMAGE] [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]   Your inspirational quote for the day:  [IMAGE]      Lesson For Life   [IMAGE]  During my second month of nursing school,   our professor gave us a pop quiz. I   was a conscientious student and had breezed   through the questions, until I read the last one:    ""What is the first name of the woman  who cleans the school?""    Surely this was some kind of joke.   I had seen the cleaning woman several times.   She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s,   but how would I know her name?    I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank.   Just before class ended, one student   asked if the last question would   count toward our quiz grade.    ""Absolutely,"" said the professor. ""In your   careers, you will meet many people.   All are significant. They deserve your   attention and care, even if all you do is   smile and say 'hello'.""    I've never forgotten that lesson.   I've also never forgotten her name was Dorothy.

"Northern v. ONEOK/Meeting Thursday to discuss ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave Neubauer","	
	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

	Britt

We will be giving you a list Tuesday morning that will show all of the shippers that we sent invoices to on December 3.  Do not call them until we get that list to you.  We would like for you to highlight the shippers that you have called and then return the lists to us.  This will help us to ensure that everyone has been called.

Please note:  If you shipper currently knows our Lock Box number because they send checks, please be sure that you call these folks because we cannot let them use the Lock Box.  They can still send a check in, but they will need to send it to the P.O. Box 1188 for this building.  If possible, give them your room location so that it can come directly to you.  If you have any questions, please let us know.

I think there are some misunderstanding on what activity is included in a Plainview allocation. What needs to be done, as a 1st step, to initiate revisions to the Plainview allocation?

1. What points make up the Permian Area? (Permian Area has 2 Groups, 19 and 20)
2. Is Plainview in the middle of the Permian Area?
3. If Plainview is the beginning or end of the Permian Area, which way is the gas flowing, North or South?
4. We have a flow capacity of 500,000 going north and south.
5. Location of any Deferred Delivery Point and Physical Receipt Point needs to be considered whether to be allocated or not depending on the way the gas is flowing.
6. The requirements need to consider all receipts and delivery locations whether upstream or downstream of Plainview and the flow of gas.

During a Plainview allocations, the following rules should apply. 

Exclude:
Transportation when receipt is in the Permian Area and the delivery is in the Permian Area (at a point other than DDP) [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt is sourced from Permian Area Storage point and re-delivery is North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

Include:
Transportation when receipt is in Permian Area and the delivery is a point North of Plainview [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 
Transportation when receipt in Permian Area and the delivery is to Permian Area DDP [Medeles, Gerry]   No. 

								(*DDP = Deferred Delivery Point)

Gerry and/or Joe.
I believe these rules are already part of the Plainview allocation. Can you verify that for me?
[Medeles, Gerry]  The only line items/nominations that are excluded from a group allocation, is gas that is received and delivered within the group.

Do you want me to call it a transfer or a data correction?  Also, what effective date should I use?  

I think we should use Jan. 1st for all corrections if we are changing company number to be on the safe side with regard to the employees' tax deductions.  Let me know what you think.  We will probably get many co./cost center change requests for the new year.  

Thanks,

	Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name is on the list.
	Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the list
	and added the new people.  

	Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on

We have received a letter from Gary Weihrauch advising of the name and Duns change for the above.  I will bring copies down to your desks immediately.

We have not yet received the appropriate paperwork.  November 1 is the EARLIEST we can make the name change assuming we receive the paperwork and we get the proper credit approval.  I understand there will also be a DUNS number change.  If this is true, we need to notify all our shippers a minimum of 5 days in advance.  

We'll push the name change through as quickly as possible, but we can't do it until our ducks are in a row.

As most of you know, BP purchased the gas and power marketing division of TransCanada effective October 1st.  The legal entity and name change will go into our system November 1st.  My understanding is the appropriate documentation has already been sent to our offices.

In the event, anyone telephones them, the receptionists in their Omaha offices now answer the telephone as BP Gas & Power.  The legal name actually is BP Canada Energy Marketing Corp.  To date, it appears there have been no other changes with scheduling and accounting personnel.

Should there be any questions, please let me know -- thanks.

Michele,
I just found a note that I had written to myself about posting on the web site a notice to remind the Reverse Auction shippers that effective Nov. 1, they wouldn't be able to nominate to the Reverse Auction point anymore.  It may be worth it to check with Bill Fowler and/or Lynn Blair to see if they think this would be beneficial.  Do you want to follow up on this?

She has taken lots of notes and seems to understand what needs to be done.  The area she still has concerns with is: El Paso - when is it a loop and when is it going to or from TW.  So be sure to let her know if there are any.

I let her do everything Saturday evening and with the exception of a couple of questions, she soloed.  I feel she will do fine on evenings starting Wednesday, the 26th.

Subject:	All tests were NOT successfully executed


All testing was completed this morning.  Through the web access, all systems tested successfully.  However, we've had numerous calls indicating that the TMS application cannot be accessed through the Start-Programs method.  

We contacted the ENW Resolution Center at 6:20 a.m. and were told that there had been a problem with the cluster last night.  They asked us to assure that everyone had logged off last night, and we did.  People reporting problems accessing the application through the start menu are advised how to access it from the web.  We have had a problem in the past where security rights are lost to the ETSTMS folder when there have been problems with the cluster.  A critical ticket has been opened, and the ENW Information Risk Management group has been paged.  We will keep you apprised of our progress.

I think the number is really five since we have 3 people already on the email

can have more than two and likely five.  It seems like since we have 3 this is
more than 2 and the five people is likely.  Let me know and thanks for the

that address is and we'll get you set up.
