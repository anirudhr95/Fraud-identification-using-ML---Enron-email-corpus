Just wanted to let everyone know that I have ordered 50 boxes that are to be used to send any old files to the Record Center.  When you get ready to use these, please let me know because there are numbered stickers for each box that I will also need to give you along with directions on how the transmittal sheets are to be typed up.

Lynn,

In reviewing the Duke contract 27291, I did find that the rate was not correct for four months in the past year.  I also reviewed Duke contract 27349 since it also had the same type of alternate to California deal.  Two months on the second contract were not billed correctly.  If Marketing can input the correct rates into the system, I can regenerate the invoices and bill Duke immediately.  Please see the attached file for details.

Thanks,  Bert

	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Good letter.  One suggestion--our insistence that the meters and the chromatograph ""were reliably and accurately . . ."" doing their respective things sounds kind of defensive.  In fact, we don't know what they were doing because we have no record of the data they sent to the ROC, right?  Would it be less adversarial to simply say ""the ultrasonic meters . . .continued to operate normally. . ."" and to say the same for the chromatograph?  We do know that the meters and chromatograph did continue to operate because they had not shut down, right?  Also, I'd like to better understand the formula we're using to alibi the data.  What are ""the time periods of normal operation""?  Was that ratio developed from our data from Sep. 1-12?  IF so, why does the formula create such a significant increase in the variance?  Thanks. df

Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc


Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an ""an"" in the first sentence, right before the word ""incident""; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

	Ladies & Gentlemen:

	At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

	Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

	I appreciate your patience.	

	Many thanks.

I think we should use Jan. 1st for all corrections if we are changing company number to be on the safe side with regard to the employees' tax deductions.  Let me know what you think.  We will probably get many co./cost center change requests for the new year.

Is there a reason why the work on September 4th to the VPN can not be done during the normal maintenance window provided for this type of outage?
This outage is presently planned during core business hours and ETS Customer Service has Home Office Workers that gain access through VPN. This will cause them not to be able to provided our customers with any assistance.

From 11:00 - 11:30 a.m., the ETS IT team will test the SCADA Frame-Relay Backup to Maitland.  Maitland users will lose data and voice connectivity to the GCO network during this maintenance. 

Aug. 30		
From 7:00 - 8:00 p.m., the HR IT team will upgrade NAHOU-NAHRDW01P.  Although this maintenance will result in a total disruption of service to all interfaces into the HRGIM DataWarehouse, no user impact it expected.

Aug. 31		
From 10:00 - 11:00 p.m., Enron Network Services will enable layer 2 connections to the Metropolitan Area Network at Ardmore.   No impact is expected.

Sept. 1		
From 12:00 - 1:00 a.m. (Friday night/Saturday morning) Enron Network Services will add a second gigabit link between core routers ENA-CX1-3405 and ENA-CX2-3405.  This maintenance will cause an outage of 30-45 seconds on the core of the Enron network.  Any devices communicating to a device on another segment will lose connectivity during this maintenance.  Users who are not on the same segment as their servers may experience a disruption of service.  This outage will affect access to Notes, Outlook, Phoneline, and access to the Internet.

Sept. 1		
From 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m., Telephony services will move the MCI/WorldCom cabinet in 3440.  No impact is expected.

Sept. 4		
From 3:00 - 5:00 p.m., the Remote Services team will upgrade the CES2 VPN box.  This change will result in a total disruption of service for users accessing Enron through the VPN.

Sept. 7		
Beginning today, the database for the DSS system will be migrated from GTHOU-SQRPT01P to the ETS Production SAN (GTARD-SQRPT01P).  ODBC drivers for Corp users will be pushed out using the login script.  Updates to ODBC drivers for EES users will be done manually.  The database on GTHOU-SQRPT01P will no longer be available after 9/17.

Sept. 10	
From 8:00 - 9:00 a.m., the HR server team will place an eHRonline server into the DMZ for the click-at-home project.  No impact is expected.

Yes. I have been monitoring BP's FDD balance. Sherry and Chris have been working with someone at BP, filling in for the regular vacationing BP scheduler, and who is unfamiliar with FDD service. Chris and Sherry have taken the over scheduled FDD and rescheduled it into BP's IDD account. Currently BP's FDD is within contract parameters and I will continue to monitor all FDD balances.

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Since we do so much business with ENA I thought I would send out this reminder:

1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.

2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.

3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.

4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.


If you receive any calls regarding dealings with ENA from our customers, please pass them on to me or keep me informed if you should handle these calls.

Thanks,

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking

I just wanted to make sure that these were valid before we close priors tomorrow (6/6).  Let me know if these are not valid.

Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon.

We have a meeting set up with Dave, Don Hawkins and Charlie Thompson to this Friday from 1:00 to 2:00 concerning measurement. I am not sure what the exact topic will be but you are welcome to sit in. Also I plan to distribute a recommendation today concerning the treatment of the 7 and 16 day clocks based upon my understanding of the situation and will copy you.

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.    

						j.  floyd

Subject:	""Legal Essentials for Managers"" Training

	I am pleased to introduce and offer to ETS management -- ""Legal Essentials for Managers"" -- an in-house seminar on compliance with labor and employment laws and the practice of good employee relations.  This 4 hour, interactive program was designed while I headed the Office of Labor and Employment Relations in Corporate HR.  Therefore, it is tailored to Enron's culture and has been further refined to reflect ETS-specific issues.  The target audience are all those persons who have supervisory responsibility.

	The main goals of this session are to help management avoid employment-related litigation, maintain a trouble-free workplace, and maximize employee productivity.  In order to accomplish these goals, it is imperative to understand the intricate connection between sound management practices and legal requirements.

	Some of the topics covered are: maintaining a discrimination and harassment free workplace; the hiring process; compensation issues; performance management; lawful terminations; and all related topics that are necessary to effectively control the risks associated with managing a workforce.

	Now that we are between PRC periods, I believe it is the most opportune time to present this program.  It is no cost to your organization.  My staff and I will make all the necessary logistical arrangements, and travel to field locations to present the session as necessary.  

	All that is needed from you is your support.  Please forward this message throughout your organization and strongly encourage the attendance of all those who supervise employees or advise teams on personnel matters.  In fact, your attendance would set a great example.  I am available to attend any staff meetings to further explain the seminar, and I'd be more than happy to field e-mails, phone calls, or drop-bys.   

	It is my intention to offer as many sessions as necessary to train all management by the end of the year.  Each session is best conducted with about 25 persons.  Thus, with a target audience of approximately 250, this goal can be accomplished in about 10 sessions.

	Below is a schedule of sessions to run from 8:00 - Noon.  Participants are asked to contact my assistant, Miranda Southard, by e-mail to enroll in any of these sessions.  Enrollment will be on a first-come-first-served basis, with enrollment limited to 30 persons per session.  I will leave a date open for Omaha and a date for Denver.  Please let me know which date(s) would be best.  Also, if there is another location that I should target, please let me know that as well.

	Thanks for your support.

"October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status","	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

The new cut code went into production on the evening of the 17th of July, along with the rest of the migration. The reason being, is that it was already written 
into the script and tested. When we found out that there were issue surrounding the new code, it was to late to take out of the script and re-test. So in the
mean time, I have sent a memo to the teams informing them not to use the new code. The new code will not be pulled out of the system until the next migration, which is slated for September 1st time frame. If you have any questions, please ask me. Thank you.

Subject:	RE: OneOk Letter

Drew, I won't be available until around 5pm today.  In lieu of a meeting let me leave you with some comments.

?	I have no objection to the ""special test"" being conducted at the CEESI facilities in Ventura, Ia.  As far as I know they are adequate. But, we would want to have an expert look at them first.  i.e., Instomet and Ken Cessac.
?	When a meter is removed from service at the Rich/Lean Inlet/Outlet then the Rich/Lean plant(s) would have to go down until that meter is tested and reinstalled.  I would assume that they would want to have one outage for all four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days.
?	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
?	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If OneOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an outage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to ""cooperate"" with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the standards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF

Hi Ladies!

I think I have now mentioned to all of you that it would be great to get
together on the Saturday prior to our meeting.  My current thought is to
have the three of you travel together on the ferry from SF to Marin.  I
would pick you up and we could visit the wine country for lunch.  Sound like
a plan?

I'll provide more details later, but here is some important information:
The ferry leaves from SF at 10:45 a.m. (there are other times, but we
wouldn't make lunch).

So, what do you think?  Doable?

Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.

Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.

Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  [Blair, Lynn]  Yes  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a 
storage pt and storage is allocated at a different time? [Blair, Lynn]   A transportation 
delivery directly to  Demarc Def. is a part of the Demarc allocation.  When NNG looks at a storage allocation,
 we review all the  injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point. 

If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]   Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Def. 
The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.?   [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarc Def.

Subject:	Transwestern Invoicing

I have attached a spreadsheet that Elizabeth put together for us for our February invoicing so you can get an idea of the categories and the number of invoices.

These are the 7 categories Elizabeth checks, and how they can be redistributed:

Void Invoices: There are only two of these invoices each month, MSR's can check these, but Marketing will have to communicate when there are additional Invoices that need to be voided.
Delete Line Items: This can also be checked by MSR's but new contracts with these exceptions need to be explained by Marketing to the corresponding MSR for that customer
Volume Adjust: These are also only for exceptional contracts, MSR's can check these exceptions, but Marketing will have to explain exceptions on New Contracts to the corresponding MSR for that customer.
Make-up Volume: MSR's
Adjust Reservation Invoices for change in Credit for Commodity due to make-up: MSR's
Adjust Rate: Marketing
Regenerate Invoice: MSR's

 

We will start checking these for May Accounting,
The TW Team

Subject:	FT. BUFORD CONFIRMATIONS

Lynn,  can we setup a few minutes to discuss the Ft. Buford confirmation processes.  NBPL is wanting to discontinue faxes for Ft. Buford and the ID2 faxes for all NBPL points.  This would require either NBPL or NNG dialing into the others system to confirm (Ft, Buford each cycle) and to verify the final ID2 scheduled numbers daily.  We need to discuss if NNG is willing to make this a practice or not.  I will have Ava setup a time on your calendar some time or get with me early some morning.  We need to see what direction we want to go.

Subject:	Terra Nitrogen Corporation, LE#11781, TransCanada Energy Marketing, agent

Terra is building an outstanding balance due NNG on the A/R, and an explanation is in order for the sequence of events.  With the latest Commodity Close, the A/R will total $528,445.91, which includes a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80 (February).  This will be rolling on to the 30 days' Customer report very shortly.

Earlier this spring, discussions were held with Loren and Frank regarding Terra's contract #104684 and December's transportation invoice.  Scheduled quantities reports for December 2000 through February 2001 were sent for their review.  

The decision was made to repath the December Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $175,507.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties and forwarded accordingly.  In early March, we determined we had monies due Terra and after discussions with Loren, it was agreed we would net all invoices currently on the A/R -- this included the December PPA.   Bill Fowler had talked to TransCanada and left a detailed voicemail for Audie Bremmer, Terra.  The net monies wired to Terra totaled $295,155.36.

In late March, Loren advised us to repath the February Reservation in order to revise the base/variable volumes which resulted in a PPA in the amount of $171,217.80.  A PPA form was signed by all parties for this one as well.  There was no reason to repath January 2001.

In April, Kathy tried to telephone Audie who would not return her call.  His message to her, through his assistant (Maggie), was that he would not pay any invoice without a telephone call from Frank.  This was relayed to Loren and he relayed same to Frank.  As a side note, Frank had seen Audie at some industry function fairly recently and had tried to call Audie -- Audie had not returned his calls.  

In last week's followup with Loren, he relayed that Frank had visited with Dave Neubauer on this issue, and the feeling was that December was closed and we would waive February.  However, Bill Fowler feels February should still stand.  Loren shared there was a similar deal with Minnegasco and they had to pay the revised invoice.  If we allowed the February to be waived, TransCanada would relay that info to Minnegasco.

I plan to talk to Loren again mid-week to update this issue to see if he and Frank feel the timing is acceptable for us to contact Audie.  Should anyone have any questions or suggestions, please advise -- will be in the office 6:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m. this week. 

Thanks,
S.

Conference in New Orleans.  Due to the Terrorist attacks, the conference was
cancelled.  I realize the date 9/26/01 falls outside the deadline for
allowing re-issuance of tickets with non-refundable fares without penalty or
administrative fee.  However, these Enron employees have asked me to
approach Continental on their behalf and request that their tickets be
re-issued to attend the conference on its rescheduled dates (January 16-18,
2002) without penalty.  I will be happy to supply a copy of the
cancellation/reschedule notice sent out by conference director, or any other
supporting documentation that might suffice.

The six travelers/ticket numbers/prices are as follows:
BLAIR/GRACE LYNN / 005-7033562204 / $136.30
CALLANS/NANCY / 005-7033562205 / $136.30
MCDANIAL/JANET / 005-7033562232 / $136.30
JOHNSON/ALICE / 005-7033562301 / $136.30
HERNANDEZ/ALBERT / 005-7033562313 / $184.45
HANAGRIFF/RICHARD / 005-7033399204 / $104.75

Thank you in advance for anything you may be able to do to help these Enron
travelers.

All best,
Elizabeth

Rick/Lynn, we have very few MPS contracts with imbalances and if we do, they are relatively small - Larry B. takes a look at those each month. Because of Close and since we will see Imbalance invoices and DDVC invoices for the first time, tomorrow is always a very busy time - we also may have some last minute measurement corrections to make so I would prefer to have the meeting in the afternoon if we have to have it tomorrow.  Just let us know the criticalness of this and we'll work around you and Rick's schedules.

9:00 may be a bad time for you and I if Shelley has her normal Wednesday staff meeting.  With everything that has gone on today, I believe she will want to meet.  8:30 may be a better time if you are available.
 
Does possible mean probable?  Or was it just a theoretical conversation you had with regulatory affairs?  Esther/Larry should be able to run a report showing us the MPS volumes on contracts.  I do not believe we will find very much volume.

        1.  There may be a 10 day lag on pricing 
        2.  The MPS imbalance volume will be taken out of the tiering denominator 
                calculation. (as well as fuel) 
        3.  We need to run a report to see how oftern (if at all) we have had imbalances on MPS contracts. 

        Do you have any time Wed. morning?  What about 9:00 a.m. in my office?  If that 
        doesn't work we can look at tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks. Lynn

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Subject:	IDD/Park & Ride Transfer

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

Randy,

I have spoken with several contacts at OneOk in the recent past. Just this morning I talked with a Jerry Knight who works together with Delaine Kurth and he is supposed to let me know how the billing, etc. is being handled by WEGO.
Last week Lynn Blair talked with Delaine to see what could be done with the situation of WEGO hauling the so-called water (water is being marked as the substance being hauled on the run tickets, but we have done analysis from two lacations and have found it primarily condensate) from the locations at the Sublette Plant and the Morton Co. #1 dehys. If OneOk is not receiving the revenue from this condensate, then in turn ETS does not receive the BTU replacements for the gas for UAF purposes as our contract states.
We have resolved the issue that was occuring in the same fashion at the Mt. Jesus station and are now being reimbursed by OneOk for this location's BTU replacements. I do not know if they changed trucking services or what, but it has been taken care of.
As far as setting up a face to face meeting with OneOk, that will be determined from OneOk's response to their findings through WEGO and their practices in hauling from these two points.
I will keep you updated as I am informed.

Subject: Liquids in Region

It has come to light, by way of a Wego driver, that Enron has been billed for the liquids that were produced from Oneok facilities.  After further discussion it was discovered that the Hugoton plant as well as some field locations in the Liberal Region are also being billed to Enron instead of Oneok.  This problem may need to be investigated further and a plan to correct this implemented.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts.

Lynn,
After preparing the Storage Summary Sheet this morning I could not save the updated file. In fact the file has disappeared from this solar system. I contacted the Solution Center to have the file restored and was informed that a business reason and director level approval is required before any restoration work can begin. 
As for the business reason, as you know, the NNG Marketing Dept uses this sheet daily to monitor storage activity and as a basis for purchase and sales decisions throughout the month. Marketing expects to see this sheet daily. In addition, Finance has requested a copy of the file daily to help track potential imbalance activity on NNG's system. 
Lynn, Please forward this e-mail to the Solution Center authorizing the restoration of the file at  \\gthou-dv01\common\mkt\oma\sumdec01.xls so I can continue to support the informational needs of the Marketing and Finance Departments provided by the data in the aforementioned file.

I heard a rumor that the Des Moines and Omaha teams have been combined and will now be called the North Team; is this correct?  

Should I be updating PLE to reflect the change?

I believe this generated $75 worth of discretion with Midwest Gas.  Unless I am not seeing something here, I don't feel as though investing dollars to install EFM or Bullhorn would be a good idea.

	Subject:	RE: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

	The charts from these locations are not received in time to process for the 5th work day close, so these daily volumes are determined systematically based on the beginning and ending index readings. Even if they were, it is impossible to determine daily volume consumption from a 31day chart. Even decreasing the chart rotation is not a solution unless charts are received by the third work day to allow sufficient time for processing. The answer is to install EFM or possibly a Bullhorn unit to determine the actual daily index readings so that the daily quantities are accurately determined.. On these types of installations, how can we assess penalties on anything other than monthly quantities ? NNG has several locations where the existing equipment does not meet today?s business needs, so we probably need to determine where these deficiencies exists, and identify the costs to resolve the problem.

			Subject:	FW: Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

			Gary, was wondering if you could help us out. Scott has told me that they have 31 day charts for the stations listed below and he was wondering why we couldn't read those so as to get daily volumes rather than taking the total for the month and dividing it by the number of days in the month to get the daily volume.  The reason for this is because, especially in the winter time, this can become very crucial when we calculate the penalty invoices which are done daily and are based on the differences between the daily physical volumes and the volumes that the shippers have scheduled on our pipe.  If these charts cannot be read daily, what can we do to make it so that they can. Could you please check to find out what we need to do in order to have accurate daily volumes for these stations.

The SMS charges amount to $76.30 but the biggest part of the invoice is the negative DDVC charge which is for $228.40  - this occurred on March 26.  I was wondering if the Midwest Natural Gas people could let us know what they think the volumes should be on those specific wells that they are concerned about for the 26th and then if necessary, we could make those corrections.  Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.

				Subject:	Daily Volumes For Midwest Natural Gas

				I recently met with Jim Banker with Midwest Natural Gas from Whitehall, Wi.  He informed me that he had some concerns about whether or not he was being charged for penalty gas for daily volumes.  He showed me some gas volume statements that he recieved from GMS.  I believe it was the month of March Statement.  What the statement showed is average daily volumes instead of the actual volumes per day. (Ex. At  Eleva TBS Days 1 and 2 showed 122 MCF and Days 3-31  showed 118 MCF.)  These are charted stations with 31 day charts.  The stations that he is concerned about are Arcadia, Eleva, Independance, Mondovi, Strum, Whitehall #1,and  Whitehall #3.  Any assistance or knowledge that you can provide me would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks Scott 612-270-8501

As you know, Mountain Energy Corporation, a shipper on NNG, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  They have three small reservation invoices each month totaling together less than $2000 per month.  

Per Dari Dornan's instructions, I mailed them a certified letter to demonstrate creditworthiness on July 12.  Mountain (or someone) did receive the letter on July 18 and did not respond to Paul Cherry nor I by July 26, as stated in the letter.

Subject:	Global Risk Management Operations Organization Announcement


I am pleased to announce the following changes in the Global Risk Management Operations organization: 

Bob Hall will lead operations for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). 

Brent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. 

I am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. 

Beth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. 

Beth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.

Mike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   

Thanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.

Subject:	October (Forward) Positive Displacement Meter PPA Status

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	JDF Walk for a Cure!



    
Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.  

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a ""JDF Shoe"" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!

Lisa Sawyer

At our meeting yesterday on the Bushton settlement proposal, Phil Lowry led an interesting discussion on the meaning of the ONEOK measurement agreement as interpreted by the arbitrators.  That discussion highlighted the fact that there are still some subtleties about the agreement that may need to be reinforced for those people who have dealings with ONEOK at Bushton.  I'd like to volunteer Britt or myself (whichever is available) to crash your next staff meeting and take a few minutes to discuss the agreement and make sure we are all on the same page.  Rick and Lynn were involved and can help outline scenarios and how they should be resolved.  Thanks--pls let me know when and where (and whether I need to bring donuts).  df

	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage

	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.

		Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team.

		John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

		Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame

	Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.

	Thanks. Lynn

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Debbie,
	All the reports will be available online, EXCEPT for the ones I do manually and specifically for UCU, such as the Daily Allocation report.  However, this report is now being emailed to Keith the day of close, thus preventing the lag time in mailing and data entry on your part.  I am also looking into automating more of the information that we send you for commodity invoicing, such as the required screen prints.  Once this information is automated, I will also be able to send those via email or other methods.  
	As we get closer to production for the system, I will speak with Lynn Blair to see if I can set up a training session in Omaha for you, Keith and possibly Joni.  I'll keep you informed.  Thanks.

Subject: Online Invoicing  System
Debbie,   
    I just wanted to let you  know that NNG will soon be implementing a new online invoicing system.  This will allow UCU to pull their own  invoices and backup off the internet immediately as they become available,r  ather than having the day lag for mailing.  Although the system is somewhats  elf-explanatory, I think some training will be beneficial for everyone  involveddue to the amount of information/reports UCU receives.  
    At this point, we are still  in the testing stage of the new system but I just wanted you to be aware that  this is the direction that the invoicing is goingin the upcoming months.  As the system goes into production, I  will once again contact you to set up a convenient time and location for  training.  If you have any  questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thanks.

Subject:	IDD Scheduling Question

Mike,

Vernon has been talking to Virginia Power about their IDD agreement, and questions arose about the 8 a.m. true up process, SBS, etc.

Vernon explained to them that they must at least have a zero nom path in place in order to be able to true up at the final 8 a.m. process.  I told him that we like to encourage shippers to at least nom as closely as possible to their actual anticipated takes, but that a nomination of zero does count as having an existing path for true up purposes.  Would our preference be a zero nom path over a circular nom?  I told him that I believe we hate to encourage either of these, but if the customer chooses to do one or the other, which is the least harmful to us?
[Bodnar, Michael]  First let me clarify...zero nominations are no longer required for 8 a.m. true-up. You are correct we don't encourage any nominations that merely serve as placeholders. Our preference is to nominate based on best estimate of requirements. 
True-up nominations should not be too significant a number, but should be more of a refinement to minimize out of balance activity. At least that should be the goal...now I know sometimes the true-up nom is quite significant, but hopefully those are exceptions rather than the rule. 
Because the 8 a.m. true-up is a very onerous, manual process that must be completed in a very limited period of time, all parties to the transaction including upstream and downstream parties, and operators must approve the change, before the true-up is scheduled. In addition the change must have approval from NNG Gas Control. New paths are allowed but this becomes a more difficult task if number of parties are needed to approve the change.

If we are in an allocation mode, but we don't allocate the timely process and SBS kicks in, what happens if we allocate subsequent processes?  Does the SBS that was scheduled in the timely process hold, or will it be cut in the next process when a storage allocation occurs?
[Bodnar, Michael]  The activity should hold during subsequent allocation....unless bumped during one of the bump cycles. There is a slight possibility that the activity will be considered incremental but that possibiltly is minimized if there are no changes to the scheduled path.  

I always trip over my own feet when these questions come up.  Can you please set me straight once again?

Thanks,

Kay

In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts.

Drew, I won't be available until around 5pm today.  In lieu of a meeting let me leave you with some comments.

?	I have no objection to the ""special test"" being conducted at the CEESI facilities in Ventura, Ia.  As far as I know they are adequate. But, we would want to have an expert look at them first.  i.e., Instomet and Ken Cessac.
?	When a meter is removed from service at the Rich/Lean Inlet/Outlet then the Rich/Lean plant(s) would have to go down until that meter is tested and reinstalled.  I would assume that they would want to have one outage for all four meters and the total down time for the plant might be several days.
?	Northern will have to restrict C6+ again during this outage.
?	There is no spare meter(s) or spool for any of the Bushton meters.  If OneOK were willing to reimburse NNG (regardless of test outcome), NNG would be willing to purchase and fabricate spare meter spools in order to conduct this test with minimal impact to plant processing.  There would still be an outage of the Bushton Plant but probably only a couple of days.

Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again?

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?

Hey Theresa and Lynn.  I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed getting
to know you two last week and that I hope we can stay in contact.  I
typically just meet Regulatory people in my circle so it's good to know
people who actually know how their pipeline operates!  Lynn - I think I am
finally getting the hang of operating those earrings.  That Tuesday morning
when we were leaving San Fran. the little dangle got cock-eyed and I
couldn't get the earring out to fix it.  At some point at the airport I
managed to get it out.  Am much better now.  Take care and hope to see both
of you soon.

Subject:	Outages on ANR and El Paso

Note:  This may open up opportunity at Greensburg as some ANR injection volumes may have to flow from west to east.
ANR said Monday a previously delayed Southeast Mainline maintenance project between Main Line Valves 9 and 11 is now scheduled for today through Thursday. It will add another 75 MMcf/d of capacity constraint to an ongoing reduction of 100 MMcf/d that will run through the end of August due to compressor maintenance on the Southeast Mainline. 

Note:  This is a large one-day outage.  Have we heard anything about how El Paso is mitigating the effects with their customers?
El Paso will shut down the Window Rock Station on July 27 for Department of Transportation tests and station wiring changes. The work will coincide with modifications to Lines 1205 and 1218 in the San Juan Basin. North Mainline capacity will be reduced by 380 MMcf/d, and no deliveries can be made from El Paso to the ITWWINRK interconnect.

Subject:	IES October SMS Invoice

Chris,

I just got done reviewing some of the data in the October SMS invoice for IES and I can see some major problems.  It looks to me like about 1/2 of the gates have daily estimated usage during the last half of the month which caused us to incur numerous DDVC penalties which I don't believe are correct in both Zone BC and Zone D.

It was obvious that the data was estimated because the flow is almost exactly the same every day for the last two weeks of the month (I suspect it only varies a little due to the BTU factor).  We were getting penalties on the warm days in the second half of the month because you are overestimating the load on those days.  Some of the larger gates to look at include Cherokee(2870), Jefferson(2873), Iowa Falls(2876), Britt(2877) Eldora(2878), Mt Vernon(2880), Vinton(2881) & Alto (3574), but there are many others.

I need to look at this more a lot more, including other months, but before I waste more of my time, I'd like to know how and why these were estimated and if you are already working on a correction.  This is the kind of thing that makes in very difficult for us because we have to rely on your billing data which only is available two weeks after a month ends and that isn't even very good.  The way you are doing it, I don't even understand how you can bill us for DDVC's.

From now on, I think I'd like to get a statement each month of all the estimated data when we get the bill, so we know what to look for.

Thanks,
Jeff

Raetta - Could you please forward this to everyone in market services?
Rosemary - Could you please forward this to everyone in Marketing?

As you may already know, on July 10, NNG again filed with FERC to update our fuel rates in line with our annual PRA
(docket RP01-395).  We filed the same rates that were set up for June 1, then pulled when FERC suspended them for 5 months, pending a Technical Conference.  The new filing asks for the rates to be effective August 1 and has requested FERC approval by July 27 to facilitate early nominations for August business.  After discussing the rate changes with our customers, we are hopeful that the latest filing will be approved.

I do not expect to update the Rate Matrix on the EBB or to load the rates into the system until we receive FERC approval.
The next FERC meeting is Wednesday, July 25.  

If customers want to see the proposed rates, they can consult our Tariff, sheets 54 (fuel & UAF), 54A (exception points), and 61-64 (transport fuel) on the EBB under ""Proposed"" with Effective Date ""August 1, 2001"".

I found your name on the site, I'm guessing you might be the best person to

I'm looking at operational capacity on this site
http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap.html
And I can input the gas day, for today or tomorrow.  But when I get results
back it is ambiguous as to which cycle the gas is flowing in.  Are they all
for the timely cycle or are the evening and intraday cycles thrown in there
as well.  And if they are thrown in there, do I just have to know WHEN the
different cycles are posted and use that as my guide (IE if I'm looking at
results around 14:00 those would be for intraday1 cycle)????

Are you even the person I should ask?

Lynn/Rick, I agree with Dari's comment, although I know that I have been in some conversations regarding this and thought that they knew that they had to nom on a WTG contract in order to get all of the small customer tolerance perks.  We had a similar situation last week with Tenaska, who was nominating for Southern Union (small customer) and I called them back with the MS Rep and explained that they had to nom on a Southern Union contract.  They seemed to be okay with that and I think they will change the way they nom, now.

	Here is what I called about:   WTG is a small customer (Tariff Sheet No. 510) and are entitled to a 1000 MMBtu in tier one of their imbalance rather than the 3%.  However,  WTG Marketing actually was nominating on their own contract for WTG (small customer) and therefore was not receiving the small customer 1000 in tier one.  WTG  feels they were misled by Northern and thought they would receive the 1000 tier one because they were nominating to a small customer point.  If they would have understood that the 1000 Tier One was only applicable to the WTG's (small customer) contract. WTG Marketing would have nom'd as an agent on behalf of WTG (small customer) using WTG's (small customer) contract.

Okay here is the question:  Marketing and Gas Logistics is asking if they can retier retroactively to March 2001 up to current.  We have retiered for other reasons in the past due to our own measurement problems and this also appears to be Northern's ""mistake"" by providing misinformation.  What is your feel for this or  would be better to enter into a ""settlement"" with WTG Marketing so as not to set a precedent.  

Lynn or Janet,  feel free to straighten me out if I have the story confused.

Subject:	Deliveries to Mid 16A - 1707 Pool

Lynn,

I notice that Duke is taking gas from Pony Express in 16A and deilvering it to the Mid 16A - 1707 Pool, which is the pool used for only Bushton Tailgate pooling.  Since Duke is transporting and paying fuel and commodity to deliver there (rather than pooling), I am OK with this from a marketing perspective.  However, since this pool was established to separate Bushton Tailgate gas from other 16A gas, are you OK with this?  Their other alternative is to Pool to Mid 16A pool using MPS for free and then the downstream shipper would have to pay fuel and commodity when they take it away (netting a lower price to Duke).  I don't know if they are meeting some obligation for Tailgate gas using Pony gas as an option.  Let me know what you would like to do.

Thanks!

"FW: K #27291 - Invoices not capturing incremental fees for alternate points","	Team, I realize this rate change is done in Marketing.  But, you have a responsibility
	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
	If you have any questions, please let me know.

This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  

One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,

Subject:	Bushton Plant down 5/26-27

Team,

The Bushton plant went down for abt. 24 hours from the morning of 5/26 until the morning of 5/27.  I talked with Jimmie Mosher and she said they will correct noms. for the differences on those days when everyone is back in the office on Tuesday.

The plant did not notify her that there was a problem, so a timely fix was not an option.  They called our gas control.  I found out when I did the reports for the 26th on Monday, the 28th.

Janet

Alma- please make the appropriate meter station remarks for both Sept & Oct volume statements that the down time was confirmed by Tony Simpson in case Gas Logistics calls and says otherwise----.Our volumes look good for both months so far and we should not be changing anything.

Mike thanks for the info. We show a few hrs on the 4th starting @ 3 AM but the majority begins around noon

Just heard from Jim Westbrook and he confirmed that our meter is OK - the plant was down for expansion so the 0's are good.   Should start seeing some volumes with the gas day of the 4th.

Bill Anderson with U.S. Energy was convinced that they had been taking gas during this time.  Tony Simpson with Exol confirmed that they had not.

Will close the ticket.

We have been under burning at the Great Lakes - Carlton Interconnect for the past few days.   Gas Control was seeing what appeared to be a good flow rate but due to a calibration error between our Seimens Controller at Carlton and the Great Lakes computer we have actually been under burning.    The Control Tech - Roger Salmi - is performing a calibration now and we should be sync'd up with Great Lakes this afternoon.

I have passed this to Gas Control and they will make the necessary adjustments to correct the imbalance once Roger has completed the calibration.

Due to the June 1 changes in Shelley's organization, I'll need your
timekeepers to give me your new payroll distribution percentages.  I'm
preparing a new ""budget"" for Shelley, and would appreciate this
information by the end of this week if possible.

Sheila, I'm sorry I didn't respond to your call last week.  I was on
vacation, and forgot to change my phone greeting.
Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,

Lynn,

This does cause me a good deal of concern.  Kathy does not know that much of what I do and we do not share customers as Harry & I have done.  She is also new again to scheduling, so all those facets of my performance would be missing.  I might add that at midyear Harry was also unavailable for my review, and yet because of our close proximity, he knows better than anyone on the team how I spend my days.  At the end of the day, none of this may matter, but it is a concern today.

Thank you for your consideration.

Janet

	On TW, TW allocated SoCal on the ID2 cycle for Sunday's gas day, due to SoCal non performance.
	We cut about 27,000 mmbtu.

	The Sequel 2000 conversion on the reports went well.  Brad's team was here to help Sunday morning
	and I believe that made things go smoother.  There were a few isolated situations which were turned

"FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes","            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequently, his last day with us will be today.
 
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start working for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two familiar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
 
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had asked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finalized on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was unable to communicate Robert's decision until now.  
 
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the loss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.

	Due to all the teams being on different floors, I am very concerned about coverage
	by John and Terry to accommodate all the team needs.

	Here is a plan I would like to propose for now through March, 2002.

		Terry concentrates on all TW issues and testing since he will be on 13 with the team.

		John concentrates on NNG North end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

		Mike concentrates on NNG South end and testing since he will be on 42 with the NNG team

	As each of you are on vacation, then the other 2 will cover your area.

		Another option is to have Larry and Raetta help out with the NNG teams during this time frame

	Let's discuss on Wednesday after you have had a day to think about this.

	Thanks. Lynn

"Re: Deliveries to Mid 16A - 1707 Pool","Per Terry's comments, we have the ""blocks"" in the system to prevent
any shipper from going to 16A back into the ""Bushton Universe"".  As long
as that block is in place, we are OK with Duke using 16A for pooling purposes.
Hopefully this answers your question.  If not let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Deliveries to Mid 16A - 1707 Pool

Lynn,

I notice that Duke is taking gas from Pony Express in 16A and deilvering it to the Mid 16A - 1707 Pool, which is the pool used for only Bushton Tailgate pooling.  Since Duke is transporting and paying fuel and commodity to deliver there (rather than pooling), I am OK with this from a marketing perspective.  However, since this pool was established to separate Bushton Tailgate gas from other 16A gas, are you OK with this?  Their other alternative is to Pool to Mid 16A pool using MPS for free and then the downstream shipper would have to pay fuel and commodity when they take it away (netting a lower price to Duke).  I don't know if they are meeting some obligation for Tailgate gas using Pony gas as an option.  Let me know what you would like to do.

Thanks!

Lynn, I have no problem with Shirley, however, since she has began working from home, I have had limited interaction with her due to our work schedules.  She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry).  Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team that I work with more closely, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.

I spoke with the software vendor today about the rounding issue that is high on everyone's radar screen.

I have also strongly expressed our need, want  and desire to have this accomplished before closing the August business. All indications to date are that this will be implemented prior to close. In the event that unforeseen circumstances prevent this from happening, I will let you know.

Chris,
Gary Anderson has implemented a change request for reporting volumes to the customer. The requested change would have the volume statements round the same as the daily extract files.
There won't be adjustments made for the June volumes, instead, when the change goes in, the volume statements in June will reflect the rounded volume.
I don't know the exact time estimate for this change but it won't be in before the July close. You will be hearing more about this in the future.
Thanks to ya'll for being so patient with us.
Jeff

Gary,
I hope I have stated this correctly and if you have any comments they would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff,

Last month  after our Commodity close NNG has had customers calling with differences in the volumes we reported verses the volumes that Gas Measurement reported for the month of June 2001.  I think you are aware there  is a rounding issue with the volumes due to the decimals in the new PGAS system.  I don't know if this problem has been resolved or not but since July's close is quickly approaching I was wondering if you could give me the status on this problem and also if there will be adjustments made to the June volumes in PGAS to reflect the same volumes that we reported to our Customers? We appreciate all the efforts that you and Gas Measurement have made to make this transition period as smooth as possible,  thanks  for your assistance and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Chris Greaney

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	""On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000.""

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Subject: Robert Bryan


 
Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequently, his last day with us will be today.
 
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start working for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two familiar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
 
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had asked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finalized on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was unable to communicate Robert's decision until now.  
 
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the loss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.

Lynn,  

I had a request from Darrell to set him up with update capabilities to nominations, confirmations and scheduled quantities.  Currently I have both Gary and Darrell set up with update capabilities to the process control and inquiry to all of the TMS screens.  Let me know if you are OK with them having any kind of update capabilites and I will get a form together for your approval.

Thanks,

"Weekend","	
	Shelley, things were quite on NNG and TW overall for the weekend.

	For all three pipes the reps had to go through RAZ to get into TMS on Saturday morning.
	Although, the customers were able to get in OK, but the system was slow.  System was fixed by 11:30 a.m. 
	Saturday morning.

	On TW - For Gallop Darrell has sent you an update.

	Overall for TW the prices for the east are not covering variables to go west, therefore
	most of the gas is staying in the east market.

	Thanks. Lynn

Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.  Workplace harassment conflicts with Enron's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

The date and times available for sessions are:


Day	Date	Session I	Session II	Session III	
Wednesday	Sept 19	1:30 - 2:45	3:00 - 4:15	4:30 - 5:45	
Wednesday	Sept 26	1:30 - 2:45	3:00 - 4:15	4:30 - 5:45

Importance:	High

On behalf of Dave Neubauer,Frank Semin, Lynn Blair and Jodie Floyd:

In follow-up to our conference call Thursday morning, we would like to communicate the ""To-dos"" we are recommending.  It is very important that we get the charts to Houston by the 3rd business day of the month.  We need to encourage chart changers to get their charts in the mail immediately.  As the charts are received in Houston, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services will be in charge of not only inputting the chart data, but also tracking and keeping a report on when each chart is received.  Once we determine which charts are consistently late, we will determine what action needs to be taken to get the charts in on time, whether it be Priority Mail Service or Overnight Service.  Prior Period Adjustments will be done on each chart that is received late.  As we continue to work through this problem, ongoing research and planning will be done to ensure that a capital commitment is made to get technology installed to eliminate this ongoing issue.

1) It is important that the Operations personnel communicate to the chart changers the importance of getting the charts in the mail box immediately.
2) Effective immediately, it is recommended that Gas Measurement Services track the receipt of the charts and provide a report to Gas Logistics (Jodie Floyd) and Marketing that details which charts aren't coming in on time.  We need to have the report shortly after GMS closes, so that we can make efforts to locate the missing charts and get them to Houston as soon as possible.
3) Once we identify the charts that we are coming in late, we will provide either Priority Mail envelopes or Overnight envelopes to those stations so we can ensure that the chart will be on time the following month.
4) PPAs will continue on all charts that are received late.
5) Measurement will review possible technology to improve the accuracy of our measurements, i.e. temperature-based calculation, chart delineator.

If you have any questions, please contact Courtney Barker (Marketing) at (402) 398-7130 or Jodie Floyd (Gas Logistics) at (713) 853-1465.

Please forward this on to any necessary personnel.

I would like to schedule a meeting for Thursday, June 21st to review the Daily Imbalance Report Ken Powers has been developing.  The report compares the ""paper"" volumes with the ""physical"" volumes on TW on a daily basis.  This report has been developed as a tool for managing TW's linepack.  The next step will be to develop some financial analysis tools to use in conjunction with this report to help TW make operational and financial decisions on a daily basis concerning management of our OBA's, PNR and fuel.

Please let me know as soon as possible if 10:00 would be good for you or if another time on Thursday would be better.

June 1 instead of May 31.  At some point in time we may move back to the last day of the month.  This would be 
after we have (1) automated the manual process or (2) managed to speed up the manual process to effectively

Subject:	RE: Determination of Invoice Date/Due date

Ray - The only tariff provisions state that ""Transporter shall render  invoices to Shippers no later than the tenth (10th) day of the month following the month to which the charges or credits apply ..."" (Sheet 134).  The payment provisions (also on Sheet 134) state that ""Unless otherwise agreed, Shipper shall pay Transporter ...on or before the tenth (10th) day after written transmission of ivoice..."" .
There is nothing else in the tariff which could be used to programatically determine invoice dates but the invoice due date would be 10 days after the invoice is transmitted.  In discussions with market services,  I believe that they intend to send out the FTS-2 reservation invoices on the first day of the month rather than the last day of the production month because of complications in administering some rate cap provisions agreed to in the Phase IV Settlement.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  -  Teb

Subject:	Determination of Invoice Date/Due date

	Teb,

	In our accounting discussions were are trying to determine the correct rules for programtically determining the Invoice date and Invoice due date.

	For reservation and commodity, is there a set of rules we can apply to determine each of these dates? Today the invoice date is entered prior to 
	the invoices being finalled.  We would like to eliminate this step.

	It appears, on reservation, the invoice date is the last day of the production month.  So for Febraury production month for example, reservation 
	invoices had an Invoice Date of February 28,2001 and a due date 10 calendar days after that, March 10,2001.

	Thanks for any help you can give us.

	Ray

"FW: Questions on MDQ","	Is the volume at the inlet and outlet of Bushton factored into any MDQ total?  Gerry
	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

sent us last night took 13 hours to load (I am not sure it ever loaded).
I know Jeff is diligently working on this, hopefully he can get this fixed
this weekend.  Tammy has a call into Jeff to see if we need someone available
this weekend to help test.  Thanks again for your support and follow up.

Subject:	EDI files

Tammy & Jesse,

Just wanted to touch base with you on todays activities.
We have address the problem with Utilicorp and you will now see 40 records on all meters.
A test file has been sent and Jesse notified. Please let me know of any further problems
that may develope on this file.
Jesse has notified me that the Entex file had a problem and will let me know what the point 
of failure item is. We will move to correct this immediately.
I have not heard if there were any problems with the Texaco files.

Any problem that we find will any EDI file will be resolved and that resolution will be implemeted 
for ALL EDI files. Like the 40 record problem on Utilicorp.

I want to be sure and emphisize that EDI is our top priority right now and we have every intention
to have these files ready on close night. If by some chance we still have problems the night of close
we will continue to resolve them to get the files out ASAP. Unlike the MIPS system, PGAS enables
us to run the EDI file over and over till we have what we need from the system. As long as the customers 
knows that we are redeveloping the file we send them they should understand that there MAY be a 
delay in them getting their data. I do not intend for this to occur but they may need a heads up if you
have not already done that. 
The backup plan for all of this is fairly simple, Other than a copy of the statements there is not one.
Going back to MIPS is not an option. The June data has not been entered into MIPS(except EFM)
and will not be available. Utilicorp already receives a number of copies of the statements. If there is 
someone or some department that would also need a copy in the event of a delay in the file we will sent 
it to them.

If you have any questions regarding the EDI files please feel free to contact me.
I am currently working an afternoon to evening shift so will not be available in the morning
except by pager.(713-813-8096)
Tks, Jeff

		Ladies & Gentlemen:

		At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

		Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

		I appreciate your patience.	

		Many thanks.

		Britt

Subject:	RE: LS Power/Cogentrix injection overrun allocation question 

Tim,
I can't find a single date when LSP's  overrun injections were cut completely. The LSP - Whitewater FDD contract has had 27 days this injection season where, at the end of the gas day, overrun injections are scheduled. I have found an example where USES tried to increase their nomination during the gas day. However all the available capacity had been scheduled during an earlier process cycle. When this occurs, no incremental injections can be scheduled unless incremental capacity becomes available. Another problem is that at the end of most gas days USES utilizes storage netting to further complicate the analysis.
I really need more to go on. If USES can provide a date or dates it would help our analysis.

Subject:	RE: LS Power/Cogentrix injection overrun allocation question 

 << File: lspoverrun.xls >> Tim,

Please find attached a summary showing the injection overrun volumes LSP scheduled on their FDD contracts 23281 and 23282 during the injection months of June, July and August 2001.

Since the storage allocation is administered in Market Services, I have asked Mike Bodnar to look into specifics of the days allocated vs. LS Power's overrun volumes.  I did do one quick spot check of a day where we allocated storage through the Intraday 2 process, and I found that LSP did indeed schedule injection overrun quantities on that day.  Specifically, I looked at the gas day of September 1, 2001.  I note that LSP schedule 7,825 mmbtu on an MDQ of 3,008 on contract 23281, and they scheduled 5,945 mmbtu on an MDQ of 3,560 on contract 23282 on Sept 1st.  I'm not sure that it is accurate to say they are never getting any injection overrun on days we allocate storage.  I can tell you that I think the allocation process is working correctly, but I'll let Mike speak to these issues further.

Hope this helps!

Kay

Importance:	High



Kay,

Bill Anderson from US Energy mentioned to Kent and I at the KC Operations meeting that his FDD injection overrun volumes are being cut completely when there is a storage allocation.  At first, I thought this was due to a discounted injection overrun rate being charged to LS Power/Cogentrix.  However, you confirmed yesterday that LS Power/Cogentrix is paying the full injection overrun rate, and therefore should get a pro-rata piece of the available capacity at the time of the allocation.  

I told Bill that we would look into our allocation process, and find out why LS Power/Cogentrix was being cut completely.  Could you let me know if you find anything incorrect in our allocation process with regards to the LS Power/Cogentrix account?  Perhaps LS Power/Cogentrix is entered into the allocation system incorrectly as a discounted rate?  

Please let me know what you find.  I would like to respond to Bill as soon as possible.

Thanks!!

Tim Johanson

Please forward the following message to NNG reps:


On Wednesday, July 11, Wisconsin Gas will begin sending EDI confirmations to NNG at all points that they confirm.  The first EDI file should come in for the July 12 Timely Cycle.  Wisconsin Gas will send NNG the confirmation and NNG will respond with the confirmation response and, if applicable, an unsolicited response on line items NNG has that Wisconsin Gas did not send.  Wisconsin Gas will not be sending a confirmation response quick response.  This confirmation process will be similar to WEPCO's confirmation process.

Subject:	Ft. Buford Measurement Facilities Agreement - Comments


I went over my Ft. Buford example with Scott.  He is comfortable that the present arrangement is fair to Border.
He was also concerned that NNG should not get into a problem with fuel.  Based on my conversations with Dan Fancler and my knowledge of the PRA process, I believe that fuel is being properly accounted for and retained (assuming Marketing believes that Bearpaw really is selling the gas to other shippers on NBPL who will bring an equivalent amount of gas back to NNG at Ventura or one of the other NNG/NBPL interconnects.)

I'm confused about the proposed Measurement Agreement vs. what we are currently doing.
It appears to change what is currently happening.  Do we want to do that if we think the current arrangement is working?
If so, we need to talk to Dan about how the accounting would need to change.

Paragraph 1:

During the month, the same number is scheduled & confirmed as received at Ft. Buford and delivered to Border, 
with no reduction for fuel & unaccounted for.

When actual measured volumes are available, the total quantity of gas measured through the suction side meters (WBI plus Bearpaw meters) is the quantity deemed to have been received into Fort Buford.  For the  (Bearpaw & whoever is coming in thru WBI), whatever is measured on the suction side is deemed to be delivered to Border with no reduction for fuel.
Any difference between metered receipts and scheduled volumes goes on NNG's OBAs with Bearpaw and WBI.

However, for Border, the actual quantity deemed delivered out of Ft. Buford and into Border is the total receipt quantity LESS 1.66% fuel (which may be change from time to time to reflect the configuration and operation of the station) .  

Paragraph 3.
Northern, not Border, does the fuel calculation.  NNG's measurement system takes the total quantity of gas measured thru the suction side meters less a use and unaccounted percentage (currently 1.66%).  The result becomes the quantity delivered into Border at Ft. Buford.

The calculated fuel amount is booked by Dan Fancler/Kasey Davis as part of the Market Area fuel consumed and is recovered under the PRA as part of NNG's Market Area fuel rate.  

Do we need to provide Border with a month end summary of fuel used if the number we use for their actual delivered volume does not include fuel?

Paragraph 4
(This doesn't affect the agreement, but it's something NNG should consider.)
If NNG makes changes at Ft. Buford to increase the capacity as proposed, won't we need to recalculate the appropriate fuel rate?

Paragraph 5
NNG does not need to reimburse Northern Border for use and unaccounted gas since we deduct the fuel from the number used as the actual delivery to Border at Ft. Buford.

Any difference between the deliveries scheduled into Border and the actual metered volume (less fuel) is booked to the NNG/NBPL OBA at Ft. Buford, netted with amounts on OBAs at the other NBPL/NNG interconnects  and settled in-kind at any of the Parties' interconnects (usually Ventura).

GENERAL
The advantage that I see to the present method is that the volume on the delivery meter at Ft. Buford into Border 
is realistic in that its volume is the receipt volume less our best guess at what is burned at Buford for fuel and never
really reaches Border.

Yesterday we noticed a problem where reports were not reporting on the correct cycle, or were not picking up information between cycles.  As it turns out, an important table was not being replicated from the application database to the reporting database.  

I was told that this problem has been fixed, and on first inspection of the tables, everything looks correct.

Lynn:  Please verify that if Koch realigns their 35,000/d contract (K# 20510)such that their MDQ at Carlton matches their Carlton flow obligation of 2,828 and has the rest of their 32,172/d at Marshall (They would need to realign 30 mcf from Carlton to Marshall to effectuate the above, and I've checked with Doug Aschwege to make sure he would approve it.) that Steve's and my interpretation as described below is correct.  Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips

   Lynn,
   I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that
   you
   could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background
   and
   the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
   understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
   pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
   supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
   experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do
   you
   think?

      Are
      you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
      important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this

         Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
      meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
         ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
      Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
         group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
      Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
         email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
      Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
         Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
      cancellation.

         One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
      ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
         pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
      the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
         if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these
      mismatches.  If you would like
         to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

         Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
      Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	TMS Oncall Support

All,
After talking it over with Lynn Blair, and with Sheila Nacey's agreement, the TMS Oncall support hours are being modified.  Instead of the current rotation that requires 2 developers to be oncall each working day plus a third person fulfilling the responsibility on the weekend, the TMS team is experimenting with a rotation of one oncall person for work days and one for the weekend.  The TMS team will still continue to provide oncall support from 6:30A to the end of the last cycle.

The only noticeable change during this 6 week experiment will be the onsite support hours, which will now be from 6:30A to 6:00P.  Following is an outline for oncall procedure during this period:

1)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide on-site support from 6:30A to 2:00P
	At times when the Oncall does not feel comfortable about being able to commute to office before 6:30A, the Oncall will 	provide support from home until he/she is able to hand off the responsibility to TMS team member onsite.
2)  TMS team, collectively, will provide the on-site support from 2:00P to 6:00P
	Before leaving, the Oncall person will make sure that one of the team member, already on-site, has accepted the 	responsibility for answering oncall pages
3)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide off-site support from 6:00P to the end of processing for last cycle

There will be no change to the weekend oncall procedures.

John/Terry,
please make sure that all schedulers are aware of the above change.

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.  

Thanks

Lynn, We received a call that indicates Enron Compressor Services is not in Bankruptcy.  The TW gas may need to move on a Enron Compressor Services contract, or we may need to schedule the gas on an ENA receipt contract and cashout the imbalance.  If ENA can not move the gas, the gas that ENA leaves on the system will need to be sold by TW.  Not sure if ENA has a market to move the gas.

The NNG Compressor Services gas is still being scheduled.  2,010 dt/day

James Centilli is working with Mark K. and Greg Porter and may know more.  We need to meet to discuss how this contract goes forward.

Subject:	Communication Alternatives in Crisis/Disaster/Outage Situations

In Shelley's staff meeting this morning, she expressed concern about situations (like the one we are currently experiencing) in regard to e-mail and electronic communication channel availability to customers.  Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team.  In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges.  With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term;  

1.)  An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access.  Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming.  A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed.  The service should be available from remote locations.  I am currently investigating this issue.  (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 

2.)  A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information.  There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties.  The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. 

I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  

Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Alma, please invite those on the ""To"" distribution.

Rick and Lynn,

Raetta and I heard from the mailroom early this afternoon that UPS was suspending service with Enron.  We discussed other options and decided to inquire with UPS or Fed Ex about opening an account thru NNG.

When I contacted UPS, I discovered that UPS is resuming service with Enron today.  The mailroom is aware of the situation.

I talked to Lavila Lawrence with Duke Energy Field Services, LP. and she advised me that the GPM Dumas Plant (POI 18058) is going to be shutdown effective January 1, 2002.  They will diverting some of the gas to other pipelines and any gas that will be coming to NNG will come through interconnects that David Moon takes care of in the Texas Panhandle.  

She said ""They wouldn't have to de-rhime that plant anymore!"", which gave me the impression that the cost of maintenance might be the reason for the shutdown.

Any questions, please call.

Rick this is the result of the problem I discovered when we first went to PGAS.    I turned it over to Dale Ratliff for NNG and passed it to Jeff May to verify.   I am not sure if this will not become a different issue further down the road when we will possibly want to provide the customer with as close to real time EFM data as possible.   There will be a time that we will probably have the capability to show numerous EFM data accumulation updates during the current gas day.  That is one of the advantages of PGAS.

The change has been implemented to drop the CURRENT day from the extract process. In this case, today is the 19th and there are NO daily records for the 19th in the file. Processing has just completed and this has been verified. Earlier today I contacted the oncall person for each company and let them know that the change had been implemeted and that no impact was expected to their processing. But, just in case, if there was a problem it may be associated with this change. I have no doubt that if there is a problem, everyone has my number. It's like an old worn out shoe.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Lynn,

Koch is the agent for IES nominations.

On the accounting side, IES pays their own invoices.  WP&L, Interstate Power, IEA and IES are all under Alliant, but they operate independently.

Kathy Washington currently handles the scheduling for IES since she handles Koch, and also IES accounting since they pay their own invoices.  However, each month Kathy Washington gives the IES invoices to Jean to include with Alliant's mailout.

Hope this explains everything!

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Attached is the SoCalGas response of our mild protest to their advice  letter 2837-A.  The relevant language is on page 5 of their letter and has  been highlighted for your convenience.  In part, they state that:   
 
""These types of reductions are no different from today's  practice of allowing customers to reduce nominations in the fourth scheduling  cycle.  The flaw is not in SoCalGas  new procedures.  SoCalGas provides  customers with notice of an upcoming OFO two hours prior to scheduling cycle  closing times.  Within those two  hours, customers can make changes to their nominations and still meet the  scheduling timeline as defined by GISB standards.  Even if SoCalGas cuts nominations in  cycle four because customer reductions don't reduce deliveries enough to avoid  operational problems, changes in cycle 4 are within GISB standards.  Transwestern is supposed to be complying  with those GISB standards and seems to state that it is unable to do  so.""
 
They go on to state a willingness to  work with us on the issue.  There is no procedural option for us to respond  to their response.  At this point, our option is to meet with Energy  Division staff to discuss the issue further, should we feel the need to do  so.  
 
Have a good weekend!

Jean sent an e-mail reporting they are fine and expect to debark in Vancouver on Saturday.  Hopefully air travel and normalcy (as much as possible) will have been restored by then.  She will keep us posted.

Any questions, please advise--thanks!

Subject: RE: Zone Allocations


To help clarify, a storage withdrawal reduction essentially created the same physical effect as would an injection during the recent storage allocations.

For example: If the storage fields had a net injection on a given day of 100 dth(physical maximum)and at the 8:00 a.m. cycle an injection increased by 25 dth, it would be denied because of the physical limitations. The same limitation would occur if a withdraw was reduced by 25 dth (creating a net 125 dth injection) at the 8:00 a.m. process because the same physical limitation existing.   
		Injections	(150)
		Withdrawals	 50	
		Net 		(100) physical limitation	
Trying to reduce a redraw of 25 dth would create:
		Injections  (150)
		Withdrawals   25
		Net		(125) physically above the limitation and would be allocated.

The intra-day process are interative, that is FDD withdrawals/injections can impact the interruptible storage availability during the intra-day cycles, whereas the 8:00 a.m. process is only a individual true-up and not interative with the other storage agreements.

Lynn and Chris would gladly schedule some time to help clarify these issues, and I am sure it will be a lot more informative than my attempt here.

It may be standard practice in your opinion, but Kelly, Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us.  Also Entergy-Koch was completely surprised by it as well.  We just can't understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection.  Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection.  We'd like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better.  We pulled looked at the 8 a.m. process instructions on the web and it doesn't say anything about this.

What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldn't do what we thought we had a right to do, even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination.  On top of that, no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the 11/15 gas day if we hadn't been lucky enough to have found it on our own.  We pushed the gas across to ANR, but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result.  The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated, but you can't do it at 8 a.m.  It just doesn't make any sense to us.


>>> ""Sebesta, Chris"" <Chris.Sebesta@enron.com> 11/16/01 10:32AM >>>
Jeff, I am sorry WP&L and IES are experiencing allocation problems.  It
is standard procedure during a storage (injection) allocation the 8 am
true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage
injections.  Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their
business.  Other than getting truer information on your market's needs
or finding alternate markets for your excess capacity, I don't have any
other ideas on how to address your zone allocations.

As requested I will add this item to our December 10 meeting agenda.

Chris

You should know that we are unhappy about something else now.  For the
11/14 gas day you (NNG) did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal
nomination to zero in the 8 am process like normal because of a storage
injection allocation.  Because of this WP&L is going to get hit with SUL
DDVC penalties. Entergy-Koch who handles the IES assests was surprised
by this as well and IES may incur penalties too.

We weren't trying to make an injection, we were just trying to cut our
withdrawal to zero.  We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the
winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we
have been seeing lately.  We've had conference call with Jean Blair and
Jerry Wilkens on the topic.  We are also in trouble now for the 11/15
gas day, which we are current trying to figure a way out of.  You can
add this item to our discussion topics when you visit.

		Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name is on the list.
		Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the list
		and added the new people.  

		Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on
		this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?

		Thanks. Lynn

John and I discussed a couple of Bushton Measurement issues today that I would like you to take a lead on.

* According to John, the difference between their PTR and our meters seems to be abnormal for April and May of this year.  He will designate a ONEOK expert to call Ken Cessac to discuss possible investigations to resolve, if possible.  I would include an examination of the Plant PTR process and not just a limitation to Ultrasonic Meter Issues.


* John has expressed a concern for the need to add further clarification to the Measurement Agreement.  He foresees some issues that may not be addressed in the agreement.  I told him that I thought it would be better to resolve these issues before they became a problem and agreed to listen to their concerns and work to resolve if possible.

Importance:	High

Ramona,

I sent her the approximate times the TW cycles are completed last week (below).  The issue she is having now is when to post.

1.  After the cycle is complete   or
2.  After confirmations are available. 

Today we currently generate a new posting for Operationally Available every 15 minutes to keep it constantly updated. But if we go to 4 times daily, when does she set the time to generate and post?  I'm probably not the one to answer this.  Someone needs to make the call which of the two times would be correct one to post.  Another issue is when we have system problems and the time gets thrown off and it has a set time to run, wouldn't this skew the available capacity numbers?


This was my e-mail to Jeanie last week..........


They are generally set times, but there are times when we are having (TMS) system problems that the times have to be pushed up. But as a general rule the times that TMS cycles run are:  (This is for TW)
Evening Cycle: Runs at approximately 6:00 -  6:30 p.m and confirmations run at approximately 9:00p.m.
Non Grid: Runs at approximately 8:00 - 8:30 a.m. 
Intraday 1: Runs at approximately 10:00 - 10:30a.m. confirmations run at approximately 1:00p.m.
Intraday 2:  Runs at approximately 5:00 - 5:30 p.m. confirmations run at approximately 8:00p.m.
Timely:  Runs at approximately 11:30 a.m  - 12:05 p.m. confirmations run at approximately 3:30p.m.

Subject:	RE: Unsubscribed Capacity Posting Schedule

Ramona,
Operational and Design Capacity Postings to the Internet and thru EDI is already implemented in Production and to my knowledge does not have any issues that I am aware of in regards to the schedules. 

The schedule for posting that I am referring to is for Unsubscribed Capacity. The meetings that were held with regards to Unsubscribed Capacity included what to post, for how long and and the frequency of the postings. Today, Perry maintains and updates his Excel spreadsheet and the Internet team posts the Unsubscribed capacity every hour. In one of our meetings, it was decided that we would post 4 times a day with the automated feature rather than every hour. From that I am trying to determine the times so that I can create an automated schedule to have this data available. The schedule really only applies to the Internet postings. EDI's schedule is when the customer sends in a request for data.  If you can coordinate and finalize this schedule while Dale is out, it will help us move forward. If you have any other questions, please call me as Tina is also out of the office until Tuesday.
Thanks,
Jeanne

Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to help follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cycle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is different on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocation is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule volumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confirms. 

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting Unsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operational available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after each cycle. 
Please let me know.
Thanks Ramona

"NNG - South End Small customer deliveries","
	Penny and Michelle, I met with Larry Berger, Terry Kowalke and Raetta Zadow this morning
	to review yesterday's meeting on the concerns for DDVC's at ""small customer delivery points""
	on the southend of NNG's system. Through our discussions, here are a few ideas including some
	of yesterday's discussion.  These ideas may be somewhat out of the norm, but we thought we
	would at least  throw them on the table.

	1.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should agree with us to lift the requirement
	     that the supply has to be upstream of the delivery in the Bushton Universe.  It can still be
	     required in the ""Bushton Universe"", just not as restrictive as it is today.

	2.  If Oneok cannot supply these deliveries, then Oneok should allow us to do storage true ups
	     at 8:00 a.m. at the end of the gas day to eliminate DDVC.

	3.  If these deliveries are on Firm contracts, can we sell them SMS to cover these small volumes
	     even though they are in the field area?

	4.  Richfield Storage point - (I am not sure it is even active)  -  Could we get Oneok to agree to 
	     allow true ups if we are supplying the true up with gas coming from the Richfield storage point?
	     I am sure this alternative would need to include the storage group.

	We would be glad to participate in any future discussions.  Thanks. Lynn

"Demarc Allocation Conference Call - 11/06/01","	
  	Greg, it was good to visit with you yesterday.  Here are the questions and answers that we promised you 
	at the conference call on Tuesday, November 6.  Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.

	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?

		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount
			  (2) RANK changed to a different number

	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

		Answer - Tariff Sheet 268, D & E 

	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?

		Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group

	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power
	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation
			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from
		              the field to the market area. (Greg we may not have been clear on this comment
			  on the conference call)

Gerry,

Per your request, this is a reminder to a conversation we had regarding the priority of SBA shippers at a given point during the allocation of that point.  It was discussed  and agreed that SBA shippers trying to pack/peak the system should be given priority over Alternate and Interruptible during an allocation.  

In September, we will resume the Pack & Draft activity and it would be helpful to have this procedure  in place.  Let me know if there is any other information that you need.

Thank you for your help in this matter.

Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.

Lynn, how would we handle this Accounting wise? Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not. We need to get this situation stopped. They should blow gas upstream of the meter.  Gary, can you check with Bandel and get an approximate volume that has been vented? Richard, great job in bringing this to our attention. sj

Subject:	Warren Eunice

It was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Thanks, Jane

	I'd like to confirm that we have a green light from you to do a prototype of the TMS report that we discussed yesterday. Depending on the complexity of the data it should take us 1-2 weeks to finish a prototype of the report, the universe, and the TMS integration piece. Please let me know if you are ok with this. If the answer is yes, who do we charge our time to?

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.    

						j.  floyd

Please review and let me know if you would like me to change anything you are not comfortable with before I send out to Virginia Power. (I am still waiting on the cities from Gas Control). Jo, you wanted me to get the Plainview South number from planning but see if the way I worded the reponse works.  I will get back to him separately on the fuel language response.

Thanks!

Lynn,
We really need to start the X12 exchanges -- I am sure you will agree in
light of the events over the weekend.  I will push from my end and hopefully
you can push from yours and we can make this happen!

(Hope I see you at the Interconnect Meeting in October.)  I told Cheryl
Snyder to be sure both us were on her invitee list.  I think she'll be
sending out the notice soon.

Happy 4th from Colorado Springs,
Kathy

Tammy and Mike,

What's the status of our X12 file exchange?  Are we ready to implement
this?


Due to the latest problems in communication between our schedulers, we
probably should get this in place as soon as possible.  I believe it
would
streamline the confirmation process between our two pipes.

Let me know what I can do on this side to expedite getting this
going....

Kathy

Subject:	EDI Measurement Update

Provided below are some bullets outlining today's events.  The fact that we can now translate the EDI file is a giant step forward in the testing process.  Jesse and Jeff has done an outstanding job of getting us to this next step today.  

Let Utilicorp know we are committed to our delivery date of Wednesday.
For the Utilicorp file,  the biggest problem was the missing 40 records.  The 40 record contains the volume (quantity).  When the 40 record is missing, the translator stops processing the file so no file is sent to Utilicorp.  By Friday afternoon,  the problem with the 40 record has been resolved for testing.   
The trailer record is incorrectly being sent as a 40 record. Jeff will have David fix it from home and resend this weekend.  
Now that the files are able to be translated.  I will review test files for any data issues and report results.
The HPL file sent to Texaco contains several occurrences of a ""?"" in the tube inside diameter, tap type, and meter type fields.  When this situation occurs, the meters' with the ""?"" are sent to an error directory.  The error directory information is sent to the Measurement department to correct.  Once the data is corrected, the meters will be resent.   I am trying to find someone to take ownership for HPL since Enron sold it.  

Regards,

Tammy

Subject:	Maintenance Notes on El Paso, ANR, NOVA, and NGPL

Transportation Notes 
Saying linepack had stabilized, El Paso canceled an Unauthorized Overpull Penalty alert Wednesday, one day after it had gone into effect. The pipeline also said it will take Line 1100 between the Eunice and Pecos River stations down for repairs June 26. Six interconnects will be unable to deliver into El Paso that day, and the total flow of gas through Eunice Station to the South Mainline will be limited to 245 MMcf/d. Plants upstream of Eunice and in the Monument area will compete for space with San Juan and Anadarko gas moving south from Plains Station. 
NOVA said it must reduce target linepack due to increasing soil and ambient temperatures and to maintenance outages. It is seeking index-based unconditional tenders through Tuesday for the firm sale of about 200,000 gigajoules. Tenders may be submitted for all or some of the reduction, which will be accomplished through inventory transfers. The gas must be taken in more or less even increments over a period of up to five days starting on or about June 28, 2001. Call Darryn Rouillard at (403) 920-6341 for more information. 
ANR plans to begin maintenance Monday at its Havensville Compressor Station that will run through Oct. 15 and reduce Southwest Mainline capacity by about 125 MMcf/d. However, based on current flow levels the impact of the work should be minimal, ANR said. 
Due to unexpected difficulties in operating the Bisti Station's #8 unit while the C-1 turbine at the Chaco Plant in northwestern New Mexico is out of service, flow from all wells in the GBISTI gathering system should remain shut in until turbine maintenance is complete, El Paso Field Services said. The C-1 turbine is expected to return to service June 29. Operators must contact Troy Chamberlain at (505) 564-4015, Corina Veloz at (505) 599-2357 or the Control Center at (505) 599-2334 before turning wells back on. 
El Paso said Wednesday evening its Guadalupe Station turbine and the #3 turbine at Pecos River Station #3 turbine had tripped offline unexpectedly. The Guadalupe unit was returned to service quickly that evening, but attempts to restart the Pecos River unit have been unsuccessful. Capacity through Pecos River is limited to 840 MMcf/d until further notice. 
NGPL reported discovery of a gas quality problem at the Transok-Bryan receipt point in Bryan County, OK. NGPL is working with Transok to resolve the problem but said if it continues, NGPL may need to cut scheduled volumes at the point.

Subject:	System enhancements

Maggie,

I would like to submit the following suggestions for enhancements to the TMS system.  

  	a.  For printing Source Path and Allocation Path reports during the Allocation Process, the print function 		     should be set at permanent default of legal and landscape.  This would be a real time saver when 		    checking the allocated points for uncalled for cuts.

	b.  Customers would like to have subtotals by point and a grand total  on the storage daily activity report 		     (IDD/PNR Contract Balance).  We now have the grouping to sum function, but I think this is too  time 	     consuming for our customers.

	c.  In the Scheduled Quantities listings, instead of the box which now says ""No cuts were found in this 		     cycle.  Do you want to continue checking?""  I think the notice for Final AM should be expanded to say 	    ""Did you submit new nominations for the Final AM Cycle?  If not, please view Intraday 2 for any 		     possible cuts.""  Since so few of our customers actually use the Final AM Cycle, I think this would be 		     helpful to our customers who are frequently under severe time restraints and stress when trying to 		     figure out what went wrong. 
 
	d.  I would like a serious investigation into the time required to do manual scheduling.  The slowness of 		     the system for this procedure is tortuous.   It is also a  serious time waster.

Please advise if you need further information.

Janet McDaniel

"SoCal Needles ""Window"" allocation","	
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.

Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late ""preliminary"" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

Lynn, how would we handle this Accounting wise? Since it went through our meter, the customer is going to get credit for this gas and transportation, which he should not.

Subject:	Warren Eunice

It was brought to my attention this last weekend that when Warren Eunice goes sour and our valve shuts, there is a blow off valve down stream of our measurement that Warren  personnel are using to vent the sour gas until it turns sweet. So, while they are venting the gas we still show flow of 8,000 to 10,000 which is measured as if we received the gas. I have notified Bob Bandel and he is looking into the situation. They were not aware that this was happening. Richard brought this to my attention.

"TW Weekly Meeting","
	Shelley, we had our weekly TW imbalance meeting this morning and I think
	you will be very pleased next week to see the progress the team has made.
	
	They have come up with plans for both the dollar valued and volumetric
	imbalances.  We have ensured the volumetric imbalances have not grown
	this last week and will continue this effort.   

	TK, Darrell and Dan are bringing suggestions to the table to look at the economics
	of what the customers are doing.   We will continue to monitor throughout
	this week and weekend and be ready for an update on Tuesday.

	Hope you both are having a great vacation.  See ya next week.  Lynn

Subject:	Notes from 637 Imbal Mtg 9/18/01


Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to minimize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for ""auto-balancing"".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could ""Trade""

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

Subject:	RE: Pipeline Interconnect Forum Information

Lynn,
I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that you
could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background and
the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do you
think?

   Lynn,
   We lost our discussion leader for the ""mismatches during ID2"" topic.
   Are
   you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
   important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
   everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but all
   of
   the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.
   Thank you,

      Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
   meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
      ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
   Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
      group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
   Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
      email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with
   Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
      Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
   cancellation.

      One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
   ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
      pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
   the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
      if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these
   mismatches.  If you would like
      to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.

      Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
   Thanks. Lynn

"Carlton Resolution","	
	We finally found the right person in the KN Energy organization for the 18 dth Carlton Obligation.

	KN will nominate today for Gas Day 26th going forward.  We told KN that they will have a penalty
	of $25.00 per dth for each day they did not nominate.  18 dth x 25.00 = $450/day x 3 days = $1350.

	We also told them we have been leaving messages since Saturday.  We left messages at 
	3 different offices.  KN admitted to seeing the posting but ""did not understand"" the obligation
	and they did not call for clarification.

	If you have any questions, please let John (Ext. 7429) or I (Ext. 7637) know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Infrastructure Prevents...


All,

Recent events have had us reporting virus outbreaks and outages which have impacted business and communications.  With these incidents, we have had several meetings to discuss communications in times of crisis to ensure consistent, validated content and appropriate mediums to use for that content.  All to ensure everyone impacted is notified timely with accurate status.

Since Friday (09/21), there have been three (3) incidents that have confronted our environment which did not impact our business due to our fault tolerance, pro-active measures and relationship with Enron Networks.  All of these incidents could have had a serious impact to our business, so I thought it important to communicate these incidents and how they were handled which prevented any business impact.

09/24 - 25:  W32.Vote.A@mm virus
Working with Enron Networks, we were able to patch all servers and workstations in ETS Houston and Omaha, ETS Field Operations, Azurix and EOTT.  Below is a URL which conveys the damage potential this virus has which we avoided.  Teams had to work through the night, but the end result was no business impact.

http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.vote.a@mm.html

09/22:  Power hit at Ardmore Data Center Facility

During the morning of Saturday, lighting struck near the Ardmore data center facility knocking out all power.  The battery backup systems assumed the system load while the generators came on-line.  The Ardmore facility ran on generators through the day until power was re-established with Reliant.  ETS' production SAN and the majority of our production database servers reside at Ardmore.  No systems were affected.

09/21 SAN Drive Errors

On Friday morning, one of the production drives on our Hitachi SAN reported drive errors.  The SAN phoned home for support, a support technician was dispatched and the drive reporting errors was replaced within 1 hour, 20 minutes.  Upon the detection of drive errors, the SAN engaged an on-line hot spare as a replacement which assumed the function of the drive with errors.  The drive was replaced, data replicated back over, and we were back live in our original configuration.  It is important to note that new devices have an infant mortality rate for initial errors detected after shipping.  This rate usually occurs within 60 days of production go-live.  Impact to the business:  None.

These are 3 examples where our infrastructure withstood incidents.  I believe this communication is just as important as the communication we all desire in times of crisis.

Thanks,
-Scott.

Attatched is our rework of Charlies ""Check Valve"" reimbursement proposal.
As you can see, we have expanded the scope of this potential agreement to
address several issues and put in place a mechanism to continue to make
progress towards the best gas segregation fix we can come up with in the
Holcomb area.  Please get us your comments and revisions as soon as
possible.  Let me know if you have questions.

Subject:	TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Offer

All:  

As part of the TW Negotiated Rate Settlement Hearing, it has been suggested that the following modification to CAS and other associated systems be made:

EBB sytem that allows a shipper interested in capacity to simply enter a receipt and delivery point; the system will automatically let the interested shipper know how much, if any, capacity is available (advantage: although it doesn't provide the IS's the ""last look"" auction their looking for, it at least provides an open process for anybody that is interested to find out if capacity is available (eliminates any claim of ""tortious process""); disadvantage: feasibility and cost are unknown at this time).

This was drafted by an attorney without considerable consultation with Gas Logistics.  

A settlement offer that includes minor tariff changes will be provided to the parties in the proceeding this week.  Although this will buy some time, a scope and cost estimate needs to be determined so that if the modification above is offered, we know what the cost is.    

Alma:  Please schedule a 1 hour meeting with anyone on the distribution and if anyone else should be included, please let Alma know.  

Brad

Subject:	Wire Transfer Processing

Treasury, SAP, and GCP have been working together for a number of months to resolve payment issues.  During this time, Treasury has been reviewing each wire transfer manually.  It is now time to move to the next step and allow our banking system to provide these edits and focus our attention on just the wires that fail the edits.

Treasury has partnered with GCP and SAP to quickly resolve any vendor master and data entry related issues.  This team will be working with business units as needed to expedite the correction and reprocessing of payments to meet the commercial needs of Enron.  We will need your cooperation to expedite the turn around on any items in your area.

More detailed resolution procedures will be developed next week and communicated to all of you.  

Thank you for your help in this process.

Subject:	OneOk

Dave heard back from Terry Spencer of OneOk today that OneOk has changed its position on a couple of key issues.  First, Terry indicated that OneOk now agrees that the arbitration award is not limited in effect to just the past period.  They agree that the award interprets the measurement agreement, and that the interpretation is not limited to just the retroactive effect.  It is not clear how broad they think the prospective effect of the award is, but any change is significant on this issue.  Second, Terry indicated that OneOk is very likely to ask for a special test of the meters as a way of resolving the April-May issue, and, implicitly, the issue of whether the meters are OK going forward. This is also a big change, as OneOk has refused to call a special test since the initial demand letter we sent them last Fall.  

Spencer indicated OneOk was drafting a letter that would clarify their position.  In light of that, and of the apparent progress Dave made, Stan has agreed we should hold off on the demand letter until we see their letter.  Once Dave gets it, we'll all take a look and decide the next step.  Thanks.  DF

Could, at least a few of us, get zip drives installed so that we can have backup for our large files.  Floppy disks are not large enough for some files. My Lamar Power file will not fit on a floppy.

Subject:	Re: Western Gas Resources   

The shippers behind Gomez have been going to WGR since Jan. 1, 2001 and the shippers at Mitchell CO2 have been aware of the pending sell of NNG assets to WGR since at least Jan. 1, 2001.  All of this gas is going to WGR and none of it returns to NNG.  So this was communicated last year when all this was being planned.

The OBA was not affected with this sell.  The OBA with WGR is one OBA that totalled all points.  They owe us 107,000 dth at the end of last month and we owe them 36,000 dth for fuel usage on the #5 unit at Gomez for the first five months of the year.  All that will be left on WGR's OBA will be Benedum and Midkiff.  Dan Ball and I are working together and hope to have the OBA near zero by the end of July.

I hope this answers your questions, if not let me know.

Randy

Lynn,

Trading gas for the first day of month is already a hectic if not absolutely crazy day.  Putting out the final posting of the fuel rates the day of trading is not acceptable.  Northern has one of the most complicated fuel matrices in the industry and expecting your customers to change those matrices the day of trading puts us in a very tough situation.  It will difficult at best to get you our nominations in a timely manner due to your decision.   Next time you decide to change fuel rates at least give us one day to implement the changes not two hours.

		Previous Cyclce Nomination	Current Nomination	Confirmation	Schedule

	Confirmation piece is not critical if that prolongs getting the report.

	The reason for the report  - Gas Control needs to know what changes have taken place and

	If we already have access to something similar to this, let me know.  I would like to be

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

NGTS indicated that Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company wanted to buy back 100 Dths of this gas at POI 78163 and the system would not allow it.  I pulled up POI 78163 only to discover that it was not a legitimate POI on NNG and that POI 401 was a receipt POI only.  I then went to Gary Spraggins to verify if their was a POI that NGTS could delivery gas off NNG for Pioneer's compressor.

Received a call from Tim Green and Cindy White at Pioneer Gas Pipeline Company (915) 655-3300 explaining Pioneer sent in an agreement form to create a new interconnect to take gas off NNG and mailed NNG a check to cover this expense.   I t went to Linda Trevino to see where we stood with this new agreement.  Linda indicated that she had not activated POI 78163 as she did not have a reference contract.  I called Pioneer and they indicated that NGTS would be the only supplier at this POI.  I called Darren Brown at NGTS and he informed me that he would be using contract 107903 to deliver gas to Pioneer's compressor starting 6/1/01.  I gave the contract information to Linda and she activated the POI and it defaulted to active confirmation.  I called Tim at Pioneer and asked him if ""active confirmation"" was what he really needed and he indicated that he would prefer ""confirmation by exception"".  I had him fill out ""NNG Request for Operator Choice Form"" and fax to me.  Linda  changed the operator option for Pioneer to reflect ""confirmation by exception"".  

Tim Green asked if they could set up an OBA at POI 78163 as the compressor would not necessarily use the 100 Dths nomed daily?  I had him send an e:mail request to Zula Carter and myself indicating POI 78163 be added to the OBA at POI 401 Gains County #2.   This e:mail request must be approved and Zula Carter will advise us when this takes place.

I got involved in this as I schedule for NGTS although I realize POI 401 is on the So TX Team and assigned to Janet.

If I you have any questions feel free to call me.

Nancy

Subject:	JDF Walk for a Cure!



    
Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.  

I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a ""JDF Shoe"" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf? on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!

Lisa Sawyer

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Drip

Debbie Moseley called me a few weeks ago about the Mt. Jesus drip.  Oneok is not giving NNG Btu replacement for the hydrocarbon liquid being hauled from the Mt. Jesus location.  The imbalance is approaching $60,000, and Oneok seems unwilling to change their position.  Oneok claims that the hauler is not paying them for liquid, but is writing water on the ticket.  I sampled the liquid and sent Oneok (John Hanna) a copy of the analysis, showing the liquid as drip, not water.  In the past, I know that we did not push Oneok on this issue because of the Bushton measurement dispute.  Now that the Bushton measurement dispute is near settlement, should this Mt. Jesus issue be addressed?  There are at least two other Oneok liquid issues that need to be addressed:  1.  Oneok is receiving payment at Hemphill #3 for liquid, and this gas does not go to Bushton (Sammy Williams may have more detail on this issue).
2.  Sublette liquid is condensate, and it is being called water on the ticket.
Do you have any ideas on how to proceed?  We do not seem to be able to get the issue resolved at this level.  Thanks.

Subject:	Concerns 

Lynn,

I wanted to express my concerns of having Raetta and I located on another floor, away from the NNG teams.  Raetta and I deal with the MS Reps daily on the following items:

*Approving all Journal Vouchers and Wire transfer requests
*Questions from all NNG reps concerning rates on invoices, volume allocations, imbalances, accounts receivables, etc.
*Sitting in on conference calls with the reps and customers (or marketers) concerning invoices, imbalances, accounts receivable, etc
*Meeting with you every morning and through the day on various customer issues and questions


During the Reservation close cycle (approximately 6 work days), Raetta and I need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting
*Distribution of the South Region Flash report (Craig Buehler's report) and reviewing it

During the Commodity PPA close cycle (approximately 5 work days), we would need to be on same floor with the reps for:

*Reviewing the preliminary transportation, penalty and imbalances invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS and GVA error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them

During the current month Commodity close cycle (approximately 4 work days), we would need to be on the same floor with the reps for:

Reviewing the preliminary invoices (before passing to reps) for unusual high or low dollar amounts
*Assigning new contracts or new customers to reps
*Answering questions from reps about the invoices or rates
*Reviewing TAS error reports for unbilled invoices or processing errors, and correcting them
*Reviewing the Flash report and attending the Flash meeting

The total number of days I have just listed are 15 work days. The maximum number of work days a month totals at 22.  Therefore, approximately 3 weeks out of the month, Raetta and I would have to be on the floor daily.  In this totals, I am NOT including the 3 work days it takes me to meet with reps on NNG OBA imbalances to gather and analyze information for the Customer Accounts meeting.

As you can see, it is very important for Raetta and myself to remain on the floor with the MS reps.  See me if you need further details.

Larry

"RE: Morning storage numbers","	Kent and Dave, I reviewed our analysis of the swing for July 17th this morning in the meeting.  High level
	recap is:


		130,000		Due to building line pack from Monday's gas day
		 95,000		Day to Day payback and I/C shortages ( the bulk of this was to
					repay Norval and Valero Sprayberry about 60,000 from
					the previous day)

		140,000		Due to Market Area overtake (this includes 40,000 of Mid Am imbalance
					plus 100,000 spread over ABC, D and EF.  In looking at LSF, we
					were not able to determine that any one zone over pulled.  It looked
					to be pretty evenly distributed)

		 15,000		Due to 5% tolerance on Power packs.
		_______
		380,000		The total swing was 419,000.  The difference of 39,000 is a combination
					operational adjustments.

	Hopefully this helps to identify some of your concerns.  If you have any questions, please let me
	know.  Thanks. Lynn

THanks Terry,

We still need to look into what the source of the huge daily unanticipated swing numbers for the past 3 days.  Is this related to some of our scheduling difficulties with BP Amoco into El Paso or is it spread across our LDC shippers in the Market Area?

Subject:	Morning storage numbers

The storage numbers on the 8 am morning report were the correct numbers but the numbers being referenced to on (Sum Sheet Report) this morning had an error causing the unanticipated swing number be much larger than anticipated. It has been corrected and is now within 2 thousand of the 8 am report. The unanticipated swing number for the two previous days still stands as shown on the sum sheet report. If you have any further questions, feel free to give me a call at, 3-6403. Thank you.

Penny and Lynn,
I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.

Brad,

This is what I would like to convey to the users at this time.  Also, let everyone know that I am available to attend their individual staff meetings.


The Business Objects IT staff is currently in the process of upgrading the hardware and software for Business Objects.  The hardware will provide better processing times and more stability.  The software upgrade will provide some bug fixes and enhancements.

As far as the effect to the users, the impact should be minimal.  

If the users accesses Business Objects through InfoSource.ETS.Enron.com, there will be no changes.
If the users accesses BO through ZABO, they will need the new version installed.  This will accomplished through a Corp script that will either push the new software onto the users PC or they will have to select a Start menu item.

The go live date is Dec 1.

Lori Saffer will be sending reminder e-mails as the deadline approaches.  

Thank you for all your help,
Lori Saffer

In conjunction with getting formal approval for the Rates & Revenue system, we are soliciting ""buy-in"" from the Marketing group.  It is important for them to understand the project plan, the initial functionality and the level of Marketing personnel commitment for use case writing and testing.  Shelley requested that this topic be discussed along with  the following:  

Morning meeting structure and content
Deal Capture
Web Site posting procedures

The marketing attendees would be Jo Williams, Kent Miller, Bill Fowler and Dave Nuebauer.  As soon as Shelley discusses this with Dave, I will move forward to set up the meeting (in Omaha).     We will need to meet prior to the meeting to discuss structure, content and attendees.

Have a phone number or contact at Warrior?  

Also, we will need to talk about what has transpired between the 3rd and now.  Jean told me yesterday that even though there is no nom we are scheduling and delivering gas to this POI under a dead contract (ENA's).   We should not be doing this.  This will cause DDVC penalties et al.  Until we have a contract for transport with someone - we shouldn't just flow gas.

John,  After we spoke this afternoon I had another call from John Wollaston @ Embassy Natural Gas.  He spoke with Warrior Gas, a Clayton Williams company, which is the gas supplier and they are willing to assume the responsibility for the transport at POI 4879.  Let me know how to proceed, if this is a viable option. Do we want to set up a contract with Warrior Gas?  Do we want to establish and OBA for this point with Embassy - Mr. Wollaston mentioned the OBA possibility.  The deal with Sid Richardson is probably not going to happen.

I couldn't find a contract for Warrior or Clayton Williams on NNG.

Let's talk tomorrow.

Subject:	Potential Customer

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.  

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean
3-7757

Dave Neubauer received a voice mail message today from Terry Spencer in which Terry stated that ONEOK will be forwarding the withheld mmbtu reimbursement payments for the condensate removed from Northern's Mt. Jesus drip.  Dan, please notify the rest of us when payment is received.

As an aside, note that last week CP Energy and Touchstone Trucking met with our Ron Brickman and others after identifying themselves as, a new condensate marketer and drip hauler retained by ONEOK to begin collecting the Mt. Jesus, Fowler, Sublette locations.  It is our understanding that these folks were brought in by Oneok on a trial basis to collect drip at locations that have been a ""problem"" for/between Oneok and its current hauler.

Subject:	RE: US Energy/LS Power storage allocation issue

I want to clarify the problem. In researching the problem I found that the rate retrieved for PnR was slightly higher than the rate retrieved for FDD Overrun. In our discussions with Bill Anderson, we focused  on how this impacted the contract he asked us to review. Bottom line is in storage allocations, the LSP -Whitewater overrun activity should have received a greater portion of the available injection capacity.
The IT group is correcting the problem. The 7.61 cent PnR rate will be hard coded in the allocation program this afternoon as interim fix until the proper system modifications are ready.

Subject:	US Energy/LS Power storage allocation issue
Importance:	High

Hello,

Mike Bodnar and I called Bill Anderson at US Energy today regarding his complaints about the storage allocation process.  Bill has claimed that LS Power is being allocated down to zero on days when he should be receiving a pro-rata share of the overrun injections on any given day throughout the summer.  

Mike found out that LS Power - Whitewater was being incorrectly allocated down to zero on certain days throughout the summer due to the system pointing to an incorrect (discounted) overrun rate for the storage account of LS Power - Whitewater.  LS Power was being charged the full, non-discounted overrun rate on their FDD contract.  

US Energy will undoubtedly want to negotiate a settlement of some sort, since they believe this has been an issue since 6/1/01.   

I believe we need to do the following:

1 - Determine if the other LS Power plant (Cottage Grove) was also affected by this system error.
2 - Determine the date that the incorrect rate took affect.
3 - Determine how LS Power overrun injections throughout this summer were affected by this, since 6/1/01.
4 - Determine a fair and equitable solution to this issue (as of 6/1/01) to present to the customer within three weeks.

I will set up a video meeting as soon as possible with regards to this issue.

Tim Johanson

Shelly, Just wanted to update you on a few things.

1.  Steve and I have been asked to work with McGown and Steve Kirk on the SLA settlement.  There is a meeting in Omaha we are attending on Wed. With Mary Kay and Dave.

2.  There is a marketing issue in relation to NNG procedures on monitoring stranger's gas.  There is a meeting Thursday morning with Dave and Mary Kay. After that mtg Dari, Mary and I are going to review procedures for any changes. 

3.  I will conference in for Thursday's Customer Service mtg.
I hate not being there but I think these other meetings are big enough to have presence in Omaha

4.  The SoCal meeting was very beneficial. Only one possible variance from what we had previously heard.  There is a possibility SoCal could reduce capacity at ID2.  Pat and I talked abot TW concerns.  I will review with marketing and the team when I get back.

I love my Blackberry, but still getting used to typing on it.  Anxious to hear how the paging worked for you.

Hope your trip to Florida was good.  Also hope you can Make since of This email.

Subject:	Transwestern Invoicing

I have attached a spreadsheet that Elizabeth put together for us for our February invoicing so you can get an idea of the categories and the number of invoices.

These are the 7 categories Elizabeth checks, and how they can be redistributed:

Void Invoices: There are only two of these invoices each month, MSR's can check these, but Marketing will have to communicate when there are additional Invoices that need to be voided.
Delete Line Items: This can also be checked by MSR's but new contracts with these exceptions need to be explained by Marketing to the corresponding MSR for that customer
Volume Adjust: These are also only for exceptional contracts, MSR's can check these exceptions, but Marketing will have to explain exceptions on New Contracts to the corresponding MSR for that customer.
Make-up Volume: MSR's
Adjust Reservation Invoices for change in Credit for Commodity due to make-up: MSR's
Adjust Rate: Marketing
Regenerate Invoice: MSR's

 

We will start checking these for May Accounting,
The TW Team

Subject:	Small Volume Delivery Points in the Field

I would like at host a meeting to discuss new small volume delivery points in the field.  The Business Development group has at least three requests from different entities for new delivery points.  The issues to be discussed at the meeting include type of measurement to be installed at the point, applicability of DDVCs. balancing, OBAs and a host of other issues.  These small volume points take an extraordinary amount of time for many departments and produce a very small amount of revenue for ETS.  Anything that can be done to simplify the process would be a cost benefit to ETS.  

The meeting details are as follows:


	Day			Wednesday
	Date			October 10, 2001
	Time 			3:00 P.M.
	Location		Houston EB 42C2   (relocation of the video conference facilities)

Good letter.  One suggestion--our insistence that the meters and the chromatograph ""were reliably and accurately . . ."" doing their respective things sounds kind of defensive.  In fact, we don't know what they were doing because we have no record of the data they sent to the ROC, right?  Would it be less adversarial to simply say ""the ultrasonic meters . . .continued to operate normally. . ."" and to say the same for the chromatograph?  We do know that the meters and chromatograph did continue to operate because they had not shut down, right?  Also, I'd like to better understand the formula we're using to alibi the data.  What are ""the time periods of normal operation""?  Was that ratio developed from our data from Sep. 1-12?  IF so, why does the formula create such a significant increase in the variance?  Thanks. df

Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc


Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an ""an"" in the first sentence, right before the word ""incident""; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

Subject:	Northern v. ONEOK/Fisher Roc Outage Letter


	Drew,

	Grant is putting the finishing touches on the proposed letter to ONEOK explaining the Fisher Roc lock up period of September 12-16 and what we will do to resolve it.  Long and short, we are declaring that this is an ""error in the Inlet/Outlet meter formula"", rather than a ""Btu measurement error,"" because there was nothing wrong with Northern's chromatograph that caused this problem.  Accordingly, we will not be using the Plant's PTR during the outage period, but rather a formula based on the ratio between the rich inlet and rich outlet volumes for a period of time before and after the outage period, as per 2b.(iv) of the Measurement Agreement.

	I will circulate a draft of the letter to all by e-mail once I get it from Grant.  It is prepared for signature by Ken Cessac.

	Questions:
	
	1.  Who with ETS needs to be on the copy list on this and any future letters regarding measurement errors at Bushton?

	2.  Who at ONEOK (maybe more than one person?) should receive this letter?

	Many thanks for your input.

	Britt

		In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts.

In conjunction with getting formal approval for the Rates & Revenue system, we are soliciting ""buy-in"" from the Marketing group.  It is important for them to understand the project plan, the initial functionality and the level of Marketing personnel commitment for use case writing and testing.  Shelley requested that this topic be discussed along with  the following:  

Morning meeting structure and content
Deal Capture
Web Site posting procedures

The marketing attendees would be Jo Williams, Kent Miller, Bill Fowler and Dave Nuebauer.  As soon as Shelley discusses this with Dave, I will move forward to set up the meeting (in Omaha).     We will need to meet prior to the meeting to discuss structure, content and attendees.

When the descrepancy between our rates posted on the website and entered in our system was discovered, did we notify any of our customers that this had occurred.  ENA loads our rates into their system.  They should probably know if they need to re-load them for September 1.

What do you think?

	After talking with Vernon, I told her that we would draft an OBA on Wednesday with Month

	we would continue the same methodology as we have today, which is Oneok picks one of the

	Karen, per our conversation, please draft an OBA to send to Oneok.

Each month I receive run statements from third party vendors showing volumes
of condensate purchased during the month, I also receive field tickets to
match up to the statements.  In regards to the Mt. Jesus location, we do not
receive such documentation.  We have no way to distinguish if any volumes
were purchased from Mt. Jesus since we do not receive statements, nor
tickets.  Our trader, Jon Hanna received a spreadsheet showing volumes NNG
believes we owe for the Mt. Jesus location.  Can you send me the
documentation NNG is using to come up with these volumes.

 Kermit Turbine station and KB-line outage has been scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 11th. We are planning for a 24 hour outage and it will be posted as a 24 hour shut-in, but if everything goes as planned operations could possibly be ready to go back in-service after 12 to 14 hours. The 30"" KB-line mainline block valve 7 miles north of Kermit will be shut and line blown down. This will not affect the El Paso Keystone interconnect.  Based on current flows in the Kermit to Gomez subsystem  it would affect about 375,000 MMBTU.in deliveries and 25,000 mmbtu in receipts ( Sid Richardson)

The following points will be shut-in during this time:

          POI.
  62873 - Sid Richardson rec.
  60749- TW Halley del.
  36175- Valero Ward del.
  152 -Westar Reeves del.

Joe,

As discussed, please repath January 2001 for contract 101559.  I have input the rates on the invoice that Jeff Nielsen said he agreed to.  However, there are certain paths for the same period of time that Oneok indicated different rates for each.  They should be consistent so I input one rate for all paths on a Mid to Mid basis.  Therefore, after you repath the invoice, we will still have a difference.  I want to write-off whatever balance still exists after repathing.  Please prepare the write-off documentation and I will sign.  We need to be sure to do this before we go into next year.  Also, this is the only invoice you have provided me that had issues on this contract which I find hard to believe.   Can you double-check to see that there are no other A/R issues for this IT contract and let me know ASAP.

Thanks!
Vernon

Subject:	Follow-up Questions for Shipper

I attended a meeting with a Shipper yesterday who had questions that I promised to answer when I returned to the office.  Three of them are questions for you.

1) 	In order to use the 8:00 AM cycle for true-ups, since you cannot have a new path on the 8:00 AM, is it possible to put in a zero nom path to use for adjustments 	in the 8:00 AM? Yes
2)	What is considered a new nom when looking at non-on-time noms?  For instance, if you have a nom on the on-time and change the ID of upstream/downstream 	shippers on the 6:00PM, is this considered a new nom which jeopardizes flowing gas rights - especially if it was alternate firm? (what exactly triggers the system to 	view a change to any info that was in place as a new nom)
	Key Fields trigger a new path.  John will get you the fields.
3)	Is there a way, by Contract, to not allow a nom to be put in place if it is outside the contract alternate points (they don't want to be hit with Max Rates if their 	scheduler noms from a point they shouldn't have)?  No, the alternate template is all reciept points and all delivery points    

Also, they were delighted to hear that you would be willing to possibly come to their office to give an in depth scheduling discussion and may take you up on it.  I'll let you know.  We will need to meet with you before you go (if you go - may not be necessary or requested).  Just let me know if they call you, I am sure I can find SOMEONE to go to Virginia.  

Thanks!

Subject:	Scheduled quantity reports

All,
some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.

At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.

Thanks

 Terry,

You raise an excellent point.  First, let me clarify that when the change to the point mdq was input on 4/25, it was made retroactive to 4/1.  The TMS revalidation caught the change and made the adjust on 4/25/01 because this is the day the change was made in CMS.   TMS doesn't currently have the functionally in place to retroactively change scheduled quantities because of a retro change made by the upstream system.  The question is why was this change allowed by the upstream system?  Is there any business reason why we are changing contract data retroactively?  Is the current policy working?    We should probably get Rick involved get some of these questions addressed.

Regards,

Tammy

The revaildation worked for 4/25, but does not do anything to the prior days in the scheduling system,  unless we manual schedule it accordingly. Do we have any flags in the contract or scheduling system to keep us from back dating a contract to the first of the month, if prior days have scheduled volumes greater than the change made to that contract? In this case their were 13 days of 5,000 scheduled above the contract MDQ, which should be scheduled as overrun and billed at that rate.

If you look at the Scheduled Quantity by Cycle Screen you can tell that the volume was lowered on the ID1 volume for 4/25 with a CQC reduction reason code (revalidation code).  They then changed their nom volume for the rest of the cycles.

If you have any questions, feel free to call me.

"VPEM Questions","	
	Vernon, Gerry, Raetta and Steve, here are the questions and answer as I recall from the conference call
	today.  Please let me know of any changes or corrections and I will make them then send to Virginia Power.



	Greg, here are the questions and answers that we promised you from the conference call on Tuesday,
	November 6.  Please review and let Vernon or I know if you need any clarification.

	1.  What fields can be changed on a nomination and the nomination still keep its flowing gas rights from the previous cycle?

		Answer - (1) QUANTITY volume equal to scheduled amount or volume lower than scheduled amount
			  (2) RANK changed to a different number

	2.  Where can I find information on Imbalance Tiering in relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

		Answer - Tariff Sheet 267.D & E (Raetta, so you agree?)

	3.  What points are in the grouping to determine a demarc allocation?

		Answer - Beatrice (Trailblazer) and demarc are the only two points in the group

	4.  If Virgina Power is transporting gas to demarc and demarc is allocated, can Virginia Power
	     switch their nomination to demarc deferred delivery and keep their gas flowing?

		Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery IS included in a demarc allocation
			  because the transport tied to this storage nomination is physically coming from
		              the field to the market area. (Greg we may not have been clear on this comment
			  on the conference call)

Subject:	OneOk Talking Points

Below are the talking points that I'd propose we run by Stan and then have Stan use with John Gibson and Dave use with Terry Spencer.  Once everyone is OK with these, I'll email to Stan and Dave with a brief explanation that our recommendation is that we politely decline the suggestion from Steve Winston that we voluntarily rewrite the measurement agreement.  

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a ""BTU measurement error"".

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a ""special test"" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

Subject:	Market Area Allocations


	I received a question this morning from FGU regarding a cut they got on contract 5141 for ID-2.  The total volume nominated on the

	contract did not change from ID-1 to ID-2, however, they did move around some volumes on their delivery points - (decreased some

	primary delivery points and increased alternate-firm delv. points).  When we did the Market Area allocation for ID-2, it looked at

	the ""alternate point"" increase as ""incremental"" - even though total contract volume remained the same.  I was somewhat confused by

	this cut  and talked with Joe Hoang.

	According to Joe:  PLEASE NOTE that the Market Area Flowing rights for a contract are retained by:

	1)   Contract
	2)   Gas Type
	3)   Nominator - Duns

	
	Therefore, if a shipper  has a total of 30,000 mmbtu's of flowing gas rights on a contract:  10,000 Alternate firm and 20,000
	of Primary firm and they change their nom - reducing the Primary firm volume to 15,000 and increase the Alternate firm
	volume to 15,000 - the additional 5,000 of Alternate firm would be considered ""incremental"".

	FYI

Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Larry

Subject:	RE: TMS Outage post Production Migration


Beginning Wednesday, after the production migration, a problem was discovered with the IDD/PNR Contract Balance view on the storage menu.  The view was not displaying all information; it appeared many of the total balance fields were missing and zeros were displayed where numbers should have been.  After looking into the issue, we discovered that the data was never making it from the database.  This led us to believe there was a driver incompatibility issue.

We began working with Microsoft to find the cause of the problem.  Meanwhile, we removed our ODBC changes for this particular image and went back to using native driver connections.  This solved the problem with the view so it was decided to move this change to production.  We are still working with Microsoft to find the exact cause of the problem.

A fix was developed yesterday and moved into production last night.  The view should be fixed today.  I have tested it and am happy with the results.

We are satisfied with the solution of switching this process back to native driver connections.  I can give a more detailed explanation if you like, just let me know.

"RE: End-user Agreement Processes","	I would like to recap my understanding and the ""To Do's"" from the meeting yesterday.  

		1.  After November 1, Measurement would NO longer adjust any TBS physical
	                 volumes unless there was a PPA directly influencing said TBS.

		2.  Measurement would check  to see if they had a deduct meter they were
	                 using in the end user process. (Since the meeting we have discovered that
	 	     the deduct meter IS in GVA, therefore no checking needs to be done).

		3.  Gas Logistics would check with IT on possible enhancement (if necessary) for
		     negative volumes to the TBS.  (We have talked with IT and this would be
		     a major enhancement and have to be done with the new system).

		4.  Procedures need to be documented to handle negative numbers created by
		     the LDC giving measurement an end user actual volume greater than the 
		     TBS connected to NNG.

		5.  Measurement and Gas Logistics agreed that all measured volumes including
		     End User point volumes would be ""housed' in PGAS.

	After further discussions in Gas Logistics, our recommendation is that neither Measurement or Gas Logistics accomodate a
	negative number.  If the LDC gives measurement an end user volume greater than the TBS the following should happen:

		1.  Measurement should either:

			a.  Call the LDC and let them know they cannot accept a volume at an end
			     user point higher than their TBS.

			b.  Or Measurement can call Jodie Floyd on the Gas Logistics Measurement Desk
			     and Jodie will call LDC with the same info.

		2.  If Measurement does not get an answer before measurement close, then measurement will
		     use the number equal to the TBS for the end user point.

	Gary and Ellis, you may want to have more discussions on this topic.  I would be glad to regroup if you want.
	I have put a call into Marketing to talk to them about our concerns on this issue.  Also Raetta and Jodie are
	 going to go ahead and call Wisconsin Gas and get their explanation of why an end user point would be
	greater than the TBS.  Hopefully it is just a measurement error.  We will let you know the outcome.

	If there is something I missed, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	MOPS Operating Contract

Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams regarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item has come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we enter into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service for the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closing to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into their back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulletin Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and downstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams entity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we would be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't anticipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them.  

Thanks for your help.

Bob

Please let me know if you have an interest and when you might be available and  I?ll arrange for the conference room to be available.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Lynn, I have been trying for several months now to get Onoek to reimburse Northern for a credit they have taken twice (5/00 and 6/00 Commodity billing).

Northern wired Oneok $178,748.87 on 8/10/00 after netting 6/00 commodity items.  On 2/12/01 Oneok came back an took a credit for the same items.  Two items were short paid which now leaves Oneok owing Northern $182,006.19.

Nothern also wired Oneok $26,847.80 on 6/29/00 after netting a transport imbalance with other outstanding items.  Oneok has taken this credit twice as well.

I have tried on numerous occasion to get Oneok to reimburse Northern but, Oneok continues to tell me they are researching the problem and can't seem to locate the wires.  When I spoke with Oneok early on they found the larger wire which was posted as Enron instead of Northern.  Again today they are telling me they can not locate the payment.  The reason for this memo is to get you assist me in getting these items cleared.  I have been working with Richard Tibbs (accounting) and Kelly Olsteen (payment), Richard reports to Randy McIntosh.  I really appreciate your assistance.

I have good news, finally!  The Cardiologist says everything with Linda's heart is within normal limits.  There are some criteria that are close to being out of the normal range, so he is going to run some other tests to create a baseline and is going to monitor her annually.  The Cardiologist concurred with her primary care doctor that the anemia, along with the post-surgerical complications she experienced probably caused the heart palputations.

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

Now would be a good time to remove any items from the refrigerators on 41.  There are only about 10 people left on 41 and there's still enough food and/or containers left here to feed a small country.  When everyone moves next week anything left in the refrigerator is history!

Subject:	New Morning Meeting Report

Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the
morning meeting:

	The report is completed for all information except:

		Storage
		Operational Capacity
		Current and Accum Imbalances

The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information 
available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced
fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this
group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not
giving up on possibilities.

As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report
and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will
change once the new report is completed.  

Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to
ensure we get the product we need.  

If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new
report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: From the Gas Logistics' weekly report:

Gary - for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NNG north or south end.    We will log the ticket as a ""Hot Seat"" entry.   He will need to give us a little description - meter number and the tech's name and location for the log entry purposes.  You can see that Mike wants to document and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customer's measurement and affect UAF & PPAs.   As we originally discussed,  this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk.

By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in GMS.  George does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems.   We don't want to duplicate efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to NNG & Market Services Management,  Measurement Specialist,  Measurement Operations, NNG Marketing,  Gas Control IT  &  NNG Field Operations. 

George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station, north or south.    If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech.   It would be good if George would give us updates on physical/software repairs.   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries & updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at 7 AM..   That is up to him.  He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries.   I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year.  Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues.  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work.

Tks - Mike W.

Mike,   our objective is to send the log out weekly.   Right now most of the activity in the log is being generated Enron internally by our proactive approach,  NNG Gas Control, NNG IT, Schedulers and Marketing folks.   Rick Dietz will be sending out an internal communication announcing the official formation of the NNG Measurement Desk within Gas Logistics later on this week.    An external message will follow.   Once the external customers are made formally aware of the desk and the number is published we will pick up a lot more activity on potential measurement issues.   I would like to send out the log weekly to Shelley, yourself, Rick Dietz, the Directors, Measurement Specialist, Field Operation Teams, GMS, NNG Gas Control IT,  and anyone else that should be in the loop.   I will be sending the log out for the first time this week.

We also believe that we will have much more problem identification with a network trouble tracking system is in place that is web based and interactive.    Once we have a better trouble tracking tool than our current Excel spreadsheet log we will be able to be much more proactive with the help we will receive from the IT ""Hot Seat"" and GMS.    The ""Hot Seat"",  within Gas Control,  will soon be a 24 hour function so they will be monitoring many of the EFM scanning functions & telemetry and in a position to give us a ""heads up"" of potential measurement issues that we will troubleshoot and track to resolution.  GMS will also be able to access the log and make entries that they believe are significant measurement issues. 

Mike, you can count on our continued commitment to work with your field operations personnel, Gas Control IT, Field Measurement Services, and GMS to minimize measurement issues and reduce UAF.

John, I would like to ask ENA to take this little volume to storage for the remainder of the month.  It looks stranger every day.  What do you think?

Updated 12/5 - ID2
Updated 12/6 - Evening

"SoCal - November 1 Changes","	Terry, please review and let me know if this sounds OK.  Thanks. Lynn


	We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day.  Today they only call an OFO before the gas day begins.
	     Starting Nov. 1, they can call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle,
	     including Intraday 1 and Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This
	     will be a major impact to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Thank you

Just got off the phone with Laura again.  She informed me that she had not deducted the GRI charges off Semco's invoices for April, May and June production.  I told her not to take the credits yet that Stacey was looking at the invoices.  

I think we need to look at this together.

Lynn,

Do you think it's possible for Robert to attend the Winter Ops Meeting in
KC this September?

I think it would be very valuable for both Shawn Amaya and Robert to spend
time together at the meeting just as I found it very valuable when I was
the Operations Rep for NNG a few years ago.  Not only is the Ops Meeting
structured and informative, it is also a great way to improve current ties
and create new relationships.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

I am planning to attend the NNG Winter Ops Meeting the second week of
September as we discussed.  However, my NNG rep Robert Benningfield informs
me that he and other reps might not be allowed to attend.  This was the
same case as last year.  Since I interact with my reps on a daily basis,
they are the ones familiar with our business and our operational concerns.
I think that it would be beneficial to us for him and other reps to attend
as they would be able to provide insight to the proceedings as they pertain
to our business.  We are investing time and money to attend these meetings
each year.  I think we should make sure that we get the most return out of
them.  Let me know if you can contact your counterpart at NNG to voice our
interest?

Thanks.

Shawn

Steve,

Our first thought on this was to make it a volumetric agreement.  But now, we are re-thinking that we would like to have a dollar-valued OBA with daily cash out.  Guardian wanted a copy of our agreement today, but since we plan to re-draft, I've told them that it will be a couple of weeks before they get a draft from us.  So, please disregard this and I'll be sending you a new OBA draft sometime within the next week or two.  Thanks!

Attached is the standard volumetric OBA agreement that NNG normally uses.  However, we have made some changes to it in paragraph #7 - Other provisions - in an attempt to tighten it up a bit.  Please let me know ASAP if you have any problems with the language.  Thanks!

have come up over the weekend.  The weekend crew is documenting the
questions.  I have left Mike Bodnar and John Buchanan a phone mail message
to research the questions and concerns on Monday.  Then we will group with
storage and determine what changes need to be made.

One change we talked about on the Sunday morning call with storage is to
be able to use SBS on the non allocated portion of storage.  ie, if we are
allocating injections, then withdrawals should still use SBS.  If we are allocating
withdrawals, then injections should still have access to SBS.  Mike Bodnar will
pursue this enhancement further.  Thanks. Lynn

FYI, with regards to item (3) below:
SBS will remain off after storage allocations are completed.  This will be a slight change for our customers.  Currently during the processes for example, the evening process, SBS is available during the Rollover, Allocation and Confirmation process, and turned off during the Storage Allocation process.  With this change SBS will only be available during the Rollover and Allocation process and remain off during the Storage Allocation and Confirmation process, if a storage allocation is necessary.  I am unsure how you would want to communicate this to your customers.  

Also, Jill will be working on these changes over the weekend, and have Joe confirm her change by Monday the 18th.  Changes should be available for production by Tuesday the 19th.

Jill,
Lynn and Steve January want to change the storage allocation from after confirmation to after regular allocations during all cycles except timely (for the timely cycle it storage allocations will be after confirmations).

I looked at the code and it seemed to be pretty self contained module.  But a few things to look out for:

1) Process for saving to the database
	- after allocations
	- after storage allocations
	- after confirmations
2) rollback of allocations to include storage
3) SBS - currently it turned off for the storage allocation process.  How does it get turned back on?  Business group has to make a decision on how whether SBS needs to turned on or off for the confirmation process

Please let maggie or gerry know the time estimate.

Thanx

Subject:	Cara out 11/14-15 info about PHPL

I will be out Thursday and Friday for oral surgery. I should be back on Monday assuming that everything goes well.  Wednesday I will be training at night with Jean. 

Panhandle has requested payback gas and Kay has approved it. Thursday and Friday Panhandle will receive 10,000 a day. Randy and I I nomed and confirmed the gas on our system for those two days. They want the payback to continue.  Scott has agreed to cover Panhandle and watch the payback.

Debra will cover any MOPS activity. 

Thank you,

Cara Vaughan

It appears that Citizens is continuing to overschedule volumes, thus the oba is still getting bigger.  Even though this oba will probably be cashed out, should we allow them to continue to ""overschedule""?
They have also been in a penalty situation the past few months.  When we do cash out, I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment.

Well, it's Mid October and I am checking on the status of the SBA Priority during Allocations.  The new contracts are due to take effect November 1, 2001, and with cold weather already on the horizon we could be headed for the same types of problems we had last  winter.

Steve,
Back in June we discussed the issue of the SBAs' priority during an Allocation.  The Business Development group and Contracts are in the process of making the necessary changes so that CMS can distinguish ITs associated with SBA activity from other IT agreements and are second through the meter after Primary during allocations.  For your information, below are the comments from the various people involved in this issue

Please let us know if you have any further concerns regarding this issue.  Thanks for your continued help in this matter.

I believe Reyna, et al, have held discussions with the Reg Types and received the green light to go forward, but I will confirm. 

Regarding (2.), With the new contract system being developed, the monitoring of contract provisions via the system should be do-able. I am sure both CMS and TMS will be involved in the effort.

Subject:	SBA Priority during Allocations

Sue, 
During the meeting today with Gerry to discuss the SBA priority during allocations, some of the following issues came up:  (Gerry, correct me if I misunderstood anything)

If we ever call an SBA to bring in gas after the timely cycle, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible? (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority during the timely cycle).
If the SBAs bring in gas at a secondary point, do we still want them to have priority over Alternate and Interruptible?  (my opinion is no, they should only have this priority at Primary Points).
Are we aware that an Alternate shipper who has flowing rights from the previous day might get ""squeezed"" out of the same entitlement on a day that an SBA shipper is given priority over Alternate?  Might have some mad shippers.
How will SBA volumes be posted on the EBB if there is an allocation: Interruptible???
Because the current methodology for allocation is based on a ""point"", they don't follow the downstream, will the IT contracts currently being used have to be identified through the contracts department as ""SBA IT""?
This is for the future contracts system:  Should we ask that the new contract system to automate all the manual processes of the SBAs such as account balance and carryover days in order for the system to be able to validate this criteria?

Subject:	OneOk Letter

I'd like to get the above group together to discuss our response to ONeOk's letter calling for a special test. The agreement requires us to ""cooperate"" with OneOk when a special test is called, and there are a number of issues we will need to cooperate on, including what to do for measurement while the meter is removed, which outfit to use to test the  meter, and what the standards for testing the meter should be.  Emily--pls get a meeting set up for today if possible.  All-I suspect I've inadvertently left some key people off this distribution, so please route as necessary.  DF

I realize the below referenced classes are during PRC.  I have talked with Frazier and here is our game plan for the
teams.  If you can attend one of the sessions below, please make every effort to attend.  If you cannot attend, then let Ava know and she

all attend the meeting or see the video.  

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn

From Drew Fossum

The Enron Transportation Services Legal Department will present the Annual Antitrust Program in Houston on:

May 8		EB5C2		2:00-3:00 p.m.
May 17		EB49C2	3:00-4:00 p.m.
May 22		EB5C2		2:00-3:00 p.m.

Refreshments will be served.

It is ETS's policy that all marketing and business development personnel attend this seminar each year.  The purpose of this program is to provide a refresher on basic antitrust laws and ""Do's and don'ts"" for conducting business.  IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU ATTEMPT TO ARRANGE YOUR SCHEDULE TO ATTEND.  PLEASE MAKE SURE TO SIGN IN WHEN YOU ATTEND.

The May 17 session will be transmitted to the video conference rooms in both Maitland and Omaha.  As seating for the May 17 video presentation is limited in all locations, please call the following for reservations for that date;

Houston (30 seats)	Janet Cones	X 3-1540
Omaha (3C1-20 seats)	Ann Smith 	X 7091
Maitland (20 seats)	Jimmy Dowden 	X 7080 
		
Because the video conference room in Omaha will not accommodate all personnel, a video tape presentation will be scheduled by Dari Dornan for Northern personnel and by Janet Place for Northern Border personnel.  

If extenuating circumstances prevent any personnel in Houston from attending, please call Janet Cones (X 3-1530) to see the video tape.

Please be advised that in addition to the annual antitrust presentation, ETS Legal also provides an on-line Antitrust Handbook for you easy reference.  To access the Handbook, go to the ""Enron Transportation Services"" Intranet site, click on ""ETS Legal"", then click on ""Antitrust Handbook and Standards of Conduct"".  

Attorneys will receive CLE credit.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

The NNG Doc System is now open and  ready for your updates on OBA imbalances.  Please input your updates before Tuesday, June 19th, 5pm.

The reason for the short timeframe is due to the WINDOWS 2000 upgrades on the nights of June 19 & 20 and the unavailability of the DOC system during this time.

Dear All

Thank you very much for agreeing to meet with Mauro Formaggio during his visit to Enron in Houston on 23 & 24 August.

As Alfredo wrote in previous e-mails:

""Mr Formaggio is a very precious contact at the Italian Energy Authority, and he is very much involved in the drafting of regulations regarding third party access to pipelines, and despatch/operational rules for transcos. He expects to learn from us about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities).""

Mr Formaggio anticipates being available all day on Thursday 23rd and Friday 24th so I hope you might be able to find some time to meet with him on those days.  Perhaps if you asked your respective assistants to let me know times that do NOT suit you on those dates & how long you think it will appropriate for you to meet with him, I can draw up a schedule?

Joe - I cannot discern from previous e-mails whether you will be in Houston on 23 & 24 August & if you are, whether you will have time to see Mr Formaggio?

Thank you & regards

Dear Mr Formaggio

Sorry for taking so long to communicate with you about your trip to Houston later this month.

The dates of 23 and 24 August suit the relevant people at Enron in Houston so I trust that those dates are still convenient for you?

The people with whom I am in the process of confirming meetings are as follows:

1. 	Joe Hartsoe, Vice President, Regulatory & Legislative Affairs
	Joe is our FERC expert.  He works out of our Washington, DC office but I am hoping that he may be able to travel to 
	Houston to meet with you.

2. 	Rebecca Cantrell or Leslie Lawner, Directors, Regulatory Affairs 
	Either of these two women can give you a shipping perspective so I will arrange for you to meet one of them.

3. 	Dannis Bellard, Gas Control
	Dannis will give you a gas control tour

4. 	Lynn Blair, Director, Customer Services
	Lynn will discuss transportation, scheduling, OBA, TPA matter with you.
	
5. 	Shelley Corman, Gas Logistics and Communications
	Shelley heads up the Gas Logistics group & she will make to meet with you.

I will confirm the meetings once I know when you are arriving and departing Houston.

Please let me know if you need assistance booking flights, airport transfers & a hotel in Houston - Enron has corporate rates with two hotels within walking distance to the Enron building so do let me know if you would like me to make any reservations on your behalf.

Please also let me know if you have any questions.

I can appreciate your desire to understand management's role in reviewing and monitoring the controls that this meeting and the detailed status reports provide and would like to help you gain confidence in our process. 

You mentioned that you would be ""observing the process and not the content"".  I would like to discuss this in more detail with you due to the sensitivity of the customer information being discussed.

Subject:	Monthly Customer Accounts Meeting

Rick,

Several of the monitoring reports that we use as a part of our internal
controls testing (i.e., A/R status report prepared by Alice, material PPAs,
etc.) are reviewed by management at the monthly customer accounts meeting.
Testing management's review of these reports is a key monitoring control
that we are attempting to obtain evidence of.  Due to the fact that there
is not a formal ""sign-off"" on these reports by Shelley, yourself, etc., we
need to obtain another form of evidence that they are being reviewed.  One
way to do this is for one of our people to sit in on a couple of the
meetings and observe the process.  Additionally, we would also need the
reports themselves in the form of copies of the packet used during the
meeting (I think Alice was going to talk to you about this).

Being able to observe these meetings would allow us to get comfortable that
the specific reports are being reviewed by management, and would alleviate
any need to perform detailed substantive testing on the reports themselves.
That testing could be fairly labor-intensive on both sides.

Realizing there may be a confidentiality/sensitivity issue related to the
content of the meeting, I want to ensure you that we would only be there to
observe the process and not analyze the content.

Please let me or Heather know your thoughts on this and whether or not
someone from our group would be able to attend the next meeting to be held
and probably one more after that.  Thanks Rick.

Tony

Subject:	US Energy Carlton Request


As you know, USE is agent for a number of small Carlton sourcers.  They have contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE's clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper's Carlton obligation gas in on the shippers' individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to confirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE asked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate the gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlton gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they are agent.

I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal obstacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contract
can only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.

I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would seem to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE's supplier would nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from the Admin contract to its clients' individual firm contracts.  

Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could work something out.

Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special scheduling logic in TMS, 
it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US Energy's request.
With the current work load, Gerry didn't think IT could get the changes made by November 1 
but may have something in place for December.

Should we pursue?

Subject:	FDD Status for Dec 19th, 2001

Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.

Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.


The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.

The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.

The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.

BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.

The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.

Overall FDD is 94.36% full.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Let me clarify a point about the Performance Evaluation due dates:

The written reviews are due in HR by January 2 (not signed off by employee)

You ARE NOT required to have completed all your employee review meetings by January 2

You can start discussions as soon as you have completed the reviews, but the discussion should focus around performance.

No variable pay or merit discussions should take place in the performance review meeting.  Those will take place on or around January 18.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time? [Blair, Lynn]   Greg, if there is a transportation path from field to
demarc def, then the path is a part of the demarc allocation.  If there is a transportation path from field to demarc, then
	demarc to demarc def., the transportation path is considered in the demarc allocation, but the storage path
	will not be considered until the storage allocation.  
If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]   Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Def.
 The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarc def.

I put a stored procedure on etsadhoc...adhoctest.  It is called jlowry.storage_report.  It expects two parameters, 1. the gas date and 2. the service type (FDD, IDD, or SBA).

I believe the calculations are what you requested in your document.  I have not worked on the swing calculation because I'm not sure I have access to all the required data.  Also, I think you probably want the scheduled withdrawal to be a negative number so you'll get the net when you add injection and withdrawal together.  I essentially changed your net calculation to be injection - withdrawal, rather than adding the two together.  If this is wrong, let me know and I'll correct it.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Alice,
the information you need from TMS can be found in the etsadhoc database of ETSADHOC server (ETSADHOC.ets.enron.com; ip address: 172.30.10.144).
Depending on whether you need nomination or scheduled information, you will need to query against either the Nom or Sched table.

Let me know if you need more information

Thanx

I need to identify where certain storage and imbalance information reside on the  adhoc server. The attached document lists the data that is needed and where the data is in TMS. The next step is to identify which database stores the required information. 

Esther Dasilva has done some research and  found that part of this information is on the NNG adhoc database. We need your assistance to complete the mapping of this data to the adhoc tables. Can you meet with me and Esther on Tuesday to direct us to the correct path on mapping this data (see attached)?

Lynn,

Thanks for your help getting this pushed along.  Shouldn't we take the approach that payment to Northern is expected immediately once Oneok verifies the liquid is condensate.  Whether they ever reach agreement with their hauler or not is not germane to paying us.  We have been pressing Oneok about Mt. Jesus since April of 2000 and provided them with a sample analysis (taken by us) September 30, 2000!  You can see by the trail of e-mails below, they seem to brush us off about once a month.

Thanks

Charlie

If determined that the liquids do have condensate in them, we will pursue

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles
Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the
Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton
Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for
picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids
removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage
attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok
monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the
condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table
below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.
This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for
removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease #
71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler
contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is
water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok
accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and
refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement
and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact
condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing
Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of
liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates
that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.
Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from
Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this
matter is appreciated.

Thanks

Richardson has agreed to send us an additional writing regarding the other justifications for the volumetric negotiated rate.   Joe Koury asked me to email the insert to the letter.   Koury told me that he would reference the July 26 order and the fact that the Commission has requested additional information as to why the shipper entered into the subject negotiated rate transaction, with Scott Walker stating that in reviewing his previous responses he would clarify by adding the following:  


Insert:  
  
Richardson Products proposed to share in a rate based on a daily spread as a volumetric rate because under that rate arrangement if the gas did not flow, Richardson was not obligated to pay Transwestern the rate.  Richardson desired to avoid the risk, under normal demand service, of having to pay the rate if the gas did not flow.   The issue of whether the gas would flow was a very real one at the California border (Needles delivery point) given the manner in which SoCalGas, the downstream party, confirms volumes for delivery with Transwestern.   Specifically, SoCalGas has a windowing procedure whereby it limits the amount of gas that Transwestern can deliver into Needles based on SoCalGas' allocation procedures and the amount of available takeaway capacity at the delivery point. [True?]  Simply stated, if SoCalGas did not confirm Richardson's nomination at the Needles delivery point, the gas would not flow.    The negotiated rate, as opposed to the rate for normal demand service, allowed Richardson to avoid the risks associated with Richardson's gas not flowing due to SoCalGas's windowing procedure.   

 Pls. review and comment asap.   I promised Joe K.  I would get it to him tonight or first thing tomorrow because he will be out all next week and agreed to take care of this matter this week.  Thanks, Maria

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

Hey guys....I need to take vacation on August 23rd & 24th. I will be taking, what's become, my semi-annual pilgrimage to Aggieland. I'll be moving Daughter No. 2 into her new swingin' college apartment. 

If all goes right I can get everything transported and moved in on Thursday....which will give my body three days - Friday, Saturday and Sunday to recover from the ordeal.  

Any problems?

Transwestern Denies Withheld Capacity to Boost Negotiated Deals 
A Transwestern Pipeline executive yesterday dismissed allegations that the pipeline withheld firm transportation capacity bound for California from its recourse-rate shippers last winter in order to free up more capacity for contracts at substantially higher negotiated rates. 
Mary Kay Miller, vice president of rates and certificates, acknowledged Transwestern may have had discussions and exchanged faxes (prior to posting its available capacity) with two shippers -- Sempra Energy and Richardson Products II Ltd. -- that subsequently entered into negotiated-rate transactions. But she stressed that requests for capacity by Sempra Energy and Richardson were considered ""moot"" by the pipeline until after the available operational capacity was posted. 
""Even if they would have sent...a fax the day before"" capacity became available, ""it would have been irrelevant because there was no capacity posted"" at that time, said Miller. Capacity requests that came in prior to Jan. 31, the day that available capacity was posted for February contracts on Transwestern, were ""null and void."" The only ""relevant"" ones were those that Transwestern received on or after Jan. 31, she noted. 
Miller spent much of Wednesday on the stand being quizzed by lawyers for FERC and producers about Transwestern's methods for notifying customers about available capacity, the manner in which it chooses winning bids and about its pre-posting contacts with Sempra Energy and Richardson. 
It was the first day of a FERC hearing exploring charges that Transwestern exercised market power in awarding negotiated-rate contracts that led to shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's maximum allowed rate of 38 cents/MMBtu for firm transportation service to the California border. The Commission proceeding yesterday focused on four negotiated-rate contracts of Sempra Energy and Richardson for a total 45,000 MMBtu/d of service on Transwestern during February and March. 
Richardson and Sempra ""clearly did not have any 'deal' entitling them to the posted capacity before it was posted,"" Miller said in prepared rebuttal testimony. The two companies ""had the right to the capacity only 'after' they submitted their bids, 'after' the posting period ended, 'after' Transwestern determined that no other bids were submitted, and 'after' a contract was agreed upon between Transwestern, Richardson or Sempra,"" she noted. 
Despite claims made by FERC energy industry analyst Barry E. Sullivan to the contrary, ""Transwestern did not withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse rates in order to make the capacity available under substantially higher negotiated rates,"" Miller testified. 
Sullivan, an analyst in the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates' (OMTR) Division of Litigation, contends that Transwestern threatened to withhold capacity unless shippers agreed to negotiated rates (see Daily GPI, Aug. 29 <http://www.intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010829e.html>). In fact, he believes the pre-posting discussions between Transwestern and shippers were intended to raise doubts about the availability of capacity at the maximum recourse rate, so that shippers might be more ""willing to enter into negotiated-rate contracts above the recourse rate, in the hope of securing some of the capacity if and when [it became] available."" But Miller counters that Sullivan ""offers not support for his claim."" 
She noted that even Sempra Energy and Richardson, in response to a data request by Southern California Edison, support Transwestern's claims. Both companies replied ""no"" when asked whether ""any employee of Transwestern or any Transwestern affiliate ever indicated at any time that Transwestern would not provide the capacity at the maximum tariff rate."" 
The ""capacity at issue was offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate in the exact same manner that all other capacity is offered on Transwestern's web site at the recourse rate; there was no prohibition, restrictions, limitation, condition or suggestion that a potential shipper could not bid for the capacity at the recourse rate; and any potential shipper, including Richardson or Sempra, could have submitted a bid for the capacity at the recourse rate."" 
Sullivan contends that Transwestern's motive for allegedly advancing negotiated-rate transactions at the expense of recourse-rate deals was pure profit. Under questioning by Thomas J. Burgess of FERC's OMTR, Miller conceded that Transwestern earned $1.8 million from Sempra Energy's contract in March, $1.3 million from Richardson's March contract, and a ""comparable"" amount from Richardson's February contract. She noted the pipeline received a ""substantially higher"" amount as a result of Sempra's February contract, but she didn't provide an exact figure. FERC's Sullivan estimated the pipeline's profit from the Sempra February contract was more than $5 million. 
Sullivan said that much of the profits that wound up in Transwestern's coffers would have gone to Sempra Energy and Richardson if they have been able to acquire the capacity at recourse rates. But Miller countered that the Commission's negotiated-rate policy ""does not require a minimum level of profit to shippers or contemplate any hindsight analysis of whether shippers could have gotten a better deal or made more profits."" 
Furthermore, she said the Transwestern case shouldn't be used to consider changes to the negotiated-rate policy, as Sullivan has suggested. This case ""is the wrong forum for such an issue because modifying the negotiated-rate policy should only be done on an industry-wide basis so no pipeline or group of pipeline customers is competitively disadvantaged.""

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

Karen has a real phobia about spiders.  One time Karen and I and three of our team members went out to lunch.  As we were leaving the restaurant, Karen was sitting in the back seat.  I started backing the car out of the parking lot when Karen screamed.  Thought I had hit someone.  I looked back and Karen was climbing on top of Anita and Bill trying to get in the back window.  She had spotted a spider that had dropped down on a drag line.  That's when we decided to help Karen get over her phobia.  We started planting little plastic spiders in all her file folders and desk drawers.  So for the next couple years we would hear Karens little scream when she would run across our little surprise.  Think we helped her get over her phobia.  I'm sure when she sees a spider now she probably remembers her old teammates.

Karen is the official Food Monitor for the team.  She tracks the fat grams and caloric intake for those of us who can't count but love to eat.  We are always excited when she is gone on vacation because we don't have to hide our food.

Karen has done an excellent job of handling one of our most difficult interconnecting pipelines.  The customers love Karen's positive attitude and great sense of humor.

Karen carries a contagious disease called ""A love of life"" with an upbeat, positive attitude and an infectious giggle that surrounds our team.

"RE: question of curiosity!!!","	Mary and Dari, here is my answer.  Are you comfortable with it
	before I send it to the shipper.  Thanks. Lynn

	Answer:  If an interruptible shipper is bumped in the Intraday 1
	         cycle, the shipper will keep 1/3 of their scheduled volumes.
	         Shippers schedule becomes their actual unless they are the
		   operator of the point.  Therefore, they would not encounter
	         a DDVC penalty.  If the Shipper is the operator, NNG looks at
		   total scheduled volumes vs total actual delivered volumes and determines
		   if a DDVC is appropriate.  The DDVC is based on the difference
		   between total scheduled and the actual delivery at the point.  

	If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.
	Lynn Blair (713-853-7637).

DDVC penalties are applicable to the bumped shipper's quantity.

Gas Control we need to call  Mid Am by around 5:45 P.M.

                           Concur Expense (XMS)
                             Common Questions


   1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
   Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document
   Library.   Go to the following link:
   http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the
   XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

   2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it
   cost?
   Answer: Go to the following link:
   http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your
   Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the
   following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur
   Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll
   button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

   3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense
   system?
   Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of
   our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur
   Expense.

   4. How can I view my old expense reports?
   Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will
   be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them
   to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old
   expense reports.

   5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
   Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to
   Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links
   section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the
   screen when entering expense reports.

   6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
   Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to
   Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links
   section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top
   of the screen when entering expense reports

   7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur
   Expense?
   Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this
   problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC
   will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

   8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
   Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20
   minutes of inactivity.

   9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
   Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the
   XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder
   and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign
   Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

   10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur
   Expense?
   Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log
   into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of
   the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the
   help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful
   information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed
   above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

   11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new
   Concur Expense system?
   Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
   ?  The first screen only has one tab instead of two
   ? New expense types were added
   ? Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
   ? Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
   ? The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been
     separated out


   Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at
   713-345-4727.

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 
Importance:	High

Gerry/Lynn:

Yes, the volume nominated to the inlet/from the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total.   

At a high-level,  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inlet/outlet that causes an override (per se) of a contract's MDQ allowing shippers to ""double"" their contract MDQ. 

I did a preliminary check (using model office) to confirm coding logic at the nomination level......looking at K#6425 (BP Energy) that has a total contract MDQ of 20,835 MMbtu.   When nominating above the 20,835 K# MDQ; you can only nominate to inlet/from outlet up to the contract's MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 (current business).  Any additional vols. nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 (overrun).  

We do have shippers that nom in to & out of the plant on the same contract... .....initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton; i.e., same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet.    The IT Group ; however, could run a quick report to check/confirm this.  

Hope I answered your questions......

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical

	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Zone Allocations

It may be standard practice in your opinion, but Kelly, Bill and I have never heard of this or remember it happening to us.  Also Entergy-Koch was completely surprised by it as well.  We just can't understand why you would call a reduction in a withdrawal an injection.  Your allocation is limiting storage injections and we were not making an injection.  We'd like to know where to find this in the tariff so we can read it and understand it better.  We pulled looked at the 8 a.m. process instructions on the web and it doesn't say anything about this.

What is really upsetting to us is were thought we were set up fine to be in compliance with the SUL and suddenly we couldn't do what we thought we had a right to do, even though Hot Tap accepted the nomination.  On top of that, no one from NNG called us to let us know that our nomination had been undone and the same thing would have happened to us on the 11/15 gas day if we hadn't been lucky enough to have found it on our own.  We pushed the gas across to ANR, but we are going to incur penalties from them as a result.  The other really strange thing is that during the intraday processes we can cut back on our withdrawal even though storage is allocated, but you can't do it at 8 a.m.  It just doesn't make any sense to us.

Jeff, I am sorry WP&L and IES are experiencing allocation problems.  It
is standard procedure during a storage (injection) allocation the 8 am
true up process does not allow FDD withdrawal reductions or storage
injections.  Many other shippers are also working hard to manage their
business.  Other than getting truer information on your market's needs
or finding alternate markets for your excess capacity, I don't have any
other ideas on how to address your zone allocations.

As requested I will add this item to our December 10 meeting agenda.

Chris

You should know that we are unhappy about something else now.  For the
11/14 gas day you (NNG) did not let us reduce our FDD withdrawal
nomination to zero in the 8 am process like normal because of a storage
injection allocation.  Because of this WP&L is going to get hit with SUL
DDVC penalties. Entergy-Koch who handles the IES assests was surprised
by this as well and IES may incur penalties too.

We weren't trying to make an injection, we were just trying to cut our
withdrawal to zero.  We always schedule a maximum withdrawal in the
winter because we are always at risk of a zone allocaton just like we
have been seeing lately.  We've had conference call with Jean Blair and
Jerry Wilkens on the topic.  We are also in trouble now for the 11/15
gas day, which we are current trying to figure a way out of.  You can
add this item to our discussion topics when you visit.

why he is getting allocated at the zone level when he is trying to

Subject:	Outstanding Invoices

Enron Transportation Services has 2115 outstanding invoices totaling nearly $8.5 million, which need coding and/or approval in the iPayit system.  Although a company-wide task force is working to improve the entire process, ETS employees need to do their part to ensure accurate and timely payment to our vendors.  
 
If you purchase items that generate an invoice (including cell phones, pagers, etc.) or if you are responsible for coding and/or approving invoices, after you receive your e-mail notification, please log on to iPayit and take the appropriate action to process the invoice (s) .  
 
Because the invoice (s)  cannot be processed for payment while it is in your iPayit inbox, it's important to code/approve invoices within five (5) days of e-mail notification.  
 
I expect ETS to stay current on payment of ALL vendor invoices.  
 
I have approved invoices in the system and it's very to use.  We will continue to monitor the status of our accounts payable, and we expect to see significant improvement by the end of September.
 
If you need assistance processing outstanding invoices, please contact Carolyn Centilli at 713-345-8496.   Password questions should be directed to the ISC help desk, 713-345-4727.

Lynn:  Please verify that if Koch realigns their 35,000/d contract (K# 20510)such that their MDQ at Carlton matches their Carlton flow obligation of 2,828 and has the rest of their 32,172/d at Marshall (They would need to realign 30 mcf from Carlton to Marshall to effectuate the above, and I've checked with Doug Aschwege to make sure he would approve it.) that Steve's and my interpretation as described below is correct.  Basically the question is whether the Carlton flow obligation is only the Tariff stated volume (ie., no fuel imputed) and that the remainder of the MDQ plus fuel on the whole 35,000/d will flow as primary firm receipts at Marshall.  Thanks for your help!

Bob, 

Per our conversations earlier this month,  My contract 20510 needs to have
only 2828 mmbtu at Carlton and 32172 at Marshall.  All of the fuel for the
transport needs to be taken from Marshall.  Currently, this contract has
2858 at Carlton.  This is 30 above my obligation.  After this change is
made, it is my expectation that under no circumstances will my volume at
Carlton be curtailed below a receipt volume of 32568 at Marshall.   A
combination of 2828 plus 32568 gives me a delivered volume of 35000.  That
is my firm entitlement and curtailments below that are unacceptable as long
as my nominations are primary FT.

Please contact me at 713-544-4017 if more clarification is needed.

Thank you.  

Steve Phillips

Rick and Lynn,

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

Larry

Subject: Northern Natural Gas

I have some questions about data that I have been downloading from the
NNG/Enron website.  I am not sure you are the correct person to contact
about these questions but I am hoping you can help or at least point me in
the correct direction.

I am looking at three different pieces of data - Index of Customers, Tariff
information and Capacity Release data.  I am having trouble understanding
the way your pipeline works and I am hoping someone will be able to help.
One of the major questions I have is why the rate schedules differ so much
between these three pieces of data, IOC lists the rate schedules on
contracts as TF_M_11_3, TF_M_4_10, or TF_F_1_12. Tariff lists the schedule
TF with various rates under it, TF_12 base, TF_12 variable and TF5 (all
under the market to market heading), TFF under the Field to Field /market
Demarcation heading, etc. ,  and in capacity release I see rate schedules
that look different still, TF5-TF5, TF7-TFF, TF2-TF12, TFX1-TFX Mkt Apr-Oct.
I am trying to reconcile the differences and I can get a little ways but
then I run into problems.  For instance, in the IOC, I am assuming TF_M_11_3
means TF rate- Market to Market- flowing from Nov-March.  But then I see a
contract that has the TF_M_11_3 rate schedule that flows from April thru Oct
(according to effective and expiration dates of the contract) and I get
confused again.  I can correlate some of the capacity release rates to
tariff, TF5-TF5 corresponding to TF5 under the TF rate, but then I get to
TF7-TFF and I am not sure where the TF7 comes from or what it correlates to.
I know there must be some way to look at all this together, but I am at a
loss to figure it out, which is why I am asking for your help.

I have never nominated on your pipeline, but instead am just doing data
collection and analysis.  There are more questions I need to have answered
and would like to be able to contact someone so that I can talk with them
and gain an understanding of how your pipeline works.  Could you please give
me a call or direct me to whom I need to speak?  I can be reached at
720.548.5470.

One more thought - is there perhaps a ""handbook"" that I would be able to
read that might answer some of these questions for me, perhaps a nomination
guideline that you might give to a new trader/scheduler?  If so, please mail
me a copy to 3333 Walnut Street  Boulder, CO  80301.

Thank you so much for you help in this!  I appreciate anything you can do
for me.

The EDI Hub Operations group is implementing a new system for the Team EDI web page.  The move to production is planned to begin on Saturday, September 15th at 6:00 p.m. and should be complete around 3:00 a.m. on Sunday, September 16th.  EDI files will continue to be processed until 11 p.m.  At that time, there will be a total disruption of EDI service until Sunday morning at 3 a.m.  Paging will still be in effect until 11 p.m.  To verify that all EDI files have been processed Saturday evening, please page the EDI production support pager at 713.327.3893.  The oncall person for the EDI Hub is Sanjay and he will have access to outstanding file information.  Also, I can be paged at 800.506.0472.  

To access the new Team EDI system on Sunday morning, continue to use the links/addresses, logon IDs and passwords that you use today.  The new system will look like the current system, but will have a couple of enhancements that will be discussed in a later memo.

If you have any questions, please e-mail me or page me.

I found your name on the site, I'm guessing you might be the best person to
lob this question towards...

I'm looking at operational capacity on this site
http://www.tw.enron.com/twdb/etfr_avcap.html
And I can input the gas day, for today or tomorrow.  But when I get results
back it is ambiguous as to which cycle the gas is flowing in.  Are they all
for the timely cycle or are the evening and intraday cycles thrown in there
as well.  And if they are thrown in there, do I just have to know WHEN the
different cycles are posted and use that as my guide (IE if I'm looking at
results around 14:00 those would be for intraday1 cycle)????

Are you even the person I should ask?

As you know, the IT team has been working on the small talk upgrade code changes over the past few months & it has been mved into model office this week for testing. This upgrade is a fairly large change for TMS and will require us to test all screens, functions. Icons, and process which includes approximately 100 screens/reports/processes for each of the pipes. Our deadline to complete this is 7/15/01. If possible, we would like to to ask for both Kathy Washington and Lynda Laferla to assist  us in the testing.  Please let me know if that would be possible.

Thanks Again for your help !

Subject:	RE: US Energy/LS Power storage allocation issue

I want to clarify the problem. In researching the problem I found that the rate retrieved for PnR was slightly higher than the rate retrieved for FDD Overrun. In our discussions with Bill Anderson, we focused  on how this impacted the contract he asked us to review. Bottom line is in storage allocations, the LSP -Whitewater overrun activity should have received a greater portion of the available injection capacity.
The IT group is correcting the problem. The 7.61 cent PnR rate will be hard coded in the allocation program this afternoon as interim fix until the proper system modifications are ready.

Subject:	US Energy/LS Power storage allocation issue
Importance:	High

Hello,

Mike Bodnar and I called Bill Anderson at US Energy today regarding his complaints about the storage allocation process.  Bill has claimed that LS Power is being allocated down to zero on days when he should be receiving a pro-rata share of the overrun injections on any given day throughout the summer.  

Mike found out that LS Power - Whitewater was being incorrectly allocated down to zero on certain days throughout the summer due to the system pointing to an incorrect (discounted) overrun rate for the storage account of LS Power - Whitewater.  LS Power was being charged the full, non-discounted overrun rate on their FDD contract.  

US Energy will undoubtedly want to negotiate a settlement of some sort, since they believe this has been an issue since 6/1/01.   

I believe we need to do the following:

1 - Determine if the other LS Power plant (Cottage Grove) was also affected by this system error.
2 - Determine the date that the incorrect rate took affect.
3 - Determine how LS Power overrun injections throughout this summer were affected by this, since 6/1/01.
4 - Determine a fair and equitable solution to this issue (as of 6/1/01) to present to the customer within three weeks.

I will set up a video meeting as soon as possible with regards to this issue.

Tim Johanson

Subject:	NSP PowerPac Issues

Lynn,

Following our discussion yesterday afternoon, Reyna and I came back and reviewed the NSP powerpac agreement.  We were specifically looking for language in this agreement which may require us to true up for the customer regardless of whether or not we were allocating storage on a given gas day.  We couldn't put our finger on any language in the current agreement (dated April 1, 2001) that requires us to true up for them, but perhaps we overlooked or misinterpreted something.  We would appreciate guidance from you or Bob using your interpretation of the agreement with regard to the following issues:
According to the current agreement, what are our obligations to true up for the shipper  a) if we have allocated storage for a given gas day? and b) if the shipper fails to enter a nom for a given gas day?  Also, by what time is the true up required to be made? 

We would also like to clarify these same sort of issues for the Great River Energy powerpac, just to be certain that we are all in agreement as to how they are handled.  I'm anticipating that we may have future deals of this nature, so anything we can do to alleviate confusion in future agreements would be beneficial.

Thanks for your help!

Kay

Subject:	Outbound TMS Messages

With yesterday's e-mail outage behind us, I think we need to investigate the ability to keep outbound TMS messages and Critical Notices flowing during these periods of virus infiltration.  TMS generates cut notices after each scheduling cycle and with extended outages of mailman.enron.com, we are losing a critical channel of communication to customers.  Customers rely on these messages to inform them of business changes.  In addition, ETS critical notices generated by X-12 cannot be sent out during these periods.  They are called ""critical notices"" because of the immediacy of when a customer needs to react.   

I do think we need to know the following:  

1.  Could a message generated by TMS cause further infection of the e-mail systems?
2.  Can the critical notices cause further infection of Enron's e-mail systems?    
3.  Is it possible to keep outbound messages from systems other than Exchange flowing during virus interruptions?  

This is a significant reliability issue and ETS customer communications were disrupted for approximately 8 hours yesterday.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Subject:	Final Review of FERC California Reporting - August 2001
Importance:	High

Please review the spreadsheets attached.  These are my notes associated with any outstanding items requiring final review/approval:

Item 1 - I have received the remainder of outstanding rates from TK and populated into the PDT records.  TK/Lindy, please provide email if corrections are necessary.
Item 3 - After discussions with Lynn, we chose to round up Daily Max Flowing Capacity for gas days 8/1 and 8/3 (both from 1,092,956 to 1,093,000) so this would not raise questions or require footnote explanations.  I have also updated the footnotes and comments provided by Terry/Darrell/Lynn and populated accordingly into PDS and PFS.
Item 4 - I compared the daily scheduled volumes by California delivery point provided under RP00-241-000 (CPUC vs El Paso) SCE-7 against the volumes extracted from TMS and highlighted the nine records having discrepancies, where the data to the right of the matrix is the amount reported in the prior request.  I would recommend that we adjust to the previously reported volumes.  I was not able to extract the website operational capacity volumes for each point in the West of Thoreau area; however, I did verify that the monthly Total Scheduled System Volume (PDSM) less the monthly Total Scheduled Volume at each California Point (PPSM) equaled the usage volumes billed to all customers delivering to East of California delivery points.

Provide comments to the entire distribution list in this email no later than Thursday at 1pm.  

Omaha - I will separate each tab and save as a separate Excel file using the file name convention as defined by the FERC.  I believe we need to provide both a hardcopy and a CD.  Is the current Excel format with headers acceptable for the hardcopy version?   Additionally, do I need to delete the headers for the electronic files on CD?  Unless otherwise instructed, I will email the final version of all four files for final disposition by Regulatory in Omaha no later than 3pm.  Please advise if there is anything else needed from Houston.

	 


Thanks,
Elizabeth

Mike,

I spoke with Steve Sweeney at Cogentrix today regarding this spreadsheet, and he would like to see our data for every day from June 1, 2001 through September 30, 2001 as you calculated for the few random days throughout the summer.  The spreadsheet seems to indicate that we did not allocate Cogentrix on some of the days in question.  This information is contrary to the information Steve provided and must be explored further. 

Steve is getting impatient with this process.  He would like to see this come to a resolution as soon as possible.  I said that I understand his concern and we will do our best to resolve this in a timely matter.  

Kent, once Mike finishes the spreadsheet, I recommend that we meet and discuss our offer to Cogentrix.

Hey Steve,
Kim and I have been looking at your spreadsheet.  I am attaching our
spreadsheet so you can see how we came up with our numbers.  It looks like
there is a pricing problem on your spreadsheet.  You have a price for
1/18/00 and there isn't pricing for that day.  The Jan00L tab in our
spreadsheet calculates the current invoice.  The Jan00S tab calculates what
we should have paid, inclusive of PPAs.  Kim tells me that our worksheets
are per the contract.  If you have questions, please email me or give me a

I only included on the address list the ones that I could think of off the top of my head who regularly attend the meeting, so please don't think I've limited the list and please pass this on to the others who attend. 

The microphones in Houston are extremely sensitive to any noise. Paper shuffling is the biggest problem. Even ""straightening"" papers or turning a page has the effect of blocking out the speakers voice. Gas Dailies should be left at your desk. Whispering can also be heard. It tends to make it very difficult to hear in Omaha. It is also imperative that the microphone be put very near the person who speaking, particularly if their voice doesn't carry. I don't quite understand when it can pick up whispers, but can't pick up a softer speaker's voice, but that's the way it is. I think if we are all aware of that, we can greatly enhance the quality of the meeting for the Omaha participants. thanks sj

Dear Rebecca,
that sorrow tragedy, those coward attacks are beyond any expression of sadness and reproach.
I do believe that those who are responsible for the cowardly attacks be soon discovered and punished.
I also feel that in these times there is at stake the fundamental issue of Liberty, for all of us.
Just before coming to visit you I took part to a conference in Dallas, where Chairman WiIlliams of RCC gave a speech. 
It occurs to me recalling his words to the audience, at the end of his speech

I agree with Hasan, changing the ""Scheduled Quantities Report"" to ""Operator Scheduled Quantities Report"".  Leave the meter bounce off the name since the meter bounce is an internal option only.

Subject:	RE: Scheduled quantity reports

The view in TMS that is used for submitting shipper scheduled quantity reports is also used for submitting Meter Bounce Report and Operator Scheduled Quantity Report.  I agree with Maggie, Terry and everyone else who has pointed out this fact and also that the new scheduled quantity reports are available only for shippers.

My recommendation will be that we remove the ability to submit the old Shipper Scheduled Quantity report and leave in place the ability to submit either the Operator Scheduled Quantity or Meter Bounce report.  Below is a snap shot of options currently on the TMS launcher

 << OLE Object: Picture (Device Independent Bitmap) >> 

I would also suggest that we change options on the TMS launcher.  Where it currently says 'Scheduled Quantities Report' change it to say something like 'Operator Scheduled Quantity/Meter Bounce'.

Hasan,

The new Service Requestor Report does not have operator information and the Scheduled Quantity Report does have the operator option.  We need to discuss this further before making a decision to turn the old reports off.

Subject:	Scheduled quantity reports

All,
some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.

At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.

Thanks

Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  [Blair, Lynn]  Yes, during same cycle, but at a different time.
Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time?

If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]  Customers can pick up gas at demarc def.  
The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarch def.

Keith here are some of the points I observed that were off rate for July 1st. gas day.

                                           Order          24 avg flow
GPM Linam Ranch       55.8                  82.3           +26.5
Shell Tippett                   43.8                  47.0                3.2
Plymouth                          17.0                  29.4              12.4
CRA Mertzon                   38.2                 47.7                 9.5

Mitchell had a 46.5 schedule to us but average 19.8 due to not noticing that they had a schedule to us until 5:00 PM.  that after noon. As you know one of your responsibilities is to monitor ALL  points and make calls to stations that are not on rate and notify scheduling so they can make their calls. Cunningham was on Peak Alert all weekend and we were calling for MAX Injection, Redfield was suppose to be on 50,000 inj. for the weekend but was brought up to 200,000 inj. due to too much gas on the system.  My observation is that if calls would have been made on these points that are long to us it would have helped our situation. I would suggest that you pay close attention all orders for every cycle so that you do not miss a change and to continually review flows vs. orders through out the day.

Could I get more information on what the point issues are with the Oneok OBA's?  Are there certain contracts in question? Does it have to do with crossing mids, or operators of points, or having receipts and deliveries on the same OBA?  

Also, can someone be called in from my group to attend just the portion of the meeting when you discuss the above?  We are all involved in testing for the new CMS/CRS systems and if we are not needed for the entire meeting, it would help to only attend the portion we are needed.

Let me know

	11:30 - 12:00  -  Lunch in the building (Ava can you get Trebeards)

	12:00 - 4:30   -  Discuss:

				Midcontinent Market Center I/C at Bushton
				Points that are on the wrong OBA
				Imbalances on the Gathering OBA
				American Processing Issues (Robert)

	Let me know if we need to add anything else or have any quetions.  I think this will take the majority of
	the afternoon.  

	Ava, please get us a room (preferrably 4102) for the afternoon.  

	Attendees from Oneok are:  Delaine Kurth, Kim Hardman, Sherry Rogers, maybe one other person.

	Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 
Importance:	High

Gerry/Lynn:

Yes, the volume nominated to the inlet/from the outlet is factored into a firm contracts MDQ total.   

At a high-level,  there should be no special MDQ-related coding at Bushton inlet/outlet that causes an override (per se) of a contract's MDQ allowing shippers to ""double"" their contract MDQ. 

I did a preliminary check (using model office) to confirm coding logic at the nomination level......looking at K#6425 (BP Energy) that has a total contract MDQ of 20,835 MMbtu.   When nominating above the 20,835 K# MDQ; you can only nominate to inlet/from outlet up to the contract's MDQ utilizing transaction type 01 (current business).  Any additional vols. nominated above the contract MDQ must then be nominated as transaction type 02 (overrun).  

We do have shippers that nom in to & out of the plant on the same contract... .....initial research indicated there are contracts that are identical on the inlet and outlet of Bushton; i.e., same contract nominating to inlet is the same contract picking up the gas at the outlet.    The IT Group ; however, could run a quick report to check/confirm this.  

Hope I answered your questions......

	if you are not the person to help us on this, please let me know who.  Also in talking
	with Mary Darveaux she said if you use the same contract at the inlet and outlet of
	Bushton, you DO double your MDQ.  Therefore, if you have 10,000 MDQ you can 
	only nominate 5,000 to inlet and 5,000 at outlet.  

	Gerry, can we run a quick report to see if there are any contracts that are identical
	on the inlet and outlet of Bushton?   If she is right, then we have NOT had anyone
	nominate on the same contract.  If I have confused you, let's discuss.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	RE: Questions on MDQ 

So when a shipper is required (because of the producer's processing rights) to nominate from their primary receipt point to Bushton Inlet and then from the Bushton Outlet to Demarc, is that treated as one nomination from a receipt to a delivery OR is that treated as two nominations on the same contract with one receipt at their primary receipt point and another receipt at the Bushton Outlet thus exceeding the contract MDQ sending the shipper into overrun (assuming the shipper was nominating the entire MDQ throughout the path)?

Didn't we also have a situation where shippers were going from a receipt point to Demarc and not going through Bushton when they were supposed to--or maybe it was that shippers were going from Bushton Outlet to Demarc and not getting charged fuel when they weren't supposed to be able to do that transaction--I just remember something happening not too long ago.

Thanks for the help with these questions.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Larry and I met with Joanne Bisbee and Bobby Oubre on wrapping up testing on Flowing Gas.  We agreed that on Friday, July 20, we  will complete testing.

Next week (July 16-20), we will be in the testing room as much as possible to finalize all issues we have.  We have also asked that all testers be available and have their teams work with them as much as possible, so that testers can help finalize this testing.

We expect to move into production by the 25th.  Internal User review should occur the 26th - 30th.   Pilot Program for select customers targeted to commence for July 30th and should last about two weeks....  With expectation to provide full production access to all customers for July's production month commodity close.

Issues remaining:   Security concern with a couple of reports ; i.e. Imbalance Invoice; etc.
CSV Download :  Retest changes.  (Expect to finalize retesting by Monday 7/16

Time : 10:00AM - 11:30AM

They currently have two products, NetMeter and NetBalance.  The NetMeter applications looks like it would provide us with a cost effective way of making our PGAS measurement data available to our customers via the web.  NetMeter is a service they provide and our cost is based on the number of meters we post to their system.

They also have a new data validation product which will be released first quarter in 2002.  This product could be used with our PGAS system to perform some automated validation of our volume data.  Dan will be providing an overview of this product as part of this presentation.

Subject: Borderline #22 - November 1 OFO Changes


Borderline
No.  2001-22
October 30, 2001<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

 

November 1 Tariff Change

Tariff revisions detailing and addressing the use of an Operational Flow Order (OFO) on Northern Border, which were part of Northern Border's approved Park and Loan (PAL) filing, will become effective on November 1.   Here is a brief overview of the upcoming changes.

 
Purpose of an OFO
 
An OFO will be used by Northern Border to 1) alleviate conditions that threaten the integrity of the system, 2) maintain pipeline operations at pressures required to provide efficient and reliable transportation service, 3) assure adequate system line pack, and 4) maintain service for all of Northern Border's firm shippers.   
 
An OFO will be treated as a tool of last resort.  Northern Border will first attempt to utilize its system, its services (transportation and PAL), and if necessary, assistance of interconnecting systems to alleviate operational problems before invoking its OFO tariff provisions.
 
 
Posting of an OFO Watch
 
If resolution of an operational problem is unlikely, such as when a daily or cumulative OBA imbalance with an interconnected party is outside of a defined tolerance range, Northern Border will post an OFO watch.  Similar to a severe weather notice, the purpose of an OFO watch is to pre-alert shippers and interconnecting systems to a location or area on Northern Border's system in which underlying operational conditions could prompt the issuance of an OFO.
 


OFO Issuance
 
Northern Border will issue an OFO if it is determined that an OFO watch has failed to serve as a catalyst for corrective action. 
 
A Northern Border OFO will be as localized as is reasonably possible.  Furthermore, each OFO will be tailored to match the severity of the known or anticipated problem being addressed.
 
 
OFO Impact
 
An OFO can result in either the curtailment of interruptible services and/or the forced balancing of nominations and actual flows through the confirmation process.   
 
If service is reduced or interrupted due to an OFO, Northern Border will directly provide affected shippers, as soon as possible, a summary of the service interruption that will include the operational variables that prompted such action.  In addition, affected shippers will be notified of any imbalances that require immediate resolution.
 
Routine status updates will be posted throughout the period in which the OFO is in effect.
 
 
Failure to Comply
 
When an OFO is issued, it is the responsibility of the affected shippers to make a good faith effort to comply.  If such shippers fail to respond to the OFO, or their response is insufficient to correct the problem, Northern Border may take further action including the curtailment of firm service or the immediate cash out of cumulative imbalances that are in excess of 10% of the Historical Flow Quantity.
 
Northern Border will not be liable for any costs incurred by a shipper in complying with or be exposed to any damages that result from an interruption in service due to an OFO.
 
 
Impact of OFO Tariff Changes on Interconnects
 
FERC Order No. 637 requires that pipelines ""take all reasonable actions to minimize the issuance and adverse impact of Operational Flow Orders (OFOs).""  Northern Border recognizes that maintaining daily and cumulative OBA imbalances with its interconnected parties within reasonable tolerances levels is critical in meeting such obligation across the grid.  Consequently, the November 1 tariff changes includes language which define what is an acceptable tolerance range on a Northern Border OBA imbalance.
 
To serve as a benchmark, Northern Border has already begun calculating a Historical Flow Quantity (HFQ) for each point of interconnection on Northern Border's system.  The HFQ is the lesser of the average daily scheduled quantity for the previous 15 consecutive Gas Days or the actual daily flow quantity for such time period.   
 
On November 1, the default cumulative OBA imbalance tolerance level for a given interconnect on Northern Border's system will be +/- 10% of the point's HFQ.   If such approach fails to meet the needs of an interconnected party, Northern Border's tariff does permit the use of an alternative tolerance level at a given point of interconnect as long as it has been mutually agreed to both OBA parties.
 
Furthermore, the daily OBA swings at interconnects on Northern Border that are on pressure control will also be monitored more closely; the default daily OBA imbalance tolerance level will be +/- 5% of the daily scheduled quantity.  Once again, Northern Border's tariff does permit deviation from this ""standardized"" daily tolerance if an alternative method is mutually acceptable to the OBA parties. 
 
For those who would like to initiate discussions on establishing OBA imbalance tolerance levels with Northern Border that deviate from the defaults described above, please contact Scott Coburn at (402) 398.7760.

"RE: Pipeline Interconnect Forum Information","	Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as meeting you.  I wanted to let you know 
	ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.  Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
	group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.  Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her
	email address is theresa.hess@enron.com.  In talking with Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
	Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a cancellation.  

	One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the ""mis matches"" across interconnecting
	pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
	if anyone has come up with any ""great"" ideas on minimizing these mismatches.  If you would like
	to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.  

	Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn,

I am presenting Storage 101 training class on Wednesday November 7th from 2-3:30 p.m.  I am trying to keep the group at a manageable size so am just inviting marketing.  However, I wanted to know if you thought it would be a good idea to invite you, Steve J., Gary S. Darrell, John B. and Terry K. and Chris Greely (as she schedules 3rd party storage for us)?  I can't invite all of market services at this time.  I'm not sure if I want to give it to all of market  services even at a later date due to the confidential nature of the information.  What do you think?

Sue

Subject:	South Central Team

The South Central team would like to update you regarding our current status with Ruthe and Jamie's departures:

We understand you will be visiting with us regarding the changes within our team with Ruthe and Jamie's departures.  With Ruthe and Jamie's resignations, our team is now comprised of nine schedulers and two accountants.  We are interested in learning if we will be allowed to fill at least one position.  Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed -- not only for her expertise in allocations and scheduling, but in her participation in holiday/weekend coverage.  Jamie's participation in the holiday/weekend coverage will also be missed.  Of course, their daily presence in handling the telephone calls and participation in team responsibilities are also missed.  Since our team rotates the evening position in order to distribute that responsibility throughout the nine schedulers,  we will miss Ruthe and Jamie's participation in that as well -- this amounts to approximately five weeks annually each.  With the reassignment of their evenings along with holiday/weekend coverage, we are basically looking at a rotation of once every third weekend.

In the interim, we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the suggested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie's accounts.

We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we look forward to visiting with you.

Thank you,
South Central

Subject:	Thanks!

I wanted to let you know how thankful I am for the help I received from the TW scheduling group over the past couple of months as I've worked--and struggled--on the TW Daily Balancing Report. I have made repeated phone calls to Houston and have always received prompt and courteous attention from the group as I've tried to understand TMS and TW's systems and scheduling peculiarities. I have worked with Amy Mulligan, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, Christine McEvoy and Bert Hernandez.

In particular, I felt impelled to let you know that Bert Hernandez has been especially helpful in my endeavours. Bert and I spent many hours on the phone discussing TW's scheduling intricacies. He has been very patient with me and always made himself available to me to answer my questions. He was able to discuss in great detail many TW transactions, including why and how transactions appear the way they do, and what the transactional data means. He even went so far as to ask other departments for explanations as questions arose, rather than referring me to someone else, and never failed to follow-up on a question I had.

In short, I could not have made the progress I have without Bert's help.

The report is still being finalized, but Marketing and Gas Control have already employed the report with great success in managing Transwestern pipeline activities. Incremental gas sales deals were done in June and July utilizing information from the report, and the Commercial Support and Financial Accounting groups are looking at the report for ways to employ it in their work.

Again, I just wanted to pass along to you that your team was instrumental in the development of the report, and I wanted to give them the appropriate recognition. I thought I'd better send this now as opposed to waiting for PEP, lest I forget. I also believe that good news shouldn't wait. We don't always hear enough of it!

Thanks again!

	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles ""window"" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.

Subject:	RE: TAS Refund update

The SLA settlement is progressing more slowly than anticipated.  It now looks like we will be required to do a 4-6 month refund of Reservation & Commodity.  The latest estimate is that we wouldn't have FERC approval for revised rates pursuant to the SLA settlement until at least March.  Since the rates will be retroactive to November, 2001, we would have to refund both Res & Com for November, December, January and, at least Reservation for February.  This could become a rate-case sized refund effort.

(Linda, Ray & Wendy - While this doesn't affect you directly, it could affect your projects because of resource requirements from both IT and Gas Logistics. )

Importance:	High


Northern is close to a Settlement with our customers involving Carlton and the SLA.

This will entail some special invoice processing.

We expect to file revised Reservation, TI Commodity and Carlton surcharge rates to be effective November 1, 2001.

However, the filing probably won't be made before November 1 and we aren't likely to have approval until the end of the year.
That means that November will be billed at the existing winter rates and 
we will need to do a 1-month refund in January to rebill November at the new rates.

We hope to have approval in time to bill both Reservation & Commodity correctly for December.  But, on the Reservation invoice, we may need to do a late ""preliminary"" run to pick up new rates, depending on when we receive an order from FERC.

Lynn, currently the Bushton Imbalance through October 2001 reflects a volume of 76,862 MMBTUs and a dollar amount of $757,607.21 due Oneok (Oneok long to Northern).  Currently, the month to date volume for December shows Oneok short to Northern by 45,904 MMBTUs.  Continuing with this trend, Oneok will reduce the imbalance amount Northern owes them.
If you have any questions, please call me.

Will you have time for lunch or dinner while you're here?  Would be great to catch up.

Also, I heard some things mentioned that people might like to see in your followup:
Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Here are the stored procedures with their parameters in parenthesis.  Most of them are single selects and could be incorporated into SQL in the Excel add-in if desired.  I thought stored procedures would make it easier to separate support for the add-in from support for the code.  The stored procedures are all on the server ETSADHOC, database adhoctest, under my id (dpowell).  I think we want to get the DBA's to move these into a production environment so they are protected (ie: dbo in the etsadhoc database)?

"Demarc Allocation Conference Call - 11/06/01","	Greg, following are the questions you asked and my answers.  Please give me a call if you have
	any questions. (713-853-7637).  

	1.  Number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deferred get allocated during the same cycles as Demarc?

		Answer:  Yes

	2.   Seems unlikely since Demarc Deferred is a storage point and storage is allocated at a different time?

		Answer:  A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Deferred is a part of the Demarc allocation.  
			  When NNG looks at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals)
	 		  at the storage point.  The two referenced allocations are done seperately, but during the same
			  cycle.

	3.  If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deferred where would our customers pull from?

		Answer:  Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Deferred

	4.  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc or Demarc Deferred?

		Answer:  Demarc Deferred

	Hopefully this helped.  Thanks. Lynn

Tropical Storm Barry weakened overnight but still remains a tropical storm.

No, you are correct. In my haste to get something out to everyone I misstated the concensus of the group. Storage allocations will be the final process in the Timely cycle only.
Thanks for clarifying the point.

Subject:	Changes to Storage allocation and SBS

To summarize the outcome of the meeting this morning....
In the short term:
Storage allocations will continue to be the final process performed during the Timely and Evening cycles
Storage allocations will be before the Confirmation process for the Non-Grid, IntraDay1 and IntraDay 2 cycles / SBS will not be available during the Confirmation process for these cycles 
The changes will be made effective for the gad day of July 6th

For the longer term
Continue the above 
Make modifications to the storage allocatons program to allow SBS availability for storage activity which is the opposite to the activity being allocated (i.e., SBS storage withdrawals when storage injections are being allocated)

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

I guess what Lynn is trying to convey is that, for the Demarc allocation which is a ""group allocation"", the system looks at transportation paths from the field to demarc and Demarc deferred, but the allocation only looks the delivery side of the allocation to implement the allocation, it does not take into consideration the receipt side of the path into account for the allocation.

Thanks for the clarification.

On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
same cycle as Demarc?  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
storage is allocated at a different time? [Blair, Lynn]   Greg, if there is a transportation path from field to
demarc def, then the path is a part of the demarc allocation.  If there is a transportation path from field to demarc, then
	demarc to demarc def., the transportation path is considered in the demarc allocation, but the storage path
	will not be considered until the storage allocation.  
If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]   Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Def.
 The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarc def.

Rick and Lynn, 

A customer can access all of NNG accounting documents( all invoices and their supporting documents).  However, due to tighter security coding in Business Objects compare to Actuate, reports are now only viewable by one party, instead of two parties. For example, at a poi where there is an agent and an operator, the agent is only able to view the Measurement Info, Daily Volume Allocation and Allocation statements.   IT is researching a fix to a situation like this.

If you still would like to meet with me to explain further, give a demo (or have  lunch meeting with just the three of us!), let me know.

Rick and Lynn, 

I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.

During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.

See me if you have questions.

	I have reviewed to orders issued by FERC.  They state ""Pipelines acquiring upstream capacity without prior Commission approval will be ""at-risk"" for the cost of that capacity"".  This means that Northern will need to track both the costs and revenues associated with offsystem transactions.  We believe that in tracking the revenues we can track by contract.  

	Therefore, I believe in the meeting that if we needed to track these transactions Sue's group would maintain a manual spreadsheet for all off-system transactions.

	We also said Dan Fancler would need to review and determine how we would track the revenues thru the accounting side.

Subject:	Transok Offsystem Fuel Accounting Procedure

Based on our meeting 10/9/2001, I would like to propose the following accounting procedures for expensing in-kind fuel.

Case A:  In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem with only 486,000 dts expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.

Gas Accounting would reduce Offsystem inventory 14,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction in the same month the next NNG gas purchase transaction occurs (FIFO inventory method).  Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.  If the next gas purchase transaction occurs in December at $3.00 then we would reduce Offsystem Storage Inventory by 14,000 dts in December production.  December UAF would not be affected.

Recorded in December:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

Procedural Note:  All Third Party Offsystem storage statements must be forwarded to Gas Accounting (Dan Fancler) in order to reconcile the Physical to the Books.  Reconciling items such as in-kind fuel reductions will be reported to Storage Marketing noting that purchases for in-kind fuel replacements are needed.

If NNG purchases 100,000 dt for Operational Storage in December, then 14,000 dts would be carved out as in-kind fuel replacement and recorded to 858 (3rd party transport), the remaining 86,000 dts would be recorded as Operational Storage purchase and encroachment.  We may wish for the vender to issue two invoices.


Case B	 In October 500,000 dts moves offsystem, NNG purchases the in-kind replacement on Transok's system and 500,000  dts is expected to be returned to NNG in January.

NNG moves 500,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory. No accounting entry made to the G/L.
NNG does not reduce the offsystem physical inventory.

Recorded in month of purchase on Transok's system:
Debit 858 3rd Party Transport exp		14,000 * $3.00 = $42,000
	Credit A/P							($42,000)

In both cases all transactions are recorded outside of operational storage, but gives Marketing some flexibility on when the in-kind replacement takes place but still follows a logical methodology (FIFO replacement).

The South Central Team has discussed Debra's Corrective Action Report and feel that she has met the demands we placed on her at the time the report was issued.  We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year.  Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed.  We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. 

 Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. 

Thank you,

Lynn,

Trading gas for the first day of month is already a hectic if not absolutely crazy day.  Putting out the final posting of the fuel rates the day of trading is not acceptable.  Northern has one of the most complicated fuel matrices in the industry and expecting your customers to change those matrices the day of trading puts us in a very tough situation.  It will difficult at best to get you our nominations in a timely manner due to your decision.   Next time you decide to change fuel rates at least give us one day to implement the changes not two hours.

Subject:	FW: OneOk Talking Points

	Stan, the Bushton Team met yesterday and decided that there is no value and substantial risk to Northern in accepting OneOk's suggestion that we rewrite the Bushton Measurement Agreement to operate like the OneOk-Kinder Morgan Scott City measurement agreement.  We are reluctant to incorporate the PTR formula in any way beyond the limited purpose it serves under the current Measurement Agreement.  The following are talking points that Dave Neubauer will use today in a conversation with Terry Spencer, who is Steve Winston's boss.  Since Winston's proposal (which I sent to you by email last week) was a draft and has never been formally sent to us, we decided that having Dave deliver our message to Terry made more sense than sending a letter or elevating the issue to your and John Gibson's level.  However, if Gibson calls you and raises the issue of their proposal, the following points contain our message.  

	Spencer may agree in the call with Dave to reconcile the April and May imbalance based on our metered numbers.  If not, Britt has prepared a demand letter that can be sent at any time to get resolution of that issue rolling.  I believe that Gibson indicated that he'd be calling you back this week to talk about this matter, so your conversation should take place before we send the demand letter. I'll forward the demand letter for your review separately. 
 		
	On the other proposal from OneOk that I forwarded to you last week (relating to operational changes designed to allow OneOk to get the helium plant running again), we have made some minor modifications and are sending the counterproposal back to OneOk.  We expect to get that deal in place with them soon.  This is a good development for them, and with little or no risk to us, and should temper any disappointment they feel because of our rejection of their measurment proposal.   

	Please give me a call if you have any questions or concerns.  Thanks. DF



 

1.  Steve Winston's suggested approach is similar to ONEOK's Scott City measurement agreement with Kinder Morgan.  It uses PTR as an alternative form of measurement that takes precedence over the primary meters if the variation between the PTR and the primary meters exceeds certain thresholds.  That structure is very different from the Northern-ONEOK Measurement Procedures Agreement, which, as reaffirmed by the arbitrators, does not make the numbers from Northern's ultrasonic meters subject to ONEOK's PTR numbers except in the very narrow circumstance of a ""BTU measurement error"" (i.e., when the chromatograph malfunctions).   

2.  Northern is not willing to modify the existing agreement to elevate ONEOK's PTR to a status equal to the ultrasonic meters because the Oneok meters and processes within the plant have numerous deficiencies and do not conform to AGA quality specifications.  ONEOK's independent outside experts, Barnes and Click, confirmed this fact during the arbitration. 

3.  ONEOK can currently use PTR, or any other means it wants, to determine whether to call a ""special test"" of the accuracy of Northern's ultrasonic meters pursuant to Section 2(e) of the Measurement ProceduresAgreement.  Upon calling a special test, any concerns ONEOK may have about the accuracy of the ultrasonic meters would be resolved by independent technical analysis of the meters.  ONEOK has not called for a special test, but can do so at any time if it believes the ultrasonic meters are malfunctioning.

4.  If ONEOK wants to renegotiate the Measurement Procedures Agreement to track the structure of the Scott City procedure, ONEOK must bring its measurement and processes within the Bushton Plant up to AGA quality specifications and provide for maintenance of those meters consistent with those specifications.

5.  The current imbalance at the Plant is about $1.2 million owed to ONEOK, based on Northern's meters.  The outstanding imbalance situation at the Plant, which dates to April and May of this year, must be resolved irrespective of what ONEOK desires to do going forward.  Since ONEOK has not called a special test of Northern's meters, the arbitration award mandates that the metered data govern the imbalance for those months.  If ONEOK does not agree to that reconciliation, Northern will be forced to pursue appropriate remedies.

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Subject:	IDD/Park & Ride Transfer

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

Further, Alliant wants Gas Logistics to tag the PPA's.  Specifically, Alliant requested the differences are identified by gate and amount of change.  Is this possible?

Subject:	Intra-day 2 allocation on San Juan Lateral

Spoke to Lynn Blair, Kim Watson, Cynthia Rivers, Linda Ward, and Terry Kowalke, we would like to hold the same 
scheduled numbers on ID/2 from San Juan Lateral as we had scheduled for ID/1 from San Juan Lateral.  
We think this will help us minimize our Operator and Shipper imbalances.  
Please let us know if we start getting complaints from our customers.  
If anyone has other ideas or comments please let us know.

Example:

Non-Grid--    San Juan Scheduled      870,000
ID/1                                                                875,000
ID/2                                                                875,000 
(we will have to do the right mouse click and update the capacity to the flow rate needed.)

Subject:	Wire Transfer Processing

Treasury, SAP, and GCP have been working together for a number of months to resolve payment issues.  During this time, Treasury has been reviewing each wire transfer manually.  It is now time to move to the next step and allow our banking system to provide these edits and focus our attention on just the wires that fail the edits.

Treasury has partnered with GCP and SAP to quickly resolve any vendor master and data entry related issues.  This team will be working with business units as needed to expedite the correction and reprocessing of payments to meet the commercial needs of Enron.  We will need your cooperation to expedite the turn around on any items in your area.

More detailed resolution procedures will be developed next week and communicated to all of you.  

Thank you for your help in this process.

Mary Perkins

All,

The presentations have been posted to NNG's ""Download"" Site at <http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. ""Save target as""
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on ""save""

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

Thx,

Toby

Subject:	WTG and WTG Marketing



	Here is what I called about:   WTG is a small customer (Tariff Sheet No. 510) and are entitled to a 1000 MMBtu in tier one of their imbalance rather than the 3%.  However,  WTG Marketing actually was nominating on their own contract for WTG (small customer) and therefore was not receiving the small customer 1000 in tier one.  WTG  feels they were misled by Northern and thought they would receive the 1000 tier one because they were nominating to a small customer point.  If they would have understood that the 1000 Tier One was only applicable to the WTG's (small customer) contract. WTG Marketing would have nom'd as an agent on behalf of WTG (small customer) using WTG's (small customer) contract.

Okay here is the question:  Marketing and Gas Logistics is asking if they can retier retroactively to March 2001 up to current.  We have retiered for other reasons in the past due to our own measurement problems and this also appears to be Northern's ""mistake"" by providing misinformation.  What is your feel for this or  would be better to enter into a ""settlement"" with WTG Marketing so as not to set a precedent.  

Lynn or Janet,  feel free to straighten me out if I have the story confused.

We know that many of you have been severely impacted by Tropical Storm Allison and the devastating flood. Enron cares about you and your family and would like to make sure that your immediate needs are being met. 

To assist you, Enron is providing employees and contractors who have had their houses damaged with $1000 in travelers checks. To receive the checks, please come by EB1625 after 12 noon tomorrow, June 13.   Please be patient as we may temporarily run out of checks depending on the demand.

Please know that the paycheck you will receive on June 30th will be grossed up to account for the taxes that will be taken out if you are an employee. Also please know that you will be asked to sign a certification of your situation in order to receive the funds.

We hope that this helps you and your family. Our thoughts are with you.

Please call Misha Siegel at x37682 should you have any questions.

Lynn,

Do you think it's possible for Robert to attend the Winter Ops Meeting in
KC this September?

I think it would be very valuable for both Shawn Amaya and Robert to spend
time together at the meeting just as I found it very valuable when I was
the Operations Rep for NNG a few years ago.  Not only is the Ops Meeting
structured and informative, it is also a great way to improve current ties
and create new relationships.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

I am planning to attend the NNG Winter Ops Meeting the second week of
September as we discussed.  However, my NNG rep Robert Benningfield informs
me that he and other reps might not be allowed to attend.  This was the
same case as last year.  Since I interact with my reps on a daily basis,
they are the ones familiar with our business and our operational concerns.
I think that it would be beneficial to us for him and other reps to attend
as they would be able to provide insight to the proceedings as they pertain
to our business.  We are investing time and money to attend these meetings
each year.  I think we should make sure that we get the most return out of
them.  Let me know if you can contact your counterpart at NNG to voice our
interest?

Thanks.

Shawn

Before you write the request, please make these clarifications:

1. If we allocated during timely,  then don't allocate again during any intraday cycles,
    do we count that as being a day that was allocated ?
2. Ventura receipt and delivery are currently being allocated separately, and not netted against 
    each other like everything else.  Does it count if  either side got allocated ?
3. If a point is in a group that is being allocated, but the point itself is not, does it count ?
4. Percentages ?

Toby, does Northern track the number of days and associated percentages that a point is allocated during a heating season?  We are trying to do a transport deal and the customer asked how often we allocated POI 5532 (Eagle) and POI 192 (Ventura) last heating season.

Chris,

The tariff prohibits us from makeing transfers between storage points, not any NNG policies.   Are they making the nomination from Mid 17 to Demarc Storage on the timely process?  If they are, they should have been able to get injections, as we have not been allocating the timely process the last few days.

Subject:	IDD/Park & Ride Transfer

Earlier this month, Marketing entered into a negotiated rate deal with Kaztex for one day transport from Demarc to Eagle.  It was Kaztex's intention to withdraw the gas they had in their IDD/Park & Ride account to bring their balance down to zero.  The negotiated rate deal required extensive review and the customer was tendered the contract at 11:52 AM.  Market Services held open the window to accomodate their late nomination.

Herein lies the problem, the Kaztex scheduler withdrew the Park & Ride from the Demarc Storage Point because Demarc was their Primary Receipt Point on the transportat contract.   Instead, they should have withdrew from their Ogden and Mid 17 Storage balances.  To date, they have tried to nominate a transport from the Mid 17 and Ogden points to Demarc Storage but the Storage Nominations continue to be allocated.

I understand it is not Northern's policy to transfer storage between two points without a transportation transaction, however, I would request for this specific case Northern would administer a transfer thus preventing any possible MIC charges at the end of the month.  I estimate the transport revenue being waived to be approx. $44 (2345 MMBtu from Mid 17 Storage * $0.019 plus 720 MMBtu from Ogden at $0 cost).  The negotiated rate deal easily made up this amount.

If you agree with allowing the transfer of the storage balances, please let me know and I will alert the appropriate scheduler and Kaztex.

Thank you for your consideration.

Subject:	FW: SCG Advice 2837-A

After discussing with Lynn and Glen, we think that we would like to file comments in this proceeding concerning an issue we have had since this has been implemented on Nov 1.  In instances where SoCal happens to call their OFO in the Intraday 2 cycle, it can cause Transwestern to have Shipper imbalances because we do not have an opportunity to pass-along these reductions to our upstream parties.  We think we would like to file a letter that may mention our general support of the ""direction"" of SoCal's changes, but that we do have an issue that has developed since actual implementation that we are currently working on with them.  Lynn & I worked on this rough general description we thought could be incorporated into a brief letter.
	
		""If SoCal calls an OFO in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCal.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is unable to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.""

Lynn thinks if we are unable to resolve this issue with SoCal, TW could have high Shipper imbalance exposure.

Glen and Steve:
 
The attached supplemental advice filing by SoCalGas replaces the  changes to Rule 30, Transportation of Customer-Owned Gas, proposed by AL2837.   The purpose of this filing is to  describe the new internal receipt point operating procedures that SoCalGas is  implementing, and to request Commission authorization to include the revised  operating procedures in Rule 30. SoCalGas says this step is being taken in  anticipation that it will be replaced with a system of firm tradable intrastate  transmission rights in Gas Industry Restructuring (GIR) proceeding, I.99-07-003.  
During  the GIR panel hearings, several parties requested that SoCalGas publish its  windowing criteria in tariffs to facilitate a better understanding of the method  used to allocate receipt point  capacity.  SoCalGas agreed to make  such a filing, and D.99-07-015 directed SoCalGas to file an advice letter adding  windowing information to its tariffs.  To comply with this directive, on August  6, 1999, SoCalGas filed AL2837, which has not been acted on by the Commission.  
Customer complaints about SoCalGas' windowing  procedures have convinced SoCalGas that it should replace its internal  windowing operating procedures with a system that is open to the maximum  operating capacity at each SoCalGas receipt point.  SoCalGas is making these internal  operating changes effective November 1, 2001.  SoCalGas held meetings with upstream  pipelines on October 17, and with interested customers and stakeholders on  October 18, regarding the upcoming changes.  They were invited to ask any questions in  the days leading up to the meetings. 
Comments and/or protests are due on November 21.  Have a good  weekend!

Just to let you know that everything ran smoothly with ID#2 for 9/18 and the evening cycle for 9/19.  We had no problems with NBPL.

ANR's nom for 9/18 for Janesville was 107,917mmbtu and gas control asked them for a little extra gas.  The flow rate was between 113,000 - 115,000mmbtu.

No problem either with printing the ""scheduled volumes"" report from business objects for gas control.

I would think that it would be best to talk with (1) Joe Hartsoe in our DC office (Enron's P/L chief FERC regulatory guy) and either Becky Cantrell or Leslie Lawner from a shipper's perspective.  

Joe is in Houston every once in a while.  You may want to contact him directly.  Becky works from Houston.  Leslie has to come in from New Mexico.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.
---
In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

 Just a follow up on this issue. Most of the October PPAs have been processed with a few exceptions. Hopefully, all will be complete at the end of this week. We are still working on finding a way to systematically identify the late charts. I'll keep you advised of the progress on that front.
 Have a safe holiday !
Gary.

All of the MidAmerican corrections for October have been made with the exception of 0737181-01,0737021-01, & 0737021-02. The charts were never received form these locations. Dan Boswell has been out of the office due to his Father's death but should be back tomorrow. We'll get a handle on the other outstanding PPAs this week.

	Gary and Caroline, as of today, we have emailed a list by station (7 and/or 16 day charts) to the measurement
	group which needs to be read for PPA's to correct the daily volumes fro the following shippers:

		MidAmerican - 147 stations (It is my understanding you have already 44 of the 147)
		IES - 87 stations
		Interstate Power - 6 stations
		Wisconsin Power and Light - 11 stations

	In order for Gas Logistics to keep track of the ones that need to be corrected, we would like for Measurement to send 
	us updates on the following information ASAP:

		1.  Which station numbers have or have not been corrected for October.

		2.  How many October charts have been received and how many are outstanding

		3.  Provide status of November chart information.

	Gas Logistics needs the October corrections in the system by December 19th, which is the time
	frame for the first prior period run.  This is important for us to be able to review the prior period invoices.
	As you 	find there are missing charts, if we can be of assistance in calling the field, please let us know. 
	This way, the measurement group can concentrate on reading the charts.

	We appreciate your assistance and help in tracking these prior periods and helping each of us to keep focused
	to get these prior period corrections done by the next months billing.  If you have any questions, please let
	Rick or I know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	US Energy Carlton Request


As you know, USE is agent for a number of small Carlton sourcers.  They have contracted with a single supplier to bring gas in at Carlton for all of USE's clients.  USE wants to bring each shipper's Carlton obligation gas in on the shippers' individual contracts.  Normally, the supplier would have to confirm separate nominations for each little shipper.  Debbie Burgess at USE asked Diana Porter if there was a way that the USE Supplier could nominate the gas to a single USE contract at Carlton, then USE would nominate the Carlton gas from that contract to all the little Carlton sourcers for whom they are agent.

I talked with Steve & Dari.  They did not feel there was any tariff/legal obstacle to letting USE do this, as long as the contract
can only be used to facilitate the Carlton sourcing obligation.

I talked with Terry Kowalke & Gerry Medeles.  The simplest approach would seem to be an Administrative contract (non-revenue) where USE's supplier would nominate deliveries to the Admin contract and USE would nominate gas from the Admin contract to its clients' individual firm contracts.  

Based on those conversations, I told Debbie that it sounded like we could work something out.

Problem:  Later, Gerry Medeles determined that, because Carlton has special scheduling logic in TMS, 
it will require at least 2 weeks worth of system changes to accommodate US Energy's request.
With the current work load, Gerry didn't think IT could get the changes made by November 1 
but may have something in place for December.

Should we pursue?

Please check with the schedulers (if any) and determine if these contacts have been previously nominated upon.  Also, it is important that, if they nominate from this date forward, the activity is approved through Paul Cherry (may require pre-payment).  Thanks

Along with the timeline, describe the ""macro"" of how the pipe is scheduled/balanced and then go to the detail of how contracts and rate types stack up and get matched across the pipe with up/downstream.  Also when a delivery area is constrained and when a receipt area is constrained.  (pictures may help)

Another whole session could be devoted to the allocation at billing time -- least path, penalty application, etc.

Subject:	RE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues

I've talked with Vernon.  I can see Dari's point.  Since I will be out of town 12/11-12/12 when final allocated volumes come out, Vernon will work with Gas Logistics to do a Split Path manual, if necessary, to override the max overrun (OVA) rate with the firm rate.  When I get back, I will create tariff exception(s) reflecting the manuals to keep our records straight.  The MID-to-MID level tiered overrun discount will require manual review each month.  If shipper flows more than 5% overrun overall on any day, discounts may have to be entered at the path level to prevent discounting more overrun than the deal permits.

Affects 2 contracts: 108437 & 108489.  Tiered OVA discounts are currently entered on from several field MIDs to MID 16A, providing a discount on the first 1750/day on 108437 and 3675/day for 108489.
In practice, TAS will discount the first 1750 or 3675/day on each individual path.  If 108489 flows 3000 overrun on each of 2 different MID 1- to MID 16A paths in a day, TAS will apply the discount to a total overrun volume of 6000.

Another Question:  Vernon - Are you wanting to discount overrun equal to up to 5% of the contract MDQ on a daily basis, or on a monthly basis?  For example, on 108489, MDQ=73,500 so 5%=3675.  Is it your intention to discount only up to 3675 overrun each day, or would you discount up to 3675*30=110,250 Overrun for the month, regardless of daily flow levels?

Rita,

Not to complicate things, but, they have authorized overrun on thier contract for up to 5% of the MDQ at the contract rate (demand + commodity).  So there is a rate in the system for overrun as a tiered rate in the authorized overrun classification.

Subject:	RE: OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues
Importance:	High

Here are my 2 suggestions for the ONEOK dilemma

1) just discount Overrun down to max firm for the days when ONEOK nominated incorrectly and put an explanation of the circumstances in the Comment box.
2) I could create a Tariff Exception on the ONEOK contract for the days in question, setting the Overrun rate equal to the firm rate.  Then it would not look like a discount.  However, there is no way to attach a comment to an exception.

Considerations:
The Transactional report will not pick up a post-dated discount (but this isn't really a discount).
The discount (but not the exception) would show up on the 592 report - but nobody reads that, anyway.
When they nominated as max rate overrun, it got scheduled.  Since they had a right to firm service, they would have been scheduled if they had nominated correctly, so they didn't really get an unfair advantage over other TI.

Steve & Dari - what do you think?

Subject:	OneOk Field Services November Invoice Issues

Lynn,

Earlier this month, I noticed that OneOk Field Services incorrectly nominated 100% of their firm commodity as overrun.  I pointed this out to Joe Linhart and he got OneOk to correct it for the balance of the month.  Joe informed me that for the activity that had already been scheduled as overrun prior to that date couldn't be changed without a lot of work and it would be easier for me just to put in an overrun discount to get the invoice to come out correctly.  Since rates are directly linked to our publicly available FERC mandated reporting, I did not think that doctoring our rates would be the best solution either.  

Do you have an idea on another way to correct this or of the two options we have which do you think is the best way to correct this before the commodity invoices go out on the 10th?

Thanks!
Vernon

Subject:	Storage Allocations 

Gerry, 
This past weekend, specfically September 3rd,  storage injections during the ID2 process were allocated by approximately 130,000 MMBtu. The net storage injections at the end of the allocation was approximately 600,000 MMBtu. However, during the confirmation process certain deliveries, sourced with PNR withdrawals, were not confirmed by the downstream parties. The confirmation process resulted in cuts to PNR withdrawals that allowed net storage injections to be scheduled in excess of the 600,000 MMBtu capacity. The pipeline was able to absorb the extra gas this weekend but in the future NNG may not be as fortunate. 

Is there some way for the system to send out a notice whenever, after all the dust settles and the entire cycle is completed, the net scheduled storage activity exceeds storage capacity by a significant quantity? 

When you get a minute ...lets discuss.

Dale Ratliff is out of the office on vacation all next week & I wanted to help follow up on this item. I think for TW the posting it occurs after the cycle is complete. Rich  or Toby can  verify that for us. One thing that is different on TW, is our processis to confirm before we allocate. The allocation is the last process we do which produces our final or completed schedule volumes for each cycle.This is different than NNG which allocates then confirms. 

Also in you reference below that you need to know the schedule for posting Unsubscribed.  I want to make sure that this is correct or is it the operational available? I think the operational posting is what is scheduled after each cycle. 
Please let me know.

Subject:	Questions on MDQ 

	Ranelle, John and Michelle,  thought I would send this statement to you and see if this
	helps simplify our answer to your question.  

	The question is:  How is MDQ used in the nomination system to ensure we do not
	double up on MDQ volumes when we have split paths (i.e. nom on same contract
	from (1) Mid 15 to Bushton Inlet and from (2) Bushton Outlet to Demac)

	For Nominating purposes:

	MDQ of contract = Primary Firm + Alternate Firm up to the MDQ. 
	Anything over the MDQ will be Overrun and charged at the IT rate.

	Point MDQ needs to be considered when allocating a receipt point.

	EXAMPLE:

	If the Field MDQ is 10,000, then we will  (1) total the reciepts nominated on the
	contract; (2) compare the total nominated to the Contract MDQ.  Then the shipper
	will get firm (primary and alternate) up to their contract MDQ.  Anything over will be 
	overrun at IT rate.

	If anyone has any other questions, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

Subject:	Condensate Hauling

As most of you are now aware of, OneOk has hired a new trucking company to haul off the pipeline drips and condensate tanks at our locations where drip is contained in the southwest Kansas area.
There has been an appointment set to meet with this new trucking company representative on Monday, Sept. 24th at the Liberal Region office complex at 1:00 p.m.
The main focus will be for the teams involved to show the vendor where these locations are that have previously been picked up by WEGO, and to make arrangements for them to review previous schedules to haul these condensates. What they have requested from the teams are maps to each point along with driving directions that are specific to each location. It comes to my mind that maybe we could provide them with a copy of our emergency response driving directions that the teams should have on hand.
It was also brought to my attention, from my management, that this tasks needs to be handed off to the region operations management people so that they may coordinate the activities to their needs and schedules. It was also discussed that proper safety and procedure practices need be recognized by this new company which will be entering ETS facilities to provide their services for OneOk.
This would also be a prime opportunity to request that driver ""run tickets"" be left at all locations that drip is removed from. This would not only provide us with audit trail material for the future, but can give us documentation for comparisons at the places where we have load-out meters installed.
With these suggestions considered, maybe we can go forward from here with our continued services and work ethics with OneOk to provide a more positive customer relationship.
Thanks you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.

Below is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.  Of the $569,434.56 invoiced, $213,603.58 was through our capacity release program as the acquiring shipper for two Citizens Communications Company contracts.  Another $226,350.00 was for ENA acting as agent for Eastern New Mexico Gas Association, Enervest San Juan Operating, LLC, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  The remaining $129,480.98 is for their own contracts with TW.  Please see the attached schedule for the details.

Citizens is aware of their accountability for ultimate payment of the demand portion of the contracts in which they released capacity.

I finished development of a BusinessObjects Report to produce the NNG Bushton PVR information.  Today I turned this over to the Gas Logistics South End Team.  The report is available via the intranet web server Infosource.ets.enron.com.  I walked the team through the login process, refreshed and printed the report.  I plan to demonstrate how this report was built to the Gas Logistics report team being coordinated by Mike Bodnar.  I will do so at one of our earliest meetings.

I met with Donna this morning to talk about the budget.  I'm preparing a worksheet so that we can get all the changes straight.
If you'd like to meet with us I can let you know when I'll be there.  We don't have a firm time because I don't know how long this report will take.

Subject:	Mt. Jesus Condensate

Delaine,

The Operating Agreement between Northern and KN (now Oneok) entitles Oneok to all condensate and drip liquids removed from any of the Northern pipelines, equipment or facilities upstream of Oneok's Bushton Plant.  That agreement also provides that Oneok will be responsible for picking-up, hauling and providing a detailed accounting of such liquids removed.  In addition Oneok is to pay Northern for the shrinkage attributable to such condensate and drip.  Northern invoices Oneok monthly for a cash reimbursement of the mmbtu's attributable to the condensate removed.

Effective April 2000, Oneok began short paying its invoices.  The table below summarizes the amount shorted through April 2001 as $67, 889.36.  This short payment reflects Oneok's refusal to reimburse Northern for removal of condensate attributable to the Mount Jesus Drip, lease # 71176.  Oneok has indicated to Northern that Oneok's contract hauler contends the liquid removed from Northern's system at this point is water.  In spite of evidence provided by Northern to the contrary, Oneok accepts its contractor's contention, apparently pays a disposal fee, and refuses to reimburse Northern for the mmbtu's lost.  

This location produced condensate prior to the March 31, 1997 agreement and no change to Northern's pipeline operations that would impact condensation dropout has occurred.  Oneok was properly reimbursing Northern prior to April 2000.  In addition, the attached analysis of liquid removed from the location on September 20, 2000, demonstrates that hydrocarbon condensate continues to be collected at the drip.  Northern must insist that compensation for these BTU's removed from Northern's System be made by Oneok.  Your immediate attention to this matter is appreciated.

Thanks

Charlie

As you know, Sandy McCary assisted me in getting my daily spot file report and MIP reports posted to the Marketing Dashboard.  At the end of the month, I send the MIP files to about 12 people in Marketing Services. I am no longer e-mailing the report to people in Marketing, since most are using the dashboard.
They have indicated to me that they do not have access to the dashboard.  Do we need to get them access to the dashboard or should I continue e-mailing them the report at the end of each month?
Thanks,

Shelley, 

Per my conversation with Mary Kay, attached is a resume for Chris Miller.  I know Chris well and believe he has the strong communication skills, intellect and drive that it takes to contribute to the ETS team.  For these reasons, I would like to recommend Chris for a position within your group. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to discuss.  Thank you for your consideration.  See you soon!

Subject:	Oneok's OBA Balance Thru April 2001


Jerry,

Attached you will find the Oneok OBA spreadsheets which identify the cumulative OBA imbalance
through April 2001.  In order to balance to your monthly Confirmation Letter that Northern sends I 
have made some changes to the spreadsheets to make it easier for both of us to identify the 
cumulative imbalance by contract.

As per our phone conversation the Burdett (17378) point was sold to Golden Belt Transport, LLC, 
effective 2/1/01 but, the imbalance volumes are still being placed under your OBA contract.  I am
working with others here at Northern to get this corrected.

Currently I have identified that Oneok owns Northern $2,401,128.62 on all the OBA contracts 
(Ellis-Woodward-Clark OBA's=$316,846.96 due NNG; Delhi Beaver OBA=$171,781.26 due Oneok;
Orignial OBAs = $2,212,211.59 due NNG).  It was stated that both parties would cash-in/out the 
imbalances on the Original OBA contracts, on a quarterly basis.  At this time I am requesting that we
cash-in/out the Original OBA's and the Delhi Beaver OBA since, Oneok no longer operates the 
point.

Please take a moment and review the volumes and dollars on the spreadsheets.  If you have any
concerns please let me know but, if you are in agreement would you please let me know when 
Northern can expect to receive payment.

Lynn,
    The team has decided that we only need one primary evening person, which is Shirley Walden.  In the event that Shirley is out of the office, the team will use a rotational schedule between all team members to cover the evening shift.  I have attached a tentative schedule for evening coverage. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Mike,

Kent and Tim called me this morning and said that they have received a letter from LS Power requesting compensation for costs they feel they incurred to adjust their supply due to cuts on their FDD overrun.  Their analysis applies to the period June 1, 2001 to present.  Kent and Tim need data to perform an analysis that will be used to respond to LS Power's (USES) request.

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days. 
 Electronic copies of each of your final month end sum sheets for June forward.

They want to answer the customer within a week, so they'll need this information at least by early next week.  Kent has requested that all of the information be sent to both him and Tim.

Thanks for your help!

Kay

Lynn:

This is a busy place and I know you're quiet busy also.  Sometimes the only alternative to communications is emails.

I just wanted to get in touch with you and just let you know that this facility was finally sold.  The buyer is EOTT.  I have been offered a position with EOTT and their benefits seem to be comparable to Enron's however there are some changes.  After 19 years I hate to leave Enron, so I just wanted to see if you would keep me in mind if any positions become available.  Working in the scheduling and nominations area for you with NNG has been the most rewarding experience in my career and I would love to get back to an areas where I felt that I excelled.  I know that there has been some changes in the last few years, however, there is nothing holding me back at this time.   I certainly would have stayed if my family situation would not have been what it was 5 years ago.  I was not looking for a job, God just seemed to drop it down at  time that I needed to do something.  

Speaking of family, my daughter J'Nel has grown up to be a wonderful, beautiful, responsible and extremely lovable daughter.  We have become such great friends.  The adolescence years gave both of us some major growth in our lives for the best.  She is living in England right now, working and going to college.     I am very proud of her.

We are in a transition month, we become EOTT employees effective August 1.  I will try to touch base with you i the next couple of days.

Thanks for your consideration.

Nelda

Jo, you wanted me to get the Plainview South number from planning but see if the way I worded the reponse works.  I will get back to him separately on the fuel language response.

Thanks!

Subject:	PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Subject:	Changes to Operational Storage Capacity

It has come to my attention that changing the operational storage capacity between the Evening process and the NonGrid process can be unduly problematic for customers because most of the pipelines that interconnect with NNG do not recognize the NonGrid process. Such changes can lead to EPSQ issues during the ID1 process when shipper quantities cut during the NonGrid storage allocation end up being less than the EPSQ calculated for ID1. The differences that result will most probably end up as shipper imbalances on NNG. 
For this reason, it is strongly recommended that operational storage capacity not be changed between the Evening and the NonGrid processes in the future.

I have just spoken with Ms. Young in an attempt to
straighten out her bill.  Since they have not lived in
the house since the flood, I have agreed to have her
billing cycle stop effective July 1, 2001 until
further notice.  It is my understanding that she has
paid her June bill in full.
Somehow there was an error in turning her service back
on.  They are still not living in the house and don't
have a move in date at this time.  I have instructed
Hayes to turn off the service immediately and lock the
valve box until further notice.
I felt this was in the best interest of everyone
involved.  She is the only one that has requested
termination of her service from the floods and  I
don't feel that it is necessary to pursue this issue
further.
Shelly, please make a note of this action so that we
can keep all Board members abreast of this situation.
If there are any questions or comments, please call.
Thanks,
Richard

Subject:	RE: MOPS Operating Contract

Lynn,
All of our agent roles in the past have been to act as agent on NNG or TW for a customer not take nominations or do accounting as a third party pipe. TMS could probably be split out to take care of the nominations and confirmations but who's Tariff rules would it follow? if theirs TMS would have to be programmed for them, we would also need to duplicate a web site for postings. Confirmations up and down stream would not be much of a problem. Do you want IT to work up an estimate for the work and a timeline? I will talk to Donna about the fee associated with this role; she handled the Calpine agreement for TW which was different from the Northwest agreement. 
Let me know if you want me to procede.

Subject:	MOPS Operating Contract

Shelley/Lynn

As you know, we are getting fairly close to an understanding with Williams regarding NNG's MOPS assets.  As we continue to negotiate the PSA, one item has come up that we need your help with.  Williams has requested that we enter into an Operating Agreement with them to assure a continuity of service for the MOPS shippers.  They are concerned that the period of time from closing to them being able to incorporating the administrative functions into their back office systems may be disruptive.  They would like for us to continue to schedule the pipe, take the nominations, post information on the Bulletin Board, even submit invoices to the shippers, confirm with upstream and downstream parties, etc.... while they adapt their systems to these new assets.

I am assuming that once we close, we can no longer do these functions as NNG, but  would be acting as their agent.  It is still unclear which Williams entity will be acquiring the assets, so we still don't know which Tariff we would be working with. Can our systems segregate this administrative function from the rest of NNG to allow us to perform for a third party?  I don't anticipate more than a six month period of us performing these duties.  We will also need to develop a fee structure to assure all or expenses are recouped, and then add a reasonable surcharge (maybe 15%?).

They will also require Operational support, but the current contract between NNG and Enron Operations will be assigned to them.  

Thanks for your help.

Bob

There's got to be a way to pick it up since PNR parks (receipts) are picked up on the Market Summary.  Perhaps make purchases and sales pathed noms into a a purchase/sale point? Thanks for following up.

Rachel, the Market Summary report only picks up delivery quantities; therefore, it will pick up a sale of gas at a point in the supply area as this is a delivery out of linepack.  But, this report will not pick up a purchase in the supply area as a purchase registers as a receipt into the system.  This is why the purchase at Bridgeline Napoleonville (a receipt quantity) does not show up on the report.  We will need to see what we can do about that and get back with everyone.  I will talk with Larry Hill or Donna McGregor and let you know what we can do.  Thx, Jim

These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. ""Save target as""
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on ""save""

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for the  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to be the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns on this matter please let me know. Thank you. 

One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for all the individuals involved in this testing.

Terry Kowalke

Subject: Northern v. ONEOK/Proposed Letter to ONEOK re Fisher Roc


Everyone:
 
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
 
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
 
2.  We are missing an ""an"" in the first sentence, right before the word ""incident""; that will be corrected.
 
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
 
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
 
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
 
 6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
 
Many thanks.
 
Britt

Subject:	FYI - 637 Imbal Mtg

We held a meeting to discuss the status of TW's 637 Imbalance filing.  Our current position (after discussions about a month ago) has been that we are concerned about filing anything in the 637 docket because it would stir-up segmentation and for now we want to let that sleeping dog lie.  We discussed again the possibility of making a separate tariff filing to pursue our OBA ""wish list"" outside the 637 arena and decided again that this type of filing would just get consolidated with our pending 637 filing.

After further discussion we decided that the one thing, most narrowly defined, that would really help us out with our imbalances is mandatory cash-out in constrained areas.  If defined this narrowly, this is something for which we can clearly demonstrate an operational need based upon historical allocation and imbalance data.  We think that we could make a 30 day tariff filing for this one change and have minimum risk of entanglement with the overall 637 filing.

Glen & Mary are going to discuss with MKM and Teb with Rob.  Lyn & Terry are going to pull together the last 12 months of data for constrained areas on our pipe (Ignacio to Blanco, Blanco to Thoreau, Thoreau to the border & check with Darrell for any other areas that should be included) and increased imbalance levels.  We plan to get together next week to discuss further.

Concerning the rest of our OBA ""wish list"", we are discussing whether to hold meetings with individual protestors to discuss only the Imbalance issues of the filing and work toward a ""settlement"" position on those issues to have ready in the event of Commission action in this docket.

Chris,
Gary Anderson has implemented a change request for reporting volumes to the customer. The requested change would have the volume statements round the same as the daily extract files.
There won't be adjustments made for the June volumes, instead, when the change goes in, the volume statements in June will reflect the rounded volume.
I don't know the exact time estimate for this change but it won't be in before the July close. You will be hearing more about this in the future.
Thanks to ya'll for being so patient with us.
Jeff

Gary,
I hope I have stated this correctly and if you have any comments they would be greatly appreciated.

Jeff,

Last month  after our Commodity close NNG has had customers calling with differences in the volumes we reported verses the volumes that Gas Measurement reported for the month of June 2001.  I think you are aware there  is a rounding issue with the volumes due to the decimals in the new PGAS system.  I don't know if this problem has been resolved or not but since July's close is quickly approaching I was wondering if you could give me the status on this problem and also if there will be adjustments made to the June volumes in PGAS to reflect the same volumes that we reported to our Customers? We appreciate all the efforts that you and Gas Measurement have made to make this transition period as smooth as possible,  thanks  for your assistance and I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Chris Greaney

How hard would it be for someone in the logistics group to develop and distribute weekly a report on all of the NNG interconnects and the imbalances of all of the ones that we receive a report of the noms from scheduling.  I am talking about a report like TW gets from Richard Hanagriff that gives all of the imbalances.   This would help Gas Control to keep a better idea of where we are with the other companies.  I have had other gas controllers ask me this same question.  Thank you both for your time and trouble in looking into this for us.

Subject:	ETS' TW Teams Appreciation Luncheon - Last Round


Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

	Harry today received the original of the November 1 letter to him from Sherry Rogers, which, again, takes the position that we agreed to the use of Plant PTR for September because of our lack of a reply to date to their response letters to our notices of the two September measurement incidents, even though Northern clearly stated its position in Northern's notice letters.  However, the attachment to the original letter now includes the September 2001 imbalance statement, using plant PTR instead of Northern's meters.

	I will have this circulated to everyone by fax or hand-delivery.

		Ladies & Gentlemen:

		At Dave Neubauer's request, I am going to schedule a meeting for tomorrow to which you are all invited (and if I have left out a necessary participant, please let me know) to formulate a response to ONEOK's letter of October 16 to Dave (a copy of which I will circulate to you).  It has to do with the proposed special test.  I will have my a/a, Lee, circulate copies of (a) Dave's letter of October 5 and (b) ONEOK's reponse of October 16 to you all immediately.

		Given that so many schedules are involved, I went ahead and picked a time that both Drew and Dave have open: 4:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m tomorrow, Thursday, October 18.  Debbie has reserved the video conference rooms in 49C2 and in Omaha.  Lee will get a call-in conference number for anyone that can't attend in person, and e-mail it out to you.

		I appreciate your patience.	

		Many thanks.

		Britt

Just heard from Kurt -- he signed off on these a couple of weeks ago, and Sandy King advises these are set to be paid with the next run (12/23) SO, it appears we will be able to clear these invoices with no difficulty.

Lisa, per our telecon this morning, I left a voicemail for Kurt Batenhorst (BP Canada) to determine the status of the payments for the PPAs for December 2000 through April 2001.  Kurt is in Calgary this week and will be returning to the office on Monday, the 17th.

Will update as soon as I talk to him on Monday.  The total is $5,443.08.

"Hello Julia and Dave","It was good to get your note.  To answer your question, I had my last (hopefully)
surgery last Monday, June 18th.  Everything went well.  I should be back to
work on Tuesday, June 26th.  I was surprised I did not get postponed with the
flooding down in the Medical Center.  I stayed over one night and I was sure
ready to go home the next day.  I really felt for those nurses.  The hospital
(Diagnostic Hospital) was full to capacity since they were helping out the
Medthodist and Herman hospitals.  

Hope all your belongings in storage were OK.  I am so glad ya'll did not have
more damage than you did.  I talked to Ricki yesterday and she has people
starting to come in and redo the walls in her house this week.

I am so glad you told me about Steve Klimesh's mom.  I had not heard about that.
Do you by chance have his address.  I would like to send him a card.  I had lunch
with him right before he left and he was really looking forward to spending time with
his Mom.  

Speaking of parents, how are yours?  Hope they are both doing well.

As soon as Steve gets back we will email you and definitely go to lunch.

Take care of each other.  We sure miss you both.  Lynn

Subject:	Mauro Formaggio (Italian Energy Authority)

This is the schedule so far for Mr. Formaggio, who has asked to meet with someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (dispatching, the nomination and balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major aspects of third-party-access implementation, including OBAs with interconnecting pipelines).

He was scheduled to arrive this afternoon, and will be staying at the Hyatt Regency.  

Thursday, 8/23

9:00 through	Arrive at Enron.  He was given either Ginger Dernehl or myself as initial contacts.  
   Lunch	Advise John Buchanan of arrival (X.37429).  
	John will come to 47 to escort Mauro down to 41 for presentations by Lynn Blair and others about ETS gas logistics.
	Then Mauro will meet with Dannis Bellard for a tour of Gas Control.

3:30-4:30	Meet with Julie Gomez, VP of Long-Term Fundamentals-Gas


Friday, 8/24

I am trying to arrange a meeting also with George Smith, either at about 2:00 on Thursday or on Friday morning.  He is a manager in the EWS logistics area who could talk about pipeline operation from the shipper perspective.

"Team Shipper/Operator Assignments","	We have reviewed the assignments Jean sent out earlier in the week.  At this time
	I think the split is OK.  I would like for you to put in writing for me the following:

	 	Who is your back up on critical reports, etc when you are out.
		I would like for that back up to be someone that was NOT on
		your original team.  This may help us address the issue of the two
		""old"" teams merging.

		For example I am assuming if one rep has the shipper business and another rep has the
		operator business for the same company, then those two reps should back each other's
		desk.

		Randy Janzen is backing up Jean Adams desk on Lamar Power Plant since he has AEP which
			is shipper that does business at the Lamar Plant.

		Scott and Kathy support each other's desk since Kathy has ElPaso as a Shipper and
			Scott has ElPaso as Operator.

		Harry and Joe support each other on Oneok since Harry has Bushton and Joe has the
			gathering

		The areas of concern in relation to day to day business are below and need specific back up
		reps. 

			GPM Monthly Pricing Report
			Lamar Power Plant True Ups
			PVR Report
			Oneok Gathering Reporting
			NNG Administrative Contracts
			SPS Power Plant True Up
			Conoco Power Plant True Up
			MOPS Daily Report
				
		The HIgh profile shippers/Operators that need specific back ups are as follows:

			Duke/GPM
			Oneok
			Transcanada
			Dynegy
			Reliant
			ElPaso
			West Texas Gas 

	If there is any confusion with the email, please do not hesitate to call Terry or myself.  Thanks. Lynn

John, per your request price for front and back lamination is .70 cents for color copy and $20/ 1 hr. for lamination which is 50 copies per hour.
I was not able to get an exact price on mouse pad however I was given an estimate of $15 to $20 depending on amount ordered.  I have left a message for Karen in graphics and am waiting for reply.

This is to update you on what we are doing to correct the problems we have been experiencing at this point.  Penny McCarran and I have been working together to find a way to eliminate the DDVC's that are being created at this point.  This is such a small volume point (500 dth/day or less at present) being used for irrigation only and the shipper has no way of avoiding DDVC's since there is no storage arrangements in the Bushton Universe for them to make Final AM trueups and correct their volumes.  

We have worked with Contracts to determine if this point should truely be considered a TBS or Citygate.  EFM was installed due to possible volumes of approximately 1,700 dth per day and it was concluded that makes it a TBS.  Our findings, however, show that it does not meet the TBS criteria, due to the fact there is no LDC involved at this point. We have changed the type from TBS to IC and have created an OBA contract (pending signatures) to eliminate future DDVC's and make this a feasible point to operate.  

If you have any questions, please contact Penny or myself.

Randy Janzen

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Gary,  I received a call on 11/13 from Bill Lindley (Clayton Energy) agent for City of Hartley, IA.  Bill was inquiring about the actual daily volume allocations at POI 60551, Meter Number 722015-01.  He incurred about $5,503.35 in DDVC penalties for the month of Oct.  2001 due to daily variances at the TBS.  Bill was asking if the actuals were estimated from the 17th - 31st.  In checking with Frankie the end of the month index readings were used to estimate the volume due to the chart being received after close.  

Bill (Clayton Energy) has requested that we pull the chart(s) and check the reading to verify that the penalties and the daily volume are correct for the month of Oct..  Bill has provided me with the daily readings from his check meter at this TBS to compare with.  This check will determine if the daily volumes need to be reallocated and a PPA generated.  

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject: RE: Revised Sid Letter


Maria,
 
I think the revised paragraph focuses on the wrong point.   The lack of take-away capacity alone wouldn't make a firm customer prefer a volumetric rate.  It's the problem of not knowing from day to day whether such firm transportation will be confirmed at the border (i.e. the windowing procedure).  
 
My feeling is that the desire for a volumetric rate isn't driven by capacity, but by transactional uncertainty.  
 
I would suggest that we use the orginal paragraph -- but drop the discussion of takeaway capacity and focus on the window procedure.

	Here is what I called about:   WTG is a small customer (Tariff Sheet No. 510) and are entitled to a 1000 MMBtu in tier one of their imbalance rather than the 3%.  However,  WTG Marketing actually was nominating on their own contract for WTG (small customer) and therefore was not receiving the small customer 1000 in tier one.  WTG  feels they were misled by Northern and thought they would receive the 1000 tier one because they were nominating to a small customer point.  If they would have understood that the 1000 Tier One was only applicable to the WTG's (small customer) contract. WTG Marketing would have nom'd as an agent on behalf of WTG (small customer) using WTG's (small customer) contract.

Okay here is the question:  Marketing and Gas Logistics is asking if they can retier retroactively to March 2001 up to current.  We have retiered for other reasons in the past due to our own measurement problems and this also appears to be Northern's ""mistake"" by providing misinformation.  What is your feel for this or  would be better to enter into a ""settlement"" with WTG Marketing so as not to set a precedent.  

Lynn or Janet,  feel free to straighten me out if I have the story confused.

Subject: Aberdeen and Welcome

Lynn/Karen:
 
The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.  
 
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.  And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.  
 
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.   Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.  They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.  And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.   But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.  That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
 
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.  But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.  And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.  
 
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.  If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.  But that is as far as we are planning to go.   We view the flow restriction to be on your side.  And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st. 
 
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.  Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.  But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.  
 
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.  Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

Attached is the latest listing of Bushton Universe receipt points with their corresponding C6+ compositions.

		 

As you recall this list is to be used with the Bushton Procesing shut down plan to determine what receipts may have to be curtailed in the event of a shut down of the Bushton processing plant.  Eric Faucheaux is working with ETS Measurement Technology to set up a process to regularly update this list.  In the future these updates will not be emailed, but will be available on Optimization website, under Operating Guidelines.

I had reviewed with Jean the procedures for allocating the volumes using the required spreadsheet from Transok.  However, I did not have procedure for the allocation of
estimated volumes.  Upon requesting the spreadsheet from Transok for the current month, I learned that the spreadsheet would not be available until after our close.  At
this point, I  found that I was in need of Raetta's help to put in estimates.  To date, I have  received the current month spreadsheet from Transok which will require
PPAs,

I recommend this wording...

ETS is in the process of evaluating the feedback and system requests from the NNG Winter Operations meeting.  A system enhancement to notify shippers when they have nominated to an alternate receipt or delivery point that is not on their contract is on the list for consideration.  The requirements for this modification are currently being determined, however, the exact method and wording of the message has not been finalized.  It is anticipated that the enhancement will be installed in the first quarter of 2002.

Subject:	Major Opps on the savings plan!

Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was mentioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled.  I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; when I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had been canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the system when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stating that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price, what happened to the float?

I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as they see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reported and clarified.

Thanks in advance!

Subject:	Oneok Fined for Contempt by OCC Judge 

Oneok Fined for Contempt by OCC Judge 
An administrative law judge at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission last week found Oneok and two of its subsidiaries, Oklahoma Energy Marketing and Trading and Oneok Gas Storage, in contempt for their refusal to provide documentation of their gas sales. The judge recommended to the commission that the companies be fined $2,000 per day retroactive to May 8 and lasting until they comply with the commission order. 
Oneok and its subsidiaries claim the information is proprietary and that the commission has no legal right to have access to its unregulated gas sales transactions. The matter is expected to go before the full commission later this month. 
OCC Public Utility Division Director Ernest Johnson called the companies continued refusal to allow access to the documents ""mystifying."" 
""They have twice tried unsuccessfully to have the Oklahoma Supreme Court stop staff in its attempt to get the documents. Now they have simply refused to turn over the documents. A paid witness for Oneok recently testified that the dealings between Oneok subsidiaries and ONG were arms-length competitive transactions, and the resulting charges were fair, just, and reasonable. One would think Oneok would be anxious to show staff that such was actually the case, and that the decisions made were in the best interest of the consumer,"" said Johnson. 
""This is simply a case of commission staff trying to get the information needed to ascertain whether the customers of a regulated monopoly (ONG) paid a fair, just and reasonable price for their natural gas this past winter."" 
John said the commission staff received numerous complaints from gas customers struggling with high gas bills this past winter. They best illustrate the reason behind the staff's request for documents from companies owned by Oneok, the parent company of ONG, he said in an earlier statement. 
""It is the Commission's responsibility and obligation to review and determine whether ONG's customers are paying no more for gas than the law allows. Staff is simply trying to do that. It is regrettable Oneok apparently does not see fit to work cooperatively with OCC staff to strengthen the public's confidence in the utility and the regulatory process. Its refusal to turn over data related to gas transactions of its subsidiaries further undermines a public confidence already badly shaken by the gas crisis.""

Lynn, 

I talked with John Buchanan and we decided not to do the pop up notice for the new scheduled quantities report because we reserved that means of communication for instant critical notices.  So, we are going to send an email notice to all users using the email distribution list that we have for critical notices.  This email list should cover all active users whether they are online users or EDI users.  Also, I can put more info in an email notice.

"New Morning Meeting Report","Wanted to give everyone an update on the status of the new report format for the
morning meeting:

	The report is completed for all information except:

		Storage
		Operational Capacity
		Current and Accum Imbalances

The group working on this feels they will have all pieces of information 
available and the report completed by June 15, 2001.  The above referenced
fields have been a challenge to get  the data base populated as needed.  But this
group has done an excellent job in striving to give us an accurate report and not
giving up on possibilities.

As you are aware, Gary and Darrell have already started using the report
and we have changed how we report outages and allocations.  Storage will
change once the new report is completed.  

Don Powell and Dale Ratliff have been an excellent resource and very helpful to
ensure we get the product we need.  

If you have any other questions or any concerns about not getting the new
report before June 15th, please let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

I have just been informed that a wire from ONEOK was received yesterday for delinquent/disputed mmbtu reimbursement at the Mt. Jesus drip.  ONEOK had been withholding payment since April 2000.  The wire funds received not only included the $72,745.13 for April 2000 through June 2001 period  as requested in Dave Neubauer's September 24 letter, but also subsequently invoiced amounts for July and August 2001.  Looks like things are caught up and back on track.

I then asked Sherry Forbish if she knew anything about the bankrupcy filing.  Sherry had not heard anything and we called Tim Johanson.  Tim informed us that Rob Cooper of US Gypsum said the bankrupcy filing was to protect themselves from asbestos litigation.

As you know, Mountain Energy Corporation, a shipper on NNG, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  They have three small reservation invoices each month totaling together less than $2000 per month.  

Per Dari Dornan's instructions, I mailed them a certified letter to demonstrate creditworthiness on July 12.  Mountain (or someone) did receive the letter on July 18 and did not respond to Paul Cherry nor I by July 26, as stated in the letter.

Ranelle Paladino and Dari will working with Michele Winckowsi in Certificates to terminate these contracts.

Charlie sent me the following message.
""If the intent is to calculate the average between the two sets of numbers (NNG's vs ONEOK's) the ""settlement number"" would be 567,546.5!""
As the settlement document states that the blank number is what we are going to use for ""PTR"", I think Charlie is correct.  His number takes the average between the Plant PTR calculation and Northern's number.

Dari,

Listed below are the volumes from plant PTR and NNG calculated PTR based on inlet/outlet measurement for September 12 - 17.

I know this is trivial, but, I don't believe we can actually settle on a .5 MMBtu and enter a fractional volume into GVA or TAS.   I would suggest using 8,625.

From: 	ETS General Announcement/ET&S/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-ETS+20General+20Announcement_ET+26S_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Stan Horton, Chairman & CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Friday, July 13, 2001 1:15 AM
To:	Enron Transportation Services Everyone@ENRON
Subject:	Enron Cost Savings Guidelines


Effective, July 1, 2001, a number of measures and recommendations were implemented to reduce costs associated with travel, entertainment and professional services throughout Enron.  As ETS employees, it is our responsibility to follow the Enron-wide cost-savings guidelines below:

Travel and Business Expenses

?	Air Travel - Reducing air transportation costs is Enron's top priority.  Please take advantage of Enron's negotiated discounted airline fares by using ClickTrip, the Enron-managed online travel booking service, located at <http://clicktrip.enron.com/enron>.  Although use of Travel Agency in the Park (""TAP"") or the Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS)-approved preferred travel agency for your location are still available, ClickTrip is the tool we should all use.

ClickTrip provides employees easy access to all travel and pricing options for their destination (excluding proprietary carriers) and assists employees in making the most cost-effective travel decisions by providing the most current information.  In addition to bringing an estimated savings of 20%, ClickTrip is easy to use and is accessible 24 hours a day from any internet-enabled personal computer.  After-hours telephone support is also available.

When making travel reservations, please purchase non-refundable coach tickets when flying in the U.S., for these tickets can cost up to 65% less than refundable tickets and can usually be changed, if necessary, for a $100 fee.

?	Lodging and Car Rental - GSS has negotiated preferred rates at a number of worldwide hotel chains, as well as with National and Alamo car rental companies.  For more detailed information, please visit <http://travel.enron.com>.

?	On-line Expense Reporting - All requests for reimbursement of business-related expenses should be made through XMS, the new on-line expense account reporting tool.  Please access XMS at <http://xms.enron.com>.

?	Off-site Meetings - To schedule off-site meetings and events for more than 10 people, please contact Tracy Ramsey, GSS Director, Travel and Transportation Services Portfolio Team at (713) 646-8311.

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 646-8311.  


Professional Services

To better leverage Enron's purchasing power, all new professional service expenditure arrangements including legal, financial, accounting, engineering, information technology and others, and those due for renewal, must be negotiated through, or in consultation with, GSS.  Contracts for more than $5,000 must be pre-approved by both GSS and ETS. Prior to engaging GSS, please submit all service requisition forms to Rod Hayslett, Danny McCarty, Phil Lowry or me for business unit approval.  

To comply with the professional service procedure, a Professional Services Requisition form must be completed.  This requisition can be accessed on-line at <http://ibuyit.enron.com/gss/ibuyit/servicesprojectrequestform.xls>, or by contacting Ron L. Smith, GSS Director, Administrative and Indirect Services Portfolio Team at (713) 345-6329.
    
Additional information about Enron's cost-saving initiative will be on ETV, in eBiz and Enron Business, as well as in information booths in the Enron Building.

As we all work together to reduce costs across Enron, please forward additional cost-saving ideas to <recommendationsforcostsavings@enron.com>.  

If you have additional questions, please contact Derryl Cleaveland, GSS Senior Director of Operations, at (713) 646-7024.  

Stan

Alfredo --

I would think that it would be best to talk with (1) Joe Hartsoe in our DC office (Enron's P/L chief FERC regulatory guy) and either Becky Cantrell or Leslie Lawner from a shipper's perspective.  

Joe is in Houston every once in a while.  You may want to contact him directly.  Becky works from Houston.  Leslie has to come in from New Mexico.

Rick, as I mentioned to you last week, I would like you to help to organise the visit of two italian officials this summer. The first one is

- Mauro Formaggio (Director of Gas at the Italian Gas and Power Regulatory Authority)

I have a very good relationship with him and we have helped him in the past re. UK Gas Grid Code and other issues regarding gas TPA. He is now working on the TPA rules applicable to the Italian gas market, and he is asking if he could meet someone in Enron to understand more about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities). Please, see this e-mail below. He has not yet decided the dates, but he is aiming at last week of August, for 1/2 days. 

I would suggest you could put me in touch with someone in our organisation who could help on this, and I would co-ordinate Formaggio's meeting.


Alfredo,
I'm scheduling a visit to the USA on the practice of TPA. in the month
of August.
The aspects I'm considering are:
- how OBAs are organized and how they are applied,
- the operation of hubs,
- the balancing penalties,
- the trading of capacity
- the general operation of a (big) pipeline
- the general operation of a state pipeline, and of a LDC
- the operation of a shipper
Please let me know whether you deem it feasible also a meeting with your
american colleagues on any of these items.

In the meantime I have arranged for a visit to a major shipper and trader, in Atlanta (on the access as it is seen and done by a shipper, on many pipelines and storages), and to another major shipper and producer in Houston (on the relationship with FERC and other regulatory authorities, as well as on the access practice).
A visit to a major pipeline would fit well in this framework. To my opinion, Northern would be all right. It should act as a model to what could also be arranged, with time, by big transmission operator(s) in our country. It could refer to the dispatching operation, and to the commercial scheduling of transmission, to the nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as to the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities. If possible, two days would be a proper duration.
I think you can consider me a relatively well informed person, so there would be no need of formal presentations. The opportunity to see real operations and to discuss with experts would be all right. 
In the past, when I was in Snam, I took the opportunity of keeping in touch with the developments in the Usa. So, I already have a relatively good general knowledge of the american system. Last time was some years ago, when I visited Transcanada, in Calgary, for a week (focusing on nomination and balancing). Among the pipelines I visited in the course of earlier years, there were EL Paso, PG&E, Northwestern and also Northern for a short visit.
Going to Omaha would not be a problem for me.
As for the period, it would be in the second half of August (because with september there would be a very heavy workload to do, here in Milano).
Thank you and best regards
Mauro


Dear Alfredo,
I'm finalizig this week the program for a visit in the USA for and updte
on TPA practice, there.
Among of meetings I'm going to arrange, it would be of interest a visit
at a major pipeline.
Northern seems to me a good example. Would you envisage it as a possible
example for me?
I would discuss the organization of dispatching, see the nomination and
balancing operation, the allocation of measurement, and other major
aspects of TPA implementation (including OBAs with interconnecting
pipelines) for transmission and storage.
I'm considering the end of August for such a visit. Owing to the extent
of the subjects, maybe two days would be appropriate.
Thank you and best regards
Mauro

Lynn,

Just to let you know that one of the imbalances that kicked out I did figure it out(believe it or not);I have run nominated reports and scheduled quantities reports for all of Axia's contracts so that Kathy and myself can look at those on Monday to make sure everything looks alright.

The final for 10/27 I was able to figure out and everything was fine.  I will get this ""final"" down if it kills me!

Subject: Final AM Process for 10/26/01


John,
Karen asked me to send you a note about the problems we encountered 
with the final AM processing for 10/26.

When Karen submitted the rollover for the first time, it kicked out
two imbalances.  One, she was able to figure out with Kathy's help
and the other one she cannot.

The shipper on  K# 62418 nom 78172  at Demarc to K# 22252 during the ID2 cycle.
They were scheduled at 75177.
Shipper K# 22252 modified his gas from Demarc (from K#62418) to different storage.
However, he re-nom at the full 78172, not the amount that was scheduled from ID2,
which was 75177.  Shipper K# 62418 did not make any changes to this package.

If we just looked at the nom screen , everything is tied out.
However, we have to consider what's was scheduled.  In this case,
the scheduled number for K#62418 did not match the final am nomination
on K#22252.

After this transaction was invalidated (K#22252), the system
kicks out another imbalance, since K#22252 was realigning storage
gas to K# 22319, and we did not invalidate that change.

Karen also had some problems with not seeing the apply button.
I think Kathy walked her through the process since I did not.
We restarted the final AM process after the Timely allocation
and completed the cycle around 2pm.

Please call if you have questions/concerns.
Thanks,
Joe

UAT was completed today, 09/28/01.   

All accounting reports are now ready for migration to the Business Objects Production environment effective 10/01/01.
Note: 	Per discussions.....Please implement fix to resolve issue with the GISB Code hyperlink before 10/01/01 production date.

Beta testing also concluded on 09/28/01.   Feedback from all participating beta testers was received.  Also, there were four beta testers (shippers) who were willing to participate in the NNG Beta test.  (Utilicorp, U.S. Energy, Nebraska Public Gas, and Virginia Power)
  
In summary, the overall comments were positive and the general reaction of beta testers is that they were ""rather impressed with the progress that had been accomplished by NNG.""  Detailed customer comments by report type including any ""suggestions"" will be forthcoming.

Thanks.

The change has been implemented to drop the CURRENT day from the extract process. In this case, today is the 19th and there are NO daily records for the 19th in the file. Processing has just completed and this has been verified. Earlier today I contacted the oncall person for each company and let them know that the change had been implemeted and that no impact was expected to their processing. But, just in case, if there was a problem it may be associated with this change. I have no doubt that if there is a problem, everyone has my number. It's like an old worn out shoe.

A representative with Cedar Falls Utility contacted the NNG measurement desk about volumes for the current gas day changing on the Operator Confirmation Summary.
 
Issue:
 
The daily PGas extract is including partial volume with an Incomplete flag for the current gas day (not closed).  The MIPS extract did not process current gas day volumes.  The Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS displays the incomplete volume to the TMS scheduler and to external customers thus impacting the imbalance calculation.
 
Possible Solution:
1.	Hold the data pole file until gas day is complete
2.	Modify downstream system to process the incomplete flag to ignore current day volumes 
3.	Modify the PGas extract so that current day volume will not be included.

Solution:
 
PGas IT staff will modify the PGas extract so that current day (non closed) volumes will no longer be included in the file.  This will make the extract identical to the MIPS daily extract file it replaces.  TMS IT staff will modify the Operator Confirmation Summary in TMS to display the flow codes included in the extract.  The flow codes are as follows:
 
Blank     = Complete record
I             = Incomplete record
*             = Complete but edited record
 
Mike Sullivan with provide a work plan and implantation date.  If you have any question call me at 713-853-1534.

The following questions are ""possibles"" to answer for the FAQ area within HotTap?  


Why are there cuts on the final AM cycle that were not there for ID2?  

How does NNG allocate through the pools during a point allocation?
  
Does TMS look through the pools to the take away contract?

Storage allocations - I cannot find a specific question

Subject:	Williams Visit

Lynn,

I got a call from Dan McVay, the senior commercial guy at Williams Field Service this evening, and he relayed a request from his scheduling group in Tulsa.  They would like to visit with the team involved with the scheduling and nomination process for MOPS on Monday, Oct 22nd., probably most the day  This is in anticipation of their assuming responsibilities for the system.  They would like to observe the process and the procedures we go through everyday to administer the pipe. They will still require an interim period whereby we provide these services for them until they modify their computer systems, but this visit will allow them to qualify the task that they need to capture, and let them see what system changes they will need.

Thanks, 

Bob

Subject:	Transwestern Capacity Release Report - 9/2001

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides information for September 2001 invoicing.  The spreads to the California border narrowed during the month of September.  Therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by PG&E (Core) are below TW's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate.
TW Schedulers - I have left a copy of the flash invoices (processed as of late Friday) for all capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts in Amy's chair for your final disposition.  I have flagged all which may require some additional review/correction on your part.  I will be on a flight out Monday lunchtime for customer training and will not be back in the office until Thursday.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me by pager (800-718-0830).

    The team has decided that we only need one primary evening person, which is Shirley Walden.  In the event that Shirley is out of the office, the team will use a rotational schedule between all team members to cover the evening shift.  I have attached a tentative schedule for evening coverage. If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:	Transwestern's Reporting Requirements under FERC Order on Reporting CA gas sales


Per the Commission's order yesterday, Transwestern will be required to submit daily transportation activity (nominated, scheduled & delivered), capacity release activity and capacity beginning August 1, 2001.  The information will be submitted 30 days after the close of a month -- meaning that our first report will be due September 30.  The order does not specify when the historical capacity information for May 1999 and May 2000 needs to be submitted -- so at this point I'm assuming that it will submitted with the first report.

I would like to have a brief get-together tomorrow at 10:30 AM (Ricki will follow with details) just to make certain that we head into the month collecting all the information we need to be compliant.  In particular, now that we will have to report nominated vs. scheduled to the Cal. border each day -- I have an even heightened concern that we head into the month making sure that we capture the SoCal Window number each day.

Don,
Last week we talked about the Net IDD number displayed on the referenced report and the benefits of displaying the Net PNR activity separately from Net Packet activity. As a follow-up to that conversation I was able to confirm that the Service Sub Type in CMS was used to differentiate PNR contracts from Packets agreements in TMS.
PNR has No Contract ""Service Sub Type""
Packets have a Service Sub Type of ""A"" (Seasonal), ""B"" (Backdraft) or ""U"" (Other). The Packet activity can be combined and reported as one number. 
In addition, I have asked Contracts to establish Service Sub Types of Traditional, Non Traditional, and Storage for Service Type: SBA Pack/Draft so that Pack & Draft activity can be reported separately from the other activity. It is my  recommendation that the SBA line on the subject report be changed to report Peak activity (Service Type: SBA Winter Peaking) separately from Traditional Pack/Draft. The Non Traditional and Storage Pack/Draft should be used in calculating the Unanticipated Swing but should not be displayed on the report.
If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please call me

Jason/Hilllary/Marc/Mark/Stacy:
Please mark this time on your calendar so we all know how this is going to work.

Vernon:
Please be prepared to discuss:
   How we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us?
   Beatrice fits into the picture and if this is going to cause additional
   allocations.
   If Demarc gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not adjust
   our nominations
   If this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the field
   zone so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have the
   same problem as described above.
   Review the amount of capacity to and through Demarc by line.
   Specific example that includes all the cycles.
   Can you have an allocation after the timely cycle?
   Our priority going to Demarc from the Field if we have our nominations in on
   time and do not change them.
   What would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed to
   Demarc and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool
