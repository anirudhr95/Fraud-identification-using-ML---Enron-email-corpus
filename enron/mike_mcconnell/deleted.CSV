Here is some useful information on Anthrax that was sent to Conoco employees
by Conoco's Corporate Security.  Please post or forward as needed.

 
> ANTHRAX INFORMATION FOR EMPLOYEES
> 
> Corporate Security is aware of the media reports of Anthrax mailings and
> everyone's heightened concern of a possible contamination at Conoco.  We
> have maintained contact with the FBI, Hazmat officials and other
> government agencies regarding the investigations about, and the risk of
> contracting Anthrax as a result of receiving a letter.  With the
> heightened concern we all need to become better educated about Anthrax and
> deal with it on a rational level rather than an emotional one.  We have
> evaluated the available information and intelligence and believe the risk
> of an Anthrax exposure at Conoco is low at the present time.
>  
> Most reported instances of letters containing alleged Anthrax and powdery
> substances have proven to be hoaxes.  At this time all of the confirmed
> cases, except one, have been directed at the news media and U. S.
> Government officials.
>  
> Procedures are being furnished Conoco mailrooms regarding screening of
> mail and packages prior to distributions. However, so everyone is educated
> regarding Anthrax and handling pieces of mail, we are furnishing the below
> information:
>  
>  
> FACTS ABOUT ANTHRAX
>  
> Anthrax is a small invisible organism that cannot be seen by the naked
> eye.  To effectively target an individual in a letter, the Anthrax must be
> mixed with a powdery medium and placed in the letter.  It then becomes a
> visible substance resembling a brownish or white powder and will
> immediately settle to the ground.  The Anthrax must be effectively
> dispersed and the victim must be exposed to a relatively large amount of
> Anthrax to become infected.  Fortunately, Anthrax can be washed off with
> soap and water after handling.  Anthrax is not contagious; there is no
> threat of person-to-person transmittal.  If someone is exposed to Anthrax,
> it is treatable with antibiotics.  
>  
> Over 95% of Anthrax cases occur when spores linger on the skin in cuts or
> scratches.  Anthrax cannot penetrate intact skin. Exposure causes lesions
> that initially resemble an insect bite which progresses into a
> fluid-filled blister within a day or two with swelling at the site of the
> infection.  The blister forms a black scab. Twenty percent of the time
> individuals who develop skin lesions may progress onto developing wide
> spread disease which requires immediate treatment.
>  
> The second method of obtaining Anthrax poisoning is through ingestion.
> Gastrointestinal Anthrax is extremely rare in humans and is usually
> contracted when undercooked infected meat is eaten.  The initial signs of
> gastrointestinal Anthrax are nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting and fever.
> This may be followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood and severe
> diarrhea.
>  
> The third method is inhalation of Anthrax spores.  The onset of inhalation
> of Anthrax is gradual after a short incubation period, which is usually
> within seven days (in rare cases it is sometimes longer).  The victim may
> initially experience flu like symptoms that start to improve.  This mild
> illness can then progress rapidly to respiratory distress and shock in two
> to four days followed by more severe symptoms that include breathing
> difficulty and exhaustion.
>  If you have had a ""Known"" exposure you should seek medical care for
> monitoring and potentially for treatment if indicated.  If you have had a
> ""possible"" exposure and are having symptoms, you should seek medical
> evaluation and treatment through your personal physician.  If you do not
> have a personal physician IHS can help direct you to appropriate care.
> It is difficult to contract inhalation Anthrax by the mere act of opening
> an envelope or package containing a suspected agent or walking through
> settled material.  This would generally not provide the energy required to
> aerosolize the agent.  The FBI has advised that ""hundreds"" of letters have
> been referred to them because they were suspected of containing Anthrax.
> So far, of all the letters referred to the FBI, very few have contained
> Anthrax.  Most letters implying they contain Anthrax will also contain a
> written or implied threat.  As of this date, there is no evidence that any
> such letters have ever been directed at anyone at Conoco.
>  
> HOW TO HANDLE SUSPECTED ANTHRAX AND OTHER SUSPECTED BIOLOGICAL AGENT
> THREATS
>  
> Many facilities in communities around the country have received Anthrax
> threat letters. Most were empty envelopes; some have contained powdery
> substances most have proved negative for Anthrax. The purpose of these
> guidelines is to recommend procedures for handling letters suspected of
> containing Anthrax.  
>  
> DO NOT PANIC
>  
> 1.	To infect, the organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed,
> or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist. Disease can be prevented after
> exposure to the Anthrax spores by early treatment with the appropriate
> antibiotics. Anthrax is not spread from one person to another person.
> 2.	For Anthrax to be effective as a covert agent, it must be
> aerosolized into very small particles. This is difficult to do, and
> requires a great deal of technical skill and special equipment. If these
> small particles are inhaled, life-threatening lung infection can occur,
> but prompt recognition and treatment are effective.
>  
> SUSPICIOUS UNOPENED LETTER OR PACKAGE MARKED WITH THREATENING
> MESSAGE SUCH AS ""ANTHRAX"":
>  
> 1.	Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or
> package.
> 2.	PLACE the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of
> container to prevent leakage of contents.
> 3.	If you do not have any container, then COVER the envelope or package
> with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove
> this cover.
> 4.	Then LEAVE the room and CLOSE the door, or section off the area to
> prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
> 5.	WASH your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder
> to your face.
> 6.	What to do next...
> *If you are at HOME, then report the incident to local police.
> *If you are at WORK, then report the incident to security or an available
> supervisor.
> 7.	LIST all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious
> letter or package was recognized. Give a copy of this list to security,
> the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for
> follow-up investigations and advice.
>  
> ENVELOPE WITH POWDER AND POWDER SPILLS OUT ONTO SURFACE:
>  
> 1.	DO NOT try to CLEAN UP the powder. COVER the spilled contents
> immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do
> not remove this cover!
> 2.	Then LEAVE the room and CLOSE the door, or section off the area to
> prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
> 3.	WASH your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder
> to your face.
> 4.	What to do next...
> *If you are at HOME, then report the incident to local police.
> *If you are at WORK, then report the incident to security or an available
> supervisor.
> 5.	REMOVE heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place
> in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed. This
> clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper
> handling.
> 6.	SHOWER with soap and water as soon as possible. Do Not Use Bleach Or
> Other Disinfectant On Your Skin.
> 7.	If possible, list all people who were in the room or area,
> especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give a copy of
> this list to security, the local public health authorities so that proper
> instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement
> officials for further investigation. 
> 8.	If prescribed medication by medical personnel, take it until
> otherwise instructed or it runs out. 
>  
> HOW TO IDENTIFY SUSPICIOUS PACKAGES AND LETTERS
>  
> The U. S. Postal Inspection Service has provided information about letters
> and packages that ought to trigger suspicion.  This include parcels that:
>  
> *	Are unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you. 
> *	Excessive postage (Using postage stamps not meter strips) 
> *	Sloppy or unprofessional preparation. 
> *	Incorrect titles 
> *	Titles but no names 
> *	Sloshing sounds, possibly liquid contents 
> *	Excessive wrapping materials, such as masking tape, strapping tape
> or string. 
> *	Are addressed to someone no longer with your organization or are
> otherwise outdated. 
> *	Have no return address, or have one that can't be verified as
> legitimate. 
> *	Are of unusual weight, given their size, or are lopsided or oddly
> shaped. 
> *	Are marked with restrictive endorsements, such as ""Personal"" or
> ""Confidential."" 
> *	Show a city or state in the postmark that doesn't match the return
> address. 
> *	Have protruding wires, strange odors or stains. 
> *	Handwritten or poorly typed addresses 
> *	Misspellings of common words 
> *	Oily stains, discolorations or odor 
> 
> None of these indicators, standing alone, can identify a suspect package
> that contains Anthrax.  All known relevant facts must be taken into
> consideration to properly evaluate the situation. 
> 
> We have been advised that the FBI has made the following response
> recommendations to Local Law Enforcement:
> 
> Unopened letters/packages with no suspicious markings or indicators:  
> No law enforcement/emergency response action is recommended.  Recipients
> of the letter/package may be advised that if they are concerned about
> opening a piece of mail, they should not do so.
> 
> Opened letters/packages with material that has spilled out:  
> Law enforcement should follow local response protocols for potential
> hazardous materials.  The local FBI office should be notified and can
> coordinate a threat assessment and technical assistance/advice as needed.
> 
> 
> Unopened (sealed) letters/packages with suspicious markings or indicators:
> 
> Law enforcement should follow local protocols for responding to the
> location and collecting the suspect mail.
> 
> As additional information comes available, it will be communicated.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:

school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business

participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Subscriber Plus update.

National championship hopes ended well before loss to OSU

by Al Eschbach

You can mark down the date of Oct. 27 as the day Oklahoma lost its chance to
repeat as national champions. That was the day OU had its winning streak
broken by Nebraska. The loss to the Huskers wasn't what killed OU's hopes of
repeating as national champions, it was the season ending injury to Jason
White.

Without White at quarterback, the Sooners had no chance. What happened to OU
on Saturday against Oklahoma State shouldn't be that much of a surprise.
This offense has stalled many times with Nate Hybl at quarterback.

You need to look no further than the Texas game. OU doesn't win the Red
River Shootout if White doesn't replace the injured Hybl. The offense was
going absolutely no where against a bad Kansas defense the next week in
Lawrence. White came in and once again showed he was a play maker. After
White was hurt against the Cornhuskers, Hybl finished off the drive with a
short touchdown pass. Following that play, OU failed to score a point
against a suspect Nebraska defense.

There were struggles in the first quarter against a horrendous Tulsa
defense. The same could be said about Texas A&M and Texas Tech, Hybl never
looked good in the early going in all of those games. Against Oklahoma State
he looked nervous for four quarters. He was outplayed by a true freshman,
Josh Fields.

Sometimes when you lose you get a wakeup call. This offense struggled late
last year. But when you win a national championship you don't think there is
a problem. When you lose to a 3-and-7 Oklahoma State team, you know there's
a problem.

The Sooners have to find a way to be balanced. Zero yards rushing against
that weak Oklahoma State defense is as embarrassing as it gets. This offense
has to be retooled. You can't win championships if you can't pass the ball.
And you certainly can't win them if you can't run.

This year there was a quarterback controversy. Early in the year Hybl was
given the job. That was a mistake. Maybe the only mistake Stoops has made in
three years since he's been at OU. After the bowl game is over this year,
the Sooners need to make it clear that White is the man next season. They
also need to allow heralded freshman Brent Rawls to battle Hybl for the
backup spot.

And something an OU coach reminded me of this year about the offense. This
unit never did have a lead.

November 24 was one of the worst days in OU football history. But the reason
the Sooners lost the game was because of what happened on Oct. 27.

"Thanksgiving Holiday","

As we approach the Thanksgiving Holiday, I want to take this opportunity to
wish you and yours a safe and happy Holiday.


With the recent events in our nation, giving thanks this year has taken on
a whole new meaning.  This Thanksgiving we honor the brave, enduring heroes
who gave their lives as well as those who are abroad fighting for freedom.
We can be thankful for our great nation and for the world coming together.


I recognize that here at Enron we are working through some challenging
times and that everyone in the organization is working hard.  Thank you for
your continued dedication.


Please take some time over the Holiday to enjoy your family and friends.


Happy Thanksgiving.


Stan

The following 2 scenarios were run and meet our return requirements.
The total volume of 306 comes from the 240 suggested starting volumes
and the additional volumes come from expiring El Paso/MGI transportation
agreements.

_______________________________

1)  306 total volume

*	240 @ $.2479 for yrs 1-15
*	26 @ $.2479 for yrs 3-15
*	40 @ $.2479 for yrs 4-15

2)  306 total volume

*	240 @ $.2600 for yrs 1-15
*	26 @ $.1883 for yrs 3-15
*	40 @ $.1883 for yrs 4-15
_______________________________


We would suggest Showing PEMEX either scenario but using the round
numbers of $.25 (instead of $.2479) for scenario 1 and $.19 (instead of
$.1883) for scenario 2.

Please let me know if you have a preference.  We would like to fax one
of these scenarios to Jorge @ 3:00 today so that they can digest it and
use it for a starting point for tomorrow's meeting.

Call me if you have any questions.

Glad to hear it.  I was out all last week also.

By the way, is Sarah still making those wonderful cookies with all the
""goodies"" in them?  The one that is the ""family recipe""?  I was talking to
a girl at Koch today who said somebody brought in some cookies that had
Snickers bars in them and it made me think of those cookies that Sarah used
to make for us.  And then you sent me an e-mail..........we must be on the
same wavelength!  Anyway, I'm catching up also........working for a living

Debbie,

I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.

Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).  A bit
sad for a lot of other people around here.

As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.

"RE: WOW","I really can't believe things happened the way they did.  I thought everything was set for you guys to get another opportunity for the national championship.  I also thought the case for Roy Williams to win the Heisman would become really strong.  I didn't get to watch the OU-OSU game, but I received about 30 phone calls the last two minutes of the game.

I am excited that some breaks have gone our way, but it will be difficult to beat CU twice in one season.  Also, I am not sure that I want to ever play Miami after seeing them the last two weeks.

Don't be too upset, you guys are going to be tough next year and you are riding a two year win streak on us right now....(11-0 would sound a lot better than 10-1).

I'll be heading to Dallas early Saturday morning.  

Take care,
Zac

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.

Politics this week
October 18th 2001
From The Economist print edition 



The war continues
	
		
	
	
	

 EPA <http://www.economist.com/images/20011020/4201WW1.jpg>America continued its military action against Afghanistan using bombers and AC-130 gunships which can be used against ground troops gathered in small numbers. Observers said that this suggested that use of America's own ground forces was imminent.

See article: Nation-bruising, nation-building <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31020_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_32>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The Taliban seized two UN warehouses with more than half the World Food Programme's aid for Afghanistan. One was restored to UN control the next day.

Panic swept America after a letter containing anthrax was sent to Tom Daschle, the Democratic leader of the Senate (the third confirmed incident of anthrax by post); more than 30 people in Mr Daschle's office tested positive for exposure to the bacterium. The House of Representatives will close for nearly a week for a security sweep. The FBI said it had had some 3,000 false anthrax alarms. Elsewhere, Kenya reported receipt of at least one letter contaminated with anthrax.

See article: Anthrax isn't contagious; anxiety is <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31019_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_3a>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Bayer undertook to triple production of Cipro, the only antibiotic approved for the treatment of anthrax. Tommy Thompson, America's health and human services secretary, declared that he would seek funds to lay in enough supplies to treat 12m people for 60 days.

The outcome of the Democratic primary in New York city was put in doubt after a recount was ordered. The race had appeared to be won by Mark Green, the city's public advocate. His rival for the nomination, Fernando Ferrer, has retracted his concession.

See article: To run is to lose <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31018_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_39>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Cuba reacted angrily to Russia's announcement that it will close its remaining spy-base on the Caribbean island, saying no agreement had been reached. The Cubans accused President Vladimir Putin of wanting to give ""a special present"" to George Bush, his new-found ally against terrorism.

Mike Harris, the powerful premier of Ontario, Canada's biggest province, resigned.

Fed up with a long recession and threats of budget-balancing austerity, Argentina's voters gave their Alliance government a walloping in congressional elections.

See article: Calling for change-but in which direction? <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31017_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_38> 

Australia said it would send 1,550 troops, along with military hardware, to join the American operation in Afghanistan.


Assassination in Israel

	
	 EPA <http://www.economist.com/images/20011020/4201WW2.jpg>	
	
	
	

Rehavam Zeevi, Israel's far-right minister of tourism, was assassinated by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in revenge for the earlier killing of the group's leader. Ariel Sharon said he held Yasser Arafat responsible, though the Palestinian Authority was quick to condemn the killing and arrested several PFLP men. Six of Mr Zeevi's right-wing colleagues, who with him had been at the point of resigning from the governing coalition, said they would give Mr Sharon a chance to show toughness.

See article: Which way will Ariel Sharon go now? <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31016_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_37>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak ordered that 170 suspected Islamic militants, who had long been held without trial, should go before a military court at once.

Police in Malawi arrested a leading opposition politician on charges of treason relating to a failed coup. Brown Mpinganjira was a founding member of President Bakili Muluzi's ruling party, but formed his own party, the National Democratic Alliance, partly to oppose the president's efforts to win a third term in office.

A report on mortality rates revealing that AIDS is the biggest killer in South Africa was finally released. The government had delayed publication of the Medical Research Council's report, while the official statistics agency sought to pick holes in its findings.


Re-starting Europe's heart

Governments in both France and Germany started to revise plans to pep up their slowing economies. Leaks from Germany's finance ministry revealed that estimated GDP growth for next year is now 1.5%, down from a previous official guess of 2.25%. Laurent Fabius,France's finance minister, proposed a budget for next year that would double tax-credits for the low paid and give help to investors.

Tensions between France's Socialist-led government and its conservative president rose with the publication of a ""tell all"" book by Olivier Schrameck, the prime minister's closest aide.

In Italy, conflicting attitudes to America's bombing of Afghanistan threw the opposition on the left into disarray. The main ex-Communist party and the centre-left alliance's current leader, Francesco Rutelli, were in favour, but two still-Communist parties, the Greens and some centre-left Christian Democrats were against.

Tension rose in Georgia and its Russian-backed breakaway statelet, Abkhazia, where skirmishes continued and Chechens helped the Georgians. Meanwhile, over Chechnya itself, Russians and Chechens were said to be putting out peace feelers through intermediaries.

See article: Dangerous relations <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31022_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_34> 

	
	 AP <http://www.economist.com/images/20011020/4201WW3.jpg>	
	
	
	

Greece's centre-left prime minister, Costas Simitis, was re-elected as leader of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Movement, known as Pasok. 


Unco-operative

With hours to go before the opening of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Shanghai, the host, China, still rejected Taiwan's plan to send former Vice-President Li Yuan-zu. But Presidents Bush and Putin were on their way. APEC's foreign ministers signed a declaration condemning terrorism.

See article: China's disappointment <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31021_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_33>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The Indian government approved legislation to combat terrorism, making it compulsory to pass information about terrorist activities to the authorities.

See article: Crossing the line <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31024_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_36>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

India shelled Pakistani positions across the line of control in Kashmir, the most serious outbreak of hostilities for almost a year. A visit by America's secretary of state, Colin Powell, did nothing to resolve tensions.

See article: Remember Kashmir <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31023_6511231_2_80065724_60423391_1_35>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Singapore's government called a general election for November 3rd. It could have waited until August next year.

The prime minister of Japan, Junichiro Koizumi, offered a ""heartfelt apology"" to South Korea for his country's actions during the occupation of the peninsula and the second world war.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

"450 million digital TV homes expected by 2006","
This message is being sent to you by Informa Media Group 



Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/dbr/?src=dbremail> 
bookshop.informamedia.com/dbr <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/dbr/?src=dbremail> 	

By 2006 the world's leading seven countries are forecast to have 148 million digital TV homes - one third of the global total!

Dear MR M MC CONNELL, 

 Front Cover <http://bookshop.informamedia.com/cod/logos/publishing/imgt0001cover.jpg>The digital TV sector is continually evolving, enabling the expansion of new revenue-generating services. Traditional broadcasting models have been superseded by new services that cross into related industries, most notably the telecoms sector. However, the proposed analogue switch-off is still in the distance - we are now entering a crucial period as other platforms vie for a niche in the digital market. 

Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition), the latest edition of the best selling report from Informa Media Group, addresses the key issues in the developing digital broadcasting sector. Providing you with the necessary intelligence to make informed decisions, the report: 

* investigates the future direction of digital broadcasting 
* focuses on new and emerging digital technologies and the provision of new revenue streams
* evaluates which of the emerging digital platforms will be successful
* contains extensive digital settop box forecasts up to 2006
* provides in-depth profiles of the world's leading seven countries in the sector. 

New to this edition: 

Substantially expanded and fully updated, the latest edition also contains entirely new chapters on: 

* Content and rights focusing on business strategies to exploit multiple digital platforms
* Regulation and piracy as broadband Internet makes audiovisual piracy relatively easy. 

Digital broadcasting content is increasing in sophistication and broadband Internet offers an important new market in which rights owners can fully exploit their content. Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) contains case studies on leading companies, such as Canal+ and Microsoft, allowing you to assess your market position and learn from the experience of market leaders. 

Supported by a wealth of tables, statistics and forecasts, Digital Broadcasting Revolution (4th Edition) is essential reading for anyone requiring topical, up-to-date information on the global digital broadcasting sector.

"Sooners Illustrated - Al Eschbach report","Sooner defense dominates, Longhorn comedy continues.

by AL ESCHBACH

What more can you say about this Oklahoma defense? It has gotten to the
point where onlookers are disappointed when the defense gives up a first
down. And when someone drives the field for a touchdown, people are almost
amazed.

""We played okay against Texas Tech. I think we can play better,"" said
co-defensive coordinator Mike Stoops. Come on, Mike! Your unit held the
high-powered Red Raider attack to single-digit first downs. That's two
straight games Stoops' defense has done it.

Roy Williams is the best college football player in the country. He is such
a disruptive force. Williams is the best defensive back ever to play at OU.
Just ask Barry Switzer. Williams keeps on coming up with big plays after big
play.

The OU coaching staff wasn't very happy the Texas players showed up in
Lubbock to give their support to the Red Raiders. And just how did they get
those tickets right behind the Sooner bench? The Sooners have said
repeatedly they haven't been shown any respect from the Longhorns.

There are stories coming out of Austin these days that Texas is the best
team in the country and they are being shafted by the BCS. Hey guys, did you
forget the teams played earlier this year in the Cotton Bowl?

The OU-Texas rivalry is now becoming a rivalry of hatred much like it was in
the Barry Switzer/Darrell Royal eras. Royal could never understand why Texas
high school players would go to Oklahoma. Maybe it was the fact Switzer was
a lot better recruiter.

And while on the subject of recruiting in Texas, the Longhorns may have
moved into the lead on Lancaster defensive end Larry Dibbles. This talented
player made an unofficial visit to Austin last week. For the first time OU
didn't get a good feel from Dibbles when they talked to him on the
telephone.

But a lot of things can change once OU gets these Texas recruits on campus.
The Longhorns have a big edge bringing them in for unofficial trips during
their home games.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

First off ... a little aggie humor  sent my way .... 
This week during an OSU football practice, a white, powdery substance 
was 
reported to the coaching staff by an unnamed  player.  Coaches promptly 
contacted the Stillwater PD who contacted the  FBI.  Practice was 
delayed 
for 2 hours while the FBI conducted a  substance test. Practice resumed 
when 
the mysterious substance  was 
determined to be... the goalline.

Stoops on Nebraska 
By Joe Wallace 

Date:	Oct 25, 2001 

Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops celebrates on the sideline as time runs out
during the Sooners 31-14 win over top-ranked Nebraska last season in Norman.


On Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch 
Great player. Eric Crouch is an excellent player that has speed, he has
toughness, he has power. He is, without question, the nucleus and key member
in their offensive attack. Everything that happens in their offense, he's a
part of. He has the ability to make plays. He's a great player. 
On if Nebraska has as powerful of an offensive line this year as they've had
in the past I believe so. They're big, strong, physical players that have
been very productive so far this year. I believe they're consistent to what
they've had. 
On Nebraska's option compared to the other option attacks OU has faced this
year against Air Force and Kansas State Air Force is more a triple option
and a double-slot wishbone-type option. Kansas State has many similar plays
that Nebraska has, along with different ones. It's always hard to compare,
but there are similarities and there are differences. 
On if Nebraska's tall tight ends and receivers pose any problem for OU's
defense They've just got to jump higher when they throw them the ball.
They're big, strong guys.They're excellent blockers as well. 
On Nebraska tight end Tracy Wistrom 
Tracy does a great job. He's got excellent speed for a tight end.  Excellent
hands. He is a big weapon in that you get so concentrated in stopping the
run game, they like to sneak him behind you, or outside of you in different
ways that as a player and as a defense we are very aware of and constantly
keying. 
On keeping the teams emotions down and not overpursuing plays on defense
like they did last year in the first quarter against Nebraska We've had a
lot of big games since then as well, and the experience in that game will
help them. I think at that time we were coming off an off-week that also may
or may not have been a factor. I think our players are much more seasoned in
this type of atmosphere today then they were at that time last year. 
On Nebraska's defense 
Nebraska's defense has been strong all year. You look at the way they've
played, the few points they've given up, the few yards they've given up.
They've been strong. 
Tech got some big plays and executed in some situations to create those
plays. Tech made some plays on them, but I also no through the year their
defense has been very strong. 
On if Crouch is Nebraska's best runner 
Their tailbacks are very good as well. They run so much quarterback run
game, be it options, draws, quarterback leads. They have every quarterback
run play that's been invented and they keep inventing more.  He carries the
ball every bit as much as anybody on their offense, and probably the most. 
On if Crouch is a better passer this year 
Yes, but I felt he was a good thrower last year. He started off the game and
threw some very good balls that worked us and one was a touchdown.  We've
respected his throwing ability last year. I imagine, like anybody with
another year of experience, he's better at it this year then he was a year
ago. 
On if playing at Memorial Stadium in Lincoln will be the most challenging
environment his team has faced yet I don't know how you compare that. We've
been in some challenging atmospheres and I'm sure this will be as equal as
any. We understand that, but I also think it has a way of exciting and has
your team ready as well. 
On Mike Stoops' comments that Nebraska's offense is the toughest to prepare
for in college football I wouldn't argue with him. I've said it a number of
times. They're as intricate at developing schemes to run the football as any
dynamic pass offense. They're very disciplined and thorough in how they
create seams to run the football. To stop them you've got to be equally as
disciplined and be in position to read it out, and then be physical when you
get there to take it on and tackle.  Like I said, they keep inventing new
run plays and you've got to keep reading them out and figuring out ways to
try and stop them. 
On Nebraska staying at the top of college football on an annual basis That's
why everybody here has great respect for their program. It is very
impressive and a complement to their administration, as well as their entire
program the way they've been able to sustain it and do things right. 
On if he sees the OU-Nebraska as more of a rivalry of respect than the
OU-Texas rivalry I don't know. I can't speak for them, but we respect Texas.
This rivalry has always determined a conference champion, not always, but so
many times has determined a conference champion between Nebraska and OU.
This game has not only determined the conference championship, but you look
at both these schools with 12 national championships between them and so
many times, whoever has the conference championship has a chance to compete
for the national championship. I just think it's being in the conference
longer together is what the difference is. 
On if he will use films from old Oklahoma-Nebraska games to inspire the team
like he did last year I think it's important that our players truly
understand the traditional and history of this game and respect it.  Respect
the players that have been here before and how they played in those games. I
think it's good that they know and understand as much about their program as
they can. 
I wanted our players to understand and know that being here at Oklahoma,
this is how we are supposed to play. This is how, traditionally, our team
has played. And traditionally, Oklahoma has stood there and played with
anybody and played well. And in fact, has played well against Nebraska, here
at OU or in Lincoln. I felt it was important that they understood that. That
was them, that was their heritage. 
That's what it is and we needed to play at that level. I wanted them to
realize that they could. I believe it gave us the attitude or it helped us
with the attitude to go into the football game and feel confident that we're
ready for this. 
On his memories of the OU-NU series growing up 
I remember watching two of the best coached teams in the country play.  Both
teams were always very well-coached. Watching great players on the field
that the whole country knew about. And watching exciting plays.  The
breakaway plays on both sides. I couldn't wait to watch this game as a young
person. 
I can remember back to Steve Owens, and what a big, strong guy this is
that's running the ball. I remember Johnny Rodgers and the great returns
that he had. Greg Pruitt and some of the games he had. I'm not smart enough
to remember the details of them all, but I can remember those players and
the plays they made. 
On if the loser of this game still has a realistic shot at the national
title Probably so, if both teams are able to win out and meet in the
championship game. I would imagine that would have a chance to happen.  I'm
sure there's a possibility. 
On the possibility of scheduling Nebraska during the years OU does not play
them in conference play I don't know how you could unless you want to change
the league and how you play the games. I don't know how the setup would
work. There's no sense in me even worrying about it. 
On how much Jason White's experience playing in a big game against Texas
will help against Nebraska I think it will help him greatly. His experience
in that game and his experience in the last two. Experience is experience. 
When you're out there playing you don't realize the setting, you don't hear
anybody. It gets down to the experience of playing. He gets better the more
he plays. I believe he'll handle it well. The bottom line is you're playing
against a good team. You've got to outperform them or make more plays than
they do. Jason will go in there going after it like everybody else. That's
what you feel good about. 
On if he feels good about Nebraska having played in more big games this
season I don't know if it's an advantage. They have guys that have been
around awhile that have been in big games. We understand what it takes to
compete in these games, but I'm sure they do as well.

Coaches Corner: The greatest rivalry in football 
By Merv Johnson 
Date:	Oct 25, 2001 

This week Coach Johnson gives his thoughts on why OU-NU is the greatest 
rivalry in college football 

Finally, the week the Sooners play the Cornhuskers has arrived! Everyone can
now talk openly about playing Nebraska without prefacing everything with an
""If"". Both teams have made it into the showdown undefeated and highly
ranked. The eyes of all of college football will be watching.  Things are
finally back in order in this conference and in the national college
football scene. 
The Oklahoma-Nebraska rivalry, is, in my mind, the very best in all of
football for all the right reasons. Both teams, coaching staffs and fans,
have the utmost respect for each other. The ""hype"" leading up to the game
and the media coverage after the game are complementary, classy and fair. No
dirt, no cheap shots and credit where credit is due. The game itself has
always been fiercely contested without the ""crap"" on the field or in the
stands that marks far too many rivalries. 
Plus, except for 1995, 96, and 97 when we fell off the face of the earth, it
has been one great college football contest. In my first ten years at
Oklahoma (1979-88) the winner was conference champion, played in the Orange
Bowl and played there three times for the National Championship. The entire
nation eagerly awaited this game because they knew two of the countries best
would go at it in a well-played football game. 
The only real regret I have had with the Big XII is that the OU-Nebraska
game was not played every year. When the Southwest Conference split into two
divisions they made sure all the old ""rivalry"" games were protected.  Surely
some scheduling adjustment could have been made by the conference
forefathers to have allowed this contest to be an exception. It was the only
""big time"" rivalry affected by going to the North-South divisions.  It would
have been such a plus for the conference each year. 
I know exactly what it will be like Saturday when the team arrives at the
stadium. There will be people everywhere dressed in red just like it is
here, except most of it will be that pale red Nebraska wears. The dressing
room is fairly spacious and ""old school"" traditional - just like Notre Dame
was. Visiting teams have used those same quarters, probably, for seventy
years. 
When you leave the dressing room it is about an eighty-yard walk right
through the crowd. A narrow corridor is roped through that mob of people who
reach out to ""give you five"" as you walk by. And they are nice!  That's what
I remember more than anything. They don't yell obscenities, etc. and after
the game, win or lose, they say ""good game"", ""good luck"" and generally defy
what you come to expect from having been to many of the other places we
play. When you finally enter the playing field it's like what it must have
been for those gladiators centuries ago. The stands surround you as the
seats in the end zones occupy as much area as the sides. The fans in red are
crammed in everywhere - and very close to the field. You'd have to not be
much of a competitor to go in there and not play your best! 
In the twenty-three seasons I've been at Oklahoma, I don't think we've ever
gone to Lincoln as the favorite. Consequently, some of those victories there
were remarkably fabulous experiences. Likewise, a couple of the losses were
heart-breaking and a couple were downright embarrassing. I truly felt in
1995 and 1997 we let the Nebraska fans down about as much as we did our
Sooner fans because I know they expected so much more from Oklahoma. 
Who will ever forget in 1980 J.C. Watts pitching the ball to Buster Rhymes,
who raced down the sideline in front of our bench that set up a short
game-winning pass to Bobby Grayson? Or the two times our defense stuffed
Nebraska on fourth and one to keep us in the game. 
How about Brian Hall and the defense holding Nebraska for four downs inside
the five in the fourth quarter to keep the score at 10-7? Or Danny Bradley's
ensuing 60-yard scamper to win the 1984 game 17-7. 
In 1986 the Sooners were 90-yards away and appeared done-in with very little
time left. Then, Keith Jackson and Jamelle Holieway performed their version
of ""Sooner Magic."" Jackson and some unbelievable plays and Tim Lasher kicked
his second field goal as time ran out to create a 20-17 victory. It all
happened in the last five minutes. 
The following year, 1987, the schedule change forced us to play in Lincoln
again. No one gave the Sooners much of a chance because our QB, Holieway,
and FB, Lydell Carr, were out of the game with injuries. Their respective
replacements, Charles Thompson and Rotnei Anderson and the Sooner running
game have never been better as the good guys won 17-7.  Unbelievably, our
defense held the great Nebraska offense 12 consecutive possessions without a
first down. One, two, three, and out! 
Neither team is going to go into the game to lose! But someone will have to.
I hope, though, that it will be another of those great games for all the
country to see. And I hope, too, that we can have a rematch come December in
Dallas. 
In his 19 years as an OU assistant coach, he helped the Sooners build a
150-67-5 record, win a national championship and five Big Eight Conference
titles and post seven bowl game victories.

From The Economist print edition 




Staying aloft

	
	  <http://www.economist.com/images/20011027/4301WW3.jpg>	
	
	
	

Switzerland's federal government, some cantons and some of the country's biggest companies-including Nestl?, Novartis, UBS and Credit Suisse-decided that a national airline was required irrespective of cost. Although most national airlines look in a sorry state, government and business stumped up SFr4.24 billion ($2.6 billion) to recapitalise Crossair, a Swiss regional airline that will take over two-thirds of bankrupt Swissair's aircraft and routes.

See article: Europe's airlines and subsidies <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31713_6557115_2_80065724_60423391_1_46>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Britain and America resumed talks aimed at an ""open skies"" agreement that would allow more airlines to ply their trade between the two countries, and would persuade America's antitrust authorities to allow an alliance between BA and American Airlines. The French government confirmed a similar deal to enable an alliance between Air France and Delta. BA also began alliance talks with KLM Royal Dutch; other European airlines are likely to seek allies.


America's bad results

America's biggest companies had a tough week. AMR, parent company of American Airlines, the world's biggest, reported a loss of $525m in the latest quarter, including losses related to September 11th, compared with a profit of $322m last year. 

Viacom, an American media giant that owns CBS, MTV and Paramount Pictures among others, announced a net loss of $190m in the third quarter, partly as a result of lost advertising revenue after September 11th.

See article: Media and the economic downturn <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31712_6557115_2_80065724_60423391_1_45> 

Lucent Technologies, an American telecoms-equipment maker, reported losses in the latest quarter of $8.8 billion compared with $484m in the same period last year. Much of the loss is accounted for by restructuring costs that will see its workforce reduced by almost half, to as few as 57,000 by March next year.

Honeywell lost $308m in the third quarter after restructuring costs of $1 billion. It also said 4,100 jobs would go next year in addition to 15,800 announced in September.

Xerox announced a fifth consecutive quarterly loss, of $211m, slightly more than a year ago. The copier company has spent some years in the doldrums and claimed that a restructuring plan had been put back by the aftermath of September 11th.

Profits at ExxonMobil, the world's biggest publicly-traded oil company, fell by 23% in the third quarter, to $3.3 billion, compared with the same period the year before when the company made the highest profits ever recorded by an American company. Falling oil prices are largely to blame.

Enron's share price suffered a second blow a week after its third-quarter results showed a one-off charge of $1 billion related to investments that had gone awry. Investors took further fright after the energy-trading giant admitted that one of the deals, involving its chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, had caught the eye of America's Securities and Exchange Commission, which then started an informal investigation of Enron. Mr Fastow is being replaced. 

America's International Trade Commission agreed with the country's steel companies that foreign competition was adversely affecting domestic producers. This opens the way for the government to introduce tariffs and quotas on foreign steel. The European Union threatened action through the WTO if restrictions were introduced.


Sent packing?

It was reported that the European Commission would block a euro1.7 billion ($1.5 billion) purchase by France's Tetra Laval of a rival Swedish packaging company, Sidel. The Commission fears for competition in the drinks-packaging market.

America's Federal Trade Commission voted to block the $8.2 billion sale of Seagram's drink businesses to Diageo, a British drink company, fearing that it would create a rum duopoly with Bacardi. Diageo said it would give up the Malibu rum brand to prevent the deal from being beached.

Germany's Ifo business-climate index plummeted to its lowest level since 1993 and its biggest monthly fall since 1973-worrying signs that Europe's largest economy is leading the way toward recession.

See article: Germany's troubled economy <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31714_6557115_2_80065724_60423391_1_47>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>


Japan's losses

Fujitsu announced losses of ?175 billion ($1.4 billion) in the six months to September. The Japanese electronics giant suffered from the falling demand for chips and telecoms equipment. The company added a further 4,500 job losses to the 16,400 announced in August.

Sony, another Japanese electronics giant, reported a second quarterly loss, of ?13.2 billion ($111m), in the three months to September. Weaker consumer demand has hit sales in America. However, the company's game division moved back into profit, thanks to rising sales of PlayStation2.

Japan's economics minister, Heizo Takenaka, said that redenominating the yen was again under consideration as part of wider economic restructuring; removing two noughts would bring it into line with the dollar and euro. The measure is more usually associated with countries that are suffering hyperinflation to restore confidence; deflation-stricken Japan would perhaps be better advised to add some zeroes.

<br><br><br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>The good oil</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Oil-industry consolidation continues, as <b>Phillips Petroleum</b> and <b>Conoco</b> announced a $15 billion all-share merger. The new company, to be called ConocoPhillips, is likely to be the sixth-biggest producer in the world, based on revenues.</font></p>

<img src=""http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif"" hspace=""2"" width=""17"" height=""10"" alt=""E+""></font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Normandy Mining</b>, of Australia, wooed by rival bids from America's <b>Newmont Mining</b> and South Africa's<b> AngloGold</b>, rejected AngloGold's all-share bid. This paves the way for a possible sweetened counter-offer from AngloGold, the world's second-largest gold producer. </font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Enron's</b> financial turmoil worsened. But the Texan energy giant managed to put off repayment of some debts until mid-December. Enron's shares plunged to ten-year lows, casting greater doubt over its plans to be taken over in a rescue bid by smaller rival <b>Dynegy</b>.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Three <b>European steel makers</b>, Aceralia, Arbed and Usinor, patched up differences that had threatened their plans to merge, by agreeing to reduce Usinor's stake in the combined entity. The new company will be the world's biggest steel maker.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>Optimism at last</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">The <b>Dow Jones Industrial Average </b>has climbed by nearly 20% above its lows on September 21st, leading some optimists to announce the emergence of a new bull market. The index came within 23 points of the 10,000 mark before falling back.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">
<a href=""http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_34880_6659355_2_80065724_60423391_1_57"">See article: Messages of hope?</a>
</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Brand names got a boost in Europe. The European Court of Justice handed a victory to jeans maker <b>Levi Strauss</b> when it ruled that sales of so-called &#8220;parallel imports&#8221; from outside the European Union's jurisdiction were allowed only with the consent of the trademark owner. The decision ends Levi's three-year battle with Tesco, a British supermarket chain, that sold cut-price Levi's jeans imported from the United States.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">American <b>industrial production</b> fell for the 13th straight month, the longest continuous decline since the second world war. Other indicators were more optimistic: the Conference Board's index of leading indicators rose by 0.3% in October, raising hopes that the widely expected recession might not last long.</font></p>

<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1""><b>Schmidtbank</b>, a 170-year-old family-owned German bank, was rescued from some decidedly modern investments by a consortium of bigger peers, including Deutsche Bank, <font size=""-1"">HVB</font> Group, Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank. Schmidtbank has racked up losses from Consors, an online broker, as well as from bad loans to Germany's <i>Mittelstand</i> companies.</font></p>
<br clear=""all""><div><font face=""verdana, geneva, arial, sans serif""><b>French connections</b></font></div>
<p><font FACE=""verdana,geneva,arial,sans serif"" size=""-1"">Shares in <b>Bull</b>, the troubled French computer company, shot up when its chairman, Guy de Panafieu, resigned.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Subject: [TxWAG2001] Rescue Dogs



Hi all,
I currently have two rescue's I'm looking for homes for.

The most urgent situation is a dog in Dallas, Riley.
He is 4.5 years.  Must be the only pet, and go to a home
without children.  The ideal situation would be an older,
settled couple, or person.  Riley was abused and is a
terrified dog.  He needs to have a home with a yard, because
as of now, he can't go for a walk.  He shuts down if he
sees another dog, a person, a car... anything unfamiliar.
I'm sure the right person could build his confidence back,
but for now, he needs a very secure environment.  
I need to find Riley a home by this Sunday!  And, he can't
be shipped.  I do have a picture of him.

My other rescue is Jessie.  I still haven't found a home
for her.  But, she is not so urgent.  Jessie also needs to
be the only pet, she terrorized the other two dogs she 
used to live with.  It's possible she was abused, she
doesn't trust anyone, and will growl at you.  She needs
to go to a home without children, I can't take a chance 
with her actually being pushed to the point of biting.
She is getting along fine with Jazz and Shasta, but I keep
thinking she is going to start feeling comfortable one of
these days, and our smooth times will be over!  Jessie will
need someone with lot's of patience, and who has time to
work with her.  She needs rules, and someone to enforce them.
She is a pretty dominant little gal.  

If anyone has any suggestions, call me: 832-358-9842, or 
email me:  ccamp@pdq.net

Thanks,
Cindy

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria

OK, so maybe I was a bit optimistic . . . The work on the siding and soffits 
went very slowly, the plumbing was not completed, the paint for the second 
exterior coat did not arrive and the landscaping has been delayed.  According 
to Will Greenough, our construction manager from Habitat, his anticipated 
completion date of December 15 has slipped again to as late as mid January.  
Much of the delay is attributable to complications arising from the concrete 
construction, which made otherwise simple jobs very time consuming.  You 
should have seen the plumbers trying to drill through ten-inch concrete walls!
 
What all this means for us is that we have at least two more weekends of 
work.  If you are free on either November 24 or December 1, or both, please 
come out.  All of us find ourselves in the middle of crowded schedules this 
time of year, so anyone who can make the time to help, even for a half day, 
is very welcome.  We will continue on the siding and soffits, repainting and 
landscaping.  The going is slow, but the house can't be completed without it. 
 Let me know if you will be there so we can plan for food and drink.  We 
won't have van service on November 24, but we can arrange car pools from the 
church if there is any interest.
 
Thanks again to Ken Jones and Martha Cochrum for keeping us well fed.  Also 
to Jeanne Koch for keeping us safe (and not falling off the ladder) and to 
???chainsaw Felker??? for not cutting anything but the trees.  Also to Allene 
Ford for her example of boundless energy and to our crew chiefs, including 
Bob Mahlstedt and Roger Fowler, for getting the job done.  Our site is full 
of the sense of warmth and family that makes St. Paul's such a special place 
for worship. For that, thank you all.
 
If you would like to help in acquiring the washer and dryer for the Franco???s, 
please make a check out to St. Paul???s and indicate that it is for Habitat on 
the memo line.  We received several generous gifts already to make this a 
reality.  You can either give the check to me or send it directly to the 
church.  I will send additional information on the dedication as we get 
closer.
 
Thank you all for your dedication.  If any of you have questions or comments, 
please feel free to respond by return email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Transwestern Capacity Release Report - 10/2001","Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides information for October 2001 invoicing.  The spreads to the California border narrowed during the month of October.  Therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by PG&E (Core) are below TW's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate.
If you have questions or need additional information, please let me know.

Market - CERA Alert 



Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

"Sooner Recruiting News - James Hale","                      RECRUITING: JUCO LB says OU will be tough to beat
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001

                      The latest on San Francisco junior college linebacker
Lance Mitchell's visit to
                      Norman


                     LANCE MITCHELL, MLB, 6'3, 243, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C,
CALIFORNIA:

                     JH: How did your visit to OU this weekend go?

                     LM: Oklahoma was real good and I had a great time.
Oklahoma has a need for
                     linebackers and that is important to me. The people
were great and the town was
                     super. Being from LA, many people told me that I
wouldn't like a small town like
                     Norman, but that wasn't true. Norman seems to be a
great town and a great town
                     that I could live in. My host was Roy Williams and he
is a great guy. He showed us
                     a little Cali love!

                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?

                     LM: I loved the defensive scheme. I loved the people
that were on the field that
                     would be back if I went to Oklahoma. I liked the
coaches and how they went about
                     their business. I think I would fit in real well with
them.

                     JH: What did you think of the way OU plays it's middle
linebacker?

                     LM: It is designed for that player in the middle to
make the plays. Either you do or
                     you don't, but you have every opportunity to make the
plays.

                     JH: Roy Williams was the host, how did you enjoy our
visit with him?

                     LM: Roy was pretty depressed about the game, but I was
pretty mad to. We went
                     to a party that night and just hung out. We didn't do
all that much, but we had a
                     great time, because he was such a great guy and all the
players we met were
                     super. Roy is a super person and so are the rest of the
guys as well.

                     JH: Did you come close to committing to OU?

                     LM: I promised my mom I wouldn't commit and I didn't,
but I really enjoyed the
                     visit. However, if signing day was tomorrow I would
sign with OU. OU is out in front
                     of the schools that I have visited thus far. I was
supposed to visit Texas this
                     weekend, but that changed, because they will play for
the Big 12 title. However, I
                     don't know if I am going to visit Texas or not, because
I am finding out they have
                     a lot more depth and commitments than they have been
telling me about. I will
                     visit Florida on December 14th.

                     JH: What did you think of the game?

                     LM: Being a fellow football player I can tell when the
better team isn't winning. That
                     is what happened Saturday. The offense never really got
it going and that happens
                     sometimes. You can't leave your defense on the field
for the whole game. If OU
                     played them 10 times I am not sure OU wouldn't win the
next ten. I my opinion,
                     OU played a bunch of cheerleaders and lost, but it
won't happen again.

                     JH: What did you think of the atmosphere?

                     LM: It's was great and I would love to play in front of
that.

                     JH: Would it take a super visit from one of the teams
ahead for you not
                     to come to OU?

                     LM: I am a shy guy, yet I had so much fun there. The
people were just so nice to
                     me and made me relax and be myself. That is so
important to me and OU has that
                     naturally. can't see anybody beating OU at this point.

                      RECRUITING: Jackson enjoys visit to Norman
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 26, 2001

                      Junior college linebacker Pasha Jackson talks about
his trip to Norman this
                      weekend


                     PASHA JACKSON, SLB, 6'3, 235, 4.5, SAN FRANCISCO C.C.,
CALIFORNIA:

                     JH: How was your trip to OU?

                     PJ: The trip was excellent, even though they had a
tough game. The chemistry
                     between players and coaches was excellent. I loved
everything about the trip,
                     except for the game, because I was wanting Oklahoma to
win. I really enjoyed
                     watching Coach (Brent) Venables because he is a very
intense, positive guy and I
                     like that. I could tell he is a great coach, which
means a lot to me, because I will
                     be spending most of my time with him.

                     JH: Did Lance like the trip as well?

                     PJ: Lance and I talked about the trip all the way back
on the plane. He had nothing
                     but positive things to say about OU as well. We both
feel that we both can see
                     nothing but positives about both us going to OU.

                     JH: Did you almost commit to OU on the trip?

                     PJ: OU made committing more tempting that any other
visit thus far. We were
                     close to committing, but I feel I need to take my other
visits so that I know for
                     sure who my best school is going to be. I am not
committing, but OU is looking
                     pretty good. Without question they are the best school
that we have visited thus
                     far.

                     JH: What did you think of the OU defense?

                     PJ: I like OU's defense. I feel I would fit in at the
SLB position when they are in
                     their standard defense, but I can also play in their
nickel. Because I can play in the
                     nickel and have a linebacker type body on the field,
that would help their run
                     support, which is important in a conference like the
Big 12. It would enhance the
                     defense, because I am a bigger and stronger player, yet
I can easily help in pass
                     coverage.

                     JH: What did you think of Norman?

                     PJ: A lot of my people are from Louisiana and the
surrounding area, so I know
                     about that part of the country. Granted, Norman is not
like Los Angeles, but it is
                     not small town either. You can have a lot of fun in
Norman and have a good quality
                     of life. The people are real down to earth and are very
nice. When Lance and I
                     went to your radio show the people were so down to
earth that it touched us,
                     because they were so kind to two total strangers. I
could easily live in Norman.

                     JH: What is up next for you in recruiting?

                     PJ: I am going to visit my next two schools, which are
Arizona and South Carolina,
                     but going into those visits OU is way out in front.

                      BASKETBALL RECRUITING: Kevin Bookout update
                      By James Hale
                      Date: Nov 25, 2001

                      The latest on six-foot-seven Stroud power forward
Kevin Bookout


                     KEVIN BOOKOUT, 6'7, STROUD, OKLAHOMA:

                     There is still nothing official to report on whether
Bookout signed with OU or not.
                     Bookout told me tonight he will make an official
statement on the subject
                     Wednesday or Thursday.

                     Here are my thoughts from what I have been able to
gather as facts.

                     1) I have no doubts that Bookout is going to be a
Sooner. The question is in which
                     sport ? basketball or track ? or both? I believe that
Bookout has singed with the
                     OU basketball program, but what I don't know is if OU
has turned in the papers or
                     not.

                     2) The reason that I am not sure if the papers are in
or not is because Bookout is
                     struggling with the question of just competing in track
or playing both basketball
                     and track in college. Plus, there has been no official
announcement. If OU never
                     turns in the papers, then it is just like he didn't
sign.

                     3) If Bookout just decides to pursue track and field at
OU then he needs to sign a
                     scholarship with the OU track program, because you must
participate with the
                     program you sign with your freshman season. If he is
going to play both sports at
                     OU then OU hoops will turn in those scholarship papers
if they can, or they will
                     resign him in the spring.

                     4) The U.S.A. Olympic committee is putting a lot of
pressure on Bookout to just
                     compete in track and field. They don't care if he goes
to OU or not, but they want
                     him to just concentrate on the shot and discus. They
certainly have Bookout's ear
                     at the moment. However, he has told the OU basketball
coaches several times
                     over the past few days that he wants to play basketball
and then he talks to U.S.A.
                     Track and gets confused.

                     5) I believe when this is all said and done that
Bookout will play both sports at OU.
                     It may mean that he has to resign with OU hoops again
in the spring, but then
                     again maybe the fact he has already signed in the fall
will count in some way. So,
                     this isn't totally in the books yet, except that I know
Bookout is going to OU. I just
                     don't know if it is to play both basketball and
track-and-field or just participate in
                     track.

"This week in Sooners Illustrated","Another big relief job from Jason White and another smothering performance by the Oklahoma defense. That's the combination punch the Sooners used to beat Kansas, and run the nation's longest winning streak to 19 straight. Of course, Sooners Illustrated was on location, bringing its readers every exciting detail, from kickoff to the final gun. All of the emotion, each bone-crushing hit, and every subtle detail can be found inside SI's pages, including features, views from inside the huddle and the behind-the-scenes scoop.

Sooners Illustrated delivers the most comprehensive coverage of Oklahoma athletics you'll find anywhere, especially when it comes to football. Sooner Magic is as close as your fingertips with every action-packed issue of SI.

Here's a glimpse of what in the latest edition of SI:

Oklahoma takes care of Kansas by Jay Upchurch
SI's editor takes a look at the third-ranked Sooners' performance on the road against an improved Kansas squad.

OU-Texas Grade Card by George Schroeder
How did each of Oklahoma's positions rate against the Jayhawks in the final analysis. What areas need improvement and who came up big?

Four Questions by Clay Horning
Questions from the Kansas game that all OU football fans want the answers to, from key plays to national title runs. Is the quarterback controversy back?

The Road Warrior
Our fan in the stands delivers his unique opinion from the aftermath of the Sooners' 38-10 victory over Kansas.

Bob Stoops postgame Kansas
Oklahoma's third-year coach talks about the Sooners' victory over Kansas in detail.

Scouting Baylor by Andrew Gilman
The Bears used to be just plain bad. But Kevin Steele seems to have Baylor pointed in the right direction. How much ground have they made up on OU?

Antwone Savage Pop Quiz by Lisa Munn
OU's talented receiver takes our get-to-know-you pop quiz, and gives some surprising answers.

Texas' reality is skewed by George Schroeder
Two straight Oklahoma wins in the Cotton Bowl, and Texas still doesn't get it.

Bigtime Billy Brooks by Jay Upchurch
During the early 1970s, Billy Brooks and Tinker Owens gave Oklahoma one of the best 1-2 receiving punches in college football. Too bad the Sooners only threw the ball 8-10 times a game.

Football Report by Carey Murdock & Jay Upchurch
Freshman quarterback Brent Rawls has looked impressive during his first season with the Sooners; former OU linebacker Travian Smith now makes his living with the Oakland Raiders.

Recruiting Profiles by Al Eschbach
The Sooners have already received commitments from a pair of talented prep quarterbacks in the 2002 recruiting class.

Recruiting Report - Change of Heart? by Carey Murdock
Just how big of an impact does the outcome of the OU-Texas game play with young recruits trying to decide which direction to go?

Camera Shy: Martin Flores by Bobby Anderson
OU freshman golfer Martin Flores is adjusting his swing and adjusting to being a star at a whole new level.

Men's Hoops Report by Al Eschbach
Frequent flyer miles are down for OU coach Kelvin Sampson, as he sticks a little closer to the home recruiting front this fall.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Sooners Illustrated also delivers beautiful action photos, including a full color pull-out poster, game stats and a whole lot more.

It's time to join the Sooners Illustrated family.

"Sooners Illustrated - This week's issue","Now it's 20 straight wins and one step closer to the showdown in Lincoln. That's where the second-ranked Sooners find themselves after finishing off Baylor, 33-17, this past weekend. As always, Sooners Illustrated was in the middle of the action, looking to gather and deliver every thrilling detail to its faithful readers. If you are looking for the best coverage of Oklahoma football, inside and out, you've come to the right spot. SI's pages are full of features, facts and articles you can't find anywhere else.

Week in and week out, Sooners Illustrated delivers the most comprehensive coverage of Oklahoma athletics you'll find anywhere. And this week is our annual Basketball Preview issue, featuring updates and key information on the OU men's and women's hardwood teams. Sooner Magic is as close as your fingertips with every action-packed issue of SI.

Here's a glimpse of what in the latest edition of SI:

Oklahoma sends Baylor packing by Jay Upchurch

Hollis Price Pop Quiz by Lisa Munn
OU's junior guard takes our get-to-know-you pop quiz, and gives some rather tall answers in the process.

New Faces Stepping In by Jay Upchurch
Kelvin Sampson brought in a super recruiting class to help ease the loss of five key players from last year's 26-7 Sooner team. Who's going to fit in where, and how good are these guys?

Reloading Zone: OU's season preview by Jay Upchurch
After losing five of its top eight players last season, one might think this would be a rebuilding year in Soonerland. Think again.

The Big Three: Dales, Caufield, Hill by Jenni Carlson
The biggest reason Oklahoma finds itself picked so high in so many preseason polls is simple - Stacey Dales, LaNeishea Caufield and Caton Hill, possibly the best 1-2-3 punch in the country.

Celebration: OU women picked No. 1 by Guerin Emig
It's true. The Oklahoma women's basketball team has been picked for the top spot by at least one preseason hoops publication.

Recruiting Profiles by Al Eschbach
Greg Pruitt, Jr.: Like father, like son? Exploring the possibilities of getting another famous Pruitt in the OU backfield.

And that's just for starters. Sooners Illustrated also delivers beautiful action photos, including a full color pull-out poster, game stats and a whole lot more.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.

3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.
