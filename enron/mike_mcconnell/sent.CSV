"Howdy","
Marissa,

Hey!  Just thinking about you.  I hope all is well out west.  Things here are sure interesting.  You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.  I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.  This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).  Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.  We should find out pretty soon.

I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.  He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.  It seems to be right up his ally.  He asked me to tell you hello.

Sarah and I took vacation last week.  I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.  It was fun.

Please write back and let me know how you are doing.  How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.

Mark

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Jonathan,

Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.

Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.

I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.

Best of luck,

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

Erica,

It sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation (I wouldn't have guessed otherwise).  The fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want.  Sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is.  I truly wish you the best and I certainly want to know where you place yourself.

Oh, I heard from Andy.  They have settled in Denver and he is still looking for a job but he may do some contract work for Enron.  I'm not sure how definite it is or what he'll be doing.  I'll let you know what I find out.

I really can't believe things happened the way they did.  I thought everything was set for you guys to get another opportunity for the national championship.  I also thought the case for Roy Williams to win the Heisman would become really strong.  I didn't get to watch the OU-OSU game, but I received about 30 phone calls the last two minutes of the game.

I am excited that some breaks have gone our way, but it will be difficult to beat CU twice in one season.  Also, I am not sure that I want to ever play Miami after seeing them the last two weeks.

Don't be too upset, you guys are going to be tough next year and you are riding a two year win streak on us right now....(11-0 would sound a lot better than 10-1).

I'll be heading to Dallas early Saturday morning.  

Take care,

The following 2 scenarios were run and meet our return requirements.  The total volume of 306 comes from the 240 suggested starting volumes and the additional volumes come from expiring El Paso/MGI transportation agreements.

_______________________________

1)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2479 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.2479 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.2479 for yrs 4-15

2)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2600 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.1883 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.1883 for yrs 4-15
_______________________________


We would suggest Showing PEMEX either scenario but using the round numbers of $.25 (instead of $.2479) for scenario 1 and $.19 (instead of $.1883) for scenario 2.

Please let me know if you have a preference.  We would like to fax one of these scenarios to Jorge @ 3:00 today so that they can digest it and use it for a starting point for tomorrow's meeting.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)

Subject: FWD:Hello from Houston


Mark,

""Godav"" to you too. And great to hear from you again.

Yes, certainly the world has changed since we last met. As it turned out I was 
in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all of 
us in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the 
States. 

- With one exception: We have had terrorism here for a very long time. So much 
so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA 
semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one...

And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic 
every day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though London 
probably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly.

Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally if 
find it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably it 
was inevitable.

But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron. 
Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole.

My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3 
months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US.

Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for a 
small group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not ""hunting"" myself, but 
rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business 
development. We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a 
Houston company before long, but I am not expecting to have to go there for 
some time to come.

You may notice that I am sending this e-mail from a new address. I am trying to 
face out the old one, since it has caused me endless problems. So in future 
please use the new one: martin@heelas-joergensen.com (heelas being my wife's 
maiden name).

I am very pleased to hear that you are well, but would rather hope that you 
could find an excuse to come to London, even if your pipelines do not reach 
that far...


All the best,


Martin

I think we should go smaller for Christmas.  Boots can wait until next year.  We have Alphonse to pay, plus JDF, plus I still haven't given anything to A&M for the year.

I think he is probably making the right call; however, y'all are rolling right now and haven't lost this year.  I'm not sure it is wise to tweak the machine now....then again, you can't argue with a coach on a 19 game winning streak.

Is the OU/NU game next weekend?

Man I hear you.  I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.  On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.  It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.

Subject: HABITAT
 
St. Paul's United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project 



Welcome Habitat Volunteers! 

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming response from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule volunteers for particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17. We want to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate without overcrowding the building site.  If I have scheduled you for a date you are unavailable, please let me know; there are plenty of people to step in!  The schedule for October 20 is attached.  Others will follow shortly. 

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide drinks, but you should bring water for yourself. 

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at the site. 

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.    

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He will provide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of the Saturdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to me.  You can contact him at ""changing@swbell.net"" or 281-461-4709. 

We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are qualified to be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize food/water/beverage, daily registration, clean up or tool management, please let me know. 

For additional information, contact me at: 713-748-3317; fax 713-741-6233; or email: lesliewmadams@aol.com. 

Peace and grace, 

Les

Attached is the confidentiality agreement that we are signing with Aquila.  It was originated out of our legal group but Aquila added:

I would like to use it for Reliant too.  Any problem with that?  Please let me know.

Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

"Hello from Houston","
Mr. Joergensen,

A big ""Howdy"" from your Texas friend.  

I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.

As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.

I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.

Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.

It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.

Take care Martin.  It was great to hear your voice.

Mark

"RE: See ya","

Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.

Boomer Sooner,

Mark

Great game.  Until somebody beats y'all, you should be number one as far as I am concerned.  Great play by Roy Williams.  I couldn't believe how poorly both teams ran the football...and for that matter how poor both offenses looked.  I will say that both defenses looked tough.  It was tough to watch the collapse in the final two minutes.

I love our staff, but unfortunately, I think we were outcoached.  That being said, Bob Stoops could be the luckiest coach in the world....everything seems to fall his way.  He is a great coach.

Take care and I guess I am stuck waithing another 363 days.

Howdy Heidi,

Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.  I hope all is well with you and your hubby.

Awfully weird times here in the home office.  Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.  I guess it is the same or similar there too.

The pipeline group is working out.  I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.

Please respond and let me know what you are up to and how you are doing.  I'm so sorry we didn't hook up when you were in town last time.

Importance:	High

	Mark: The following are certain Right-of-Way needs and/or questions.

	1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA?
	
	2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc.

	3. An Encroachment report.

	4. A Rental/Term report.

	5. A report identifying any known curative problems.

	6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured?
		
		a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents
		b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations
		c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts
		d. Relocations
			i. Anaheim Hills
			ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private)
		e. Franchise Agreements

	7. Will new pipe be required for connection of Four Corners pipeline to existing Transwestern pipeline system? If so, would this be across the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in Mohave County, AZ?

	It is my understanding that this due diligence will not involve the balance of Arizona, which includes the Navajos', Hopis' and the Bennett Freeze area (disputed tribal lands). Is this correct?	 [McConnell, Mark]  YES, the West Leg only includes California.

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:

Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land

I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was

I get it right.

"PGE/ FERC article","

FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS TRANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULATION

09/27/2001 
Foster Natural Gas Report 
Page 7 
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc. 
FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain consolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions between PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various shippers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these transactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates. 
The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity available to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violate regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiated rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to further explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identification of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it can demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of time. 
Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier 
FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Transwestern made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transactions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 order, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate transactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would not have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shippers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactions, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short time. 
In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market price differentials between the California border and producing basins in New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $27/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excluding surcharges and fuel. 
In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer scrutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: ""Did Transwestern withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiated rate charges at substantially higher rates?"" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10.) 
Background 
Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Reliant Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Enserco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Energy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01, 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates tied to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pipeline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Oregon-California border. 
According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions would yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore questions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacity may be available on the GTN system. 
GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose to structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway. Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations. 
Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information: 
- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sempra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority reverse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the capacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure that would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that the gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate, or the Southern California border market. 
- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 recourse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-index spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believed the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it ""a pricing opportunity."" 
- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at the FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volume to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted another price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 MMBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate. 
- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 order. 
- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather than the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the time the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mirant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfield to Malin. 
- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippers: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as proposed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to refund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy stated that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because it believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate. 
FERC Has Serious Concerns 
According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions under investigation ""present several serious concerns."" Even with the additional information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise many issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited hearing should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the transportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair manner consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were the product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just to make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shippers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been available; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable primary points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory against interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is also available on a somewhat best-efforts basis). 
Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational capacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertake immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational capacity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is awarded. 
Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities available at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Sempra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,000 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of recourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect the exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Commission surmises.

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to

Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:

Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land

I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was
in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure
I get it right.

I would appreciate any help.

	Williams Launches uE Web Site For Cross Commodity Pricing 
	Tulsa-based Williams on Monday launched uE, a cross-commodity price index for both spot and future energy prices, as a companion to its web-based EnergyNewsLive.com. Similar to the Dow Jones for equity markets, the Williams uE will offer an equivalent benchmark for the overall price of energy, measuring the price average of eight individual commodities: electricity, natural gas, unleaded gasoline, heating oil, ethane, propane, residual fuel and jet fuel. 
	The site includes information on pricing trends including a national spot uE, forward uE, regional uE, commodity quotes, as well as daily, weekly and monthly commentary. Included on the site is EnergyPulse, which will feature Dr. Dennis O'Brien, director of energy and policy at the University of Oklahoma. EnergyPulse now airs every Friday on Williams' EnergyNewsLive site, and offers an analysis of trends in energy pricing and the impact the economy has on energy. 
	Williams uE was introduced a year ago when EnergyNewsLive debuted, and Williams said it has tested and refined the site for the company's own market activity. It also has been reviewed by the Energy Information Administration, said Williams. To view the site, visit www.williams-ue.com.

Kim, Mark listed below are the ETS Operations employees that will participate in the Southern Trails due diligence October 29th and 30th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

	L.D. Stephens - Team Leader/Operations
	Larry Campbell - Environmental
	???????? - ROW (To be determined by Johnny McGee and communicated directly to you)
	Mike Ames - Pipeline Safety

As discussed, these employees will arrive in Salt Lake, Sunday evening, October 28th prepared to go to the data room Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th.  They will return to their respective home locations Wednesday morning, October 31st.

Please provide a Questar contact person and address of the data room.  If you could also provide the name of a hotel close to the data room, it would be appreciated.
Names of other Enron parties participating in the due diligence and where they are staying would be helpful.  Any specific limitations imposed upon the data room review
should be communicated as soon as possible.

Morris Brassfield (Operations Support) and Jerry Martin (E&C) have determined that it is not necessary for them to have personnel attend the data room.  The operations team will retrieve as much information as possible to support their needs.  It was also my understanding no one from Planning and System Optimization would participate.

As I will be out of town the rest of the week, please communicate directly with these individuals via e mail.  If you need to need to contact me, I can be reached at 713-303-2764.

Subject: FW: New hook up request


Mark
This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?


Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16"" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?


Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project?

Subject:	RE: Well hook up request

Pipeline: The proposed location would connect to TW's Leedy Lateral, this gas goes to Ivanhoe Dehy. then routes to Bushton processing.  All of our lines are mainlines; however, it is fair to say that the Leedy Lateral gas quality can be compared to that of gathering gas quality (dehydration is required).  The capacity at the Ivanhoe dehy needs to be checked to see if additional capacity would be available for the quantity that you have in mind.

Pressure:  MAOP of Leedy Lateral varies from 1125 to 1200 psi.  Operating pressures in the past year have been between 650 and 950 psig.

Cost: Approximate 4 on 16 hot tap costs would be between $60-75K.  We can price measuring/regulating facilities when expected volume is provided to Planning.

"Question about Christian Kvorning","
Martina,

Howdy from Texas.

I am writing to see if you know where Christian has landed since the reorg. of EBS.  I'm glad to see you still have an Enron address.  

I was telling a friend about our trip to Denmark and that museum that we saw there.  

Please let me know if you know where Christian is.

Hope all is well,

Mark
