"USGT K# 27161","
	Here's what I've found out from Dennis Lee.  USGT requested a realignment of delivery capacity back in June (it was also sent to them in June).  They held onto the request until a few weeks ago when they signed and returned the amendment.  Dennis found where the capacity was disapproved by Perry Frazier but, for an as yet unknown reason, Michelle Cormier tendered this amendment to them.  The changes have been activated in the TW contract system; however, we have not signed/returned the amendment and they have not nominated these changes.  Dennis says they switch these DP's frequently and would ""probably"" be agreeable to switch 6,000/d of their capacity (which was suggested by Perry in his denial of capacity) upon our request.  As you're aware, Michelle has changed jobs since this incident and this amendment was tendered prior to our re-implemention of the routing process.  I'll get you the file and associated papers as soon as Dennis has completed his examination. Our Tariff does stipulate that an amendment, not returned within 30 days, is null and void.  Since we did not sign and return the amendment, we could just say it ""timed out""...  just a thought.

"Halloween","                                10 Reasons Why Trick or Treating is better than Sex

10)  You are guaranteed to get at least a little something in the sack.

9)  If you get tired, you can wait 10 minutes and go at it again.

8)  The uglier you look, the easier it is to get some.

7)  You don't have to compliment the person that gives you some.

6)  It's ok when the person you're with fantasizes you're someone else because you are.

5)  20 years from now you'll still enjoy candy.

4)  If you don't like what you get, you can always go next door.

3)  It doesn't matter if the kids hear you moaning and groaning.

2)  Less guilt the morning after.

 ***And the #1  reason why Trick or Treating is better than Sex***
 
1)  YOU CAN DO THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD!

Air raids

America's war against terrorism seemed to enter a new phase after details were released of a raid by airborne forces on a target inside Afghanistan, though expected follow-up attacks did not materialise. Air raids on the country continued: Taliban spokesmen claimed many civilian casualties. America admitted that some ""collateral damage"" may have occurred.

See article: Fighting terrorism <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31724_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4d>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>


More anthrax

	
	 Reuters <http://www.economist.com/images/20011027/4301WW1.jpg>	
	
	
	

Two Washington postal workers, from the office that handled the contaminated letter sent to Tom Daschle, the Senate majority leader, died from inhalation anthrax, the most deadly form of the disease. Several other workers from the same office were suspected of having the disease, as was a worker from a sorting office in Trenton, New Jersey. Mass testing of postal workers began in Washington, DC, New Jersey and New York.

See article: Coping with the anthrax outbreak <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31723_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4c>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Anthrax spores were also found in a military building that handles mail addressed to the White House. John Potter, the postmaster-general, said he could not guarantee that any American mail was safe.

See article: The postal service's troubles <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31722_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4b> 

Canada relented after threatening to circumvent a patent on Cipro, an antibiotic for the treatment of anthrax, and obtain supplies from a generic-drug company. Bayer, Cipro's maker, agreed to provide as much of the drug as Canada needed to allay public fears. The United States threatened to override the patent if Bayer did not drop its prices-which it then did.

See article: Patents, anthrax and antibiotics <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31721_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4a>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

The House of Representatives approved the president's anti-terrorism measures, which will now be taken up by the Senate.


Israel defiant

In a ferocious week-long assault that claimed more than 40 Palestinian lives, Israeli tanks and infantry reoccupied parts of six Palestinian-controlled cities. The declared aim was to arrest militants, including the group that killed an Israeli minister last week. America brusquely demanded that the tanks be withdrawn. The Israelis took their time.

See article: Pull back the tanks, says Bush to Sharon <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31729_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_52>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

After militants in central Nigeria killed 19 soldiers, armed men in civilian clothing attacked four villages, killing some 200 people. The army denied responsibility. Renegade soldiers are suspected.

A group of Commonwealth ministers visited Zimbabwe to investigate whether the government had acted on promises, made last month at a meeting in Nigeria, to end farm invasions and restore the rule of law. Few expected them to come up with a positive answer. Amnesty International reported that government-backed murders were increasing.

A South African mob attacked hundreds of Zimbabwean immigrants living in shacks near Johannesburg, accusing them of stealing jobs, and of various crimes. Hostility towards Zimbabweans has been rising across the country.


The fatal shore

At least 350 people, mostly Iraqi asylum-seekers, died when their overladen boat sank after leaving Indonesia bound for Australia. Australia said it had identified an Egyptian in Jakarta who had organised the voyage.

Thirteen people died in shooting incidents in Indian Kashmir, bringing to at least 150 the toll since militant protest flared after America started bombing Afghanistan. In a separate development, 20 Pakistanis training in Afghanistan for operations in Kashmir were reported killed by American bombs.


Innocent and guilty

Under heavy pressure from America and its own political wing, the Provisional (ie, mainstream) IRA began putting some of its weapons ""beyond use"". No details or numbers, but Northern Ireland's first minister, David Trimble, gave the news a hearty welcome.

See article: The IRA has put the peace process back on track <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31728_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_51>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Britain's government eased the country's drug laws. Possessing small amounts of cannabis will no longer result in arrest and medicinal use is likely to be sanctioned.

Italy's final appeals court cleared the prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, of involvement in bribing tax inspectors dealing with three companies in his Fininvest group. However, the court found several Fininvest managers guilty for their role in the bribery.

In Berlin, the Democratic Socialists-heirs of the communists who ran East Germany for the Russians-took 23% of the vote in the election for a new state administration.

Macedonia's official police began patrolling areas formerly controlled by ethnic-Albanian guerrillas. Hardly had they left one village than its police station was blown up. Bad news for the peace deal, still not put into law by the parliament.

See article: A bombshell in Macedonia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31732_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4c>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

In Galicia, Spain's north-western province, over 50% of the vote in a regional election went to the governing People's Party, ensuring a fourth consecutive term as premier for its leader, Manuel Fraga.

See article: Charlemagne: Manuel Fraga, premier of Galicia <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31731_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4b>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

Two trucks crashed head-on and caught fire in Switzerland's St Gotthard road tunnel. Ten people died and more than 80 are still missing.


Swap or default?

Domingo Cavallo, Argentina's economy minister, made an unannounced visit to New York, apparently to try to persuade bankers of the virtues of a debt swap that rating agencies say may amount to a default. The government held back planned economic measures, after talks with provincial governors over budget cuts dragged on.

After 30 years of debate, Mexico's transport ministry at last decided on the site for a new international airport for Mexico city. It will be built on the dried-up bed of Lake Texcoco. The city's mayor said he would challenge the decision in the courts.

See article: Mexico's overdue new airport <http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_31734_6557507_2_80065724_60423391_1_4e>  E+ <http://www.economist.com/images/dingbats/e5.gif>

A leading human-rights lawyer was murdered in Mexico. Investigators suspected the army of being behind her death.

"HABITAT NEWS","St. Paul???s United Methodist Church 
Habitat for Humanity Project
  
November 19, 2001
  
OK, so maybe I was a bit optimistic . . . The work on the siding and soffits 
went very slowly, the plumbing was not completed, the paint for the second 
exterior coat did not arrive and the landscaping has been delayed.  According 
to Will Greenough, our construction manager from Habitat, his anticipated 
completion date of December 15 has slipped again to as late as mid January.  
Much of the delay is attributable to complications arising from the concrete 
construction, which made otherwise simple jobs very time consuming.  You 
should have seen the plumbers trying to drill through ten-inch concrete walls!
 
What all this means for us is that we have at least two more weekends of 
work.  If you are free on either November 24 or December 1, or both, please 
come out.  All of us find ourselves in the middle of crowded schedules this 
time of year, so anyone who can make the time to help, even for a half day, 
is very welcome.  We will continue on the siding and soffits, repainting and 
landscaping.  The going is slow, but the house can't be completed without it. 
 Let me know if you will be there so we can plan for food and drink.  We 
won't have van service on November 24, but we can arrange car pools from the 
church if there is any interest.
 
Thanks again to Ken Jones and Martha Cochrum for keeping us well fed.  Also 
to Jeanne Koch for keeping us safe (and not falling off the ladder) and to 
???chainsaw Felker??? for not cutting anything but the trees.  Also to Allene 
Ford for her example of boundless energy and to our crew chiefs, including 
Bob Mahlstedt and Roger Fowler, for getting the job done.  Our site is full 
of the sense of warmth and family that makes St. Paul's such a special place 
for worship. For that, thank you all.
 
If you would like to help in acquiring the washer and dryer for the Franco???s, 
please make a check out to St. Paul???s and indicate that it is for Habitat on 
the memo line.  We received several generous gifts already to make this a 
reality.  You can either give the check to me or send it directly to the 
church.  I will send additional information on the dedication as we get 
closer.
 
Thank you all for your dedication.  If any of you have questions or comments, 
please feel free to respond by return email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!

"Resume Update","Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be

  Upon receipt of a notice to exercise ROFR, you must determine the criteria of when the notice is required,  In the example provided I'm told it required a one year notice therefore if the contract terminated 10/31/02, notice was due 10/31/01.  Therefore 10 days after 10/31/01 the capacity must be posted for bidding.  In the interim, since it has not yet been posted a transaction could be negotiated and the shipper would then be required to provide notice of resinding the original election to participate in the Rofr process.  If this isn't clear, please call    MK

"Transwestern Capacity Release Report - 10/2001","Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides information for October 2001 invoicing.  The spreads to the California border narrowed during the month of October.  Therefore, two of the three index-based packages released by PG&E (Core) are below TW's max tariff rate and the third should be billed using the floor defined on the offer ($0.4455/dth), which does exceed the max tariff rate.
If you have questions or need additional information, please let me know.

Your objectives will need to outline your specific marketing plan for each customer, project and idea you may have for adding/increasing value to Transwestern in 2002.  As discussed earlier, we will get together in mid-December to review account loads to see if we need to do any shifting.  Your 2002 Objectives will be helpful in determining whether your load is heavy, light or just right.

"PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Lliine in Service and Files for 2003 Expansion","Note:  This quick expansion was the result of FERC's expedited permitting process.  Lorna  

 

PG&E Gas Transmission Puts New Line in Service, Files 2003 Expansion 
PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN) already has started deliveries through a 21-mile section of its 2002 mainline expansion project, and is making significant progress on proposed future expansions. The new 21-mile pipe section put into service last Friday increases the company's ability to deliver natural gas to western markets by 42,000 Dth/d a year earlier than expected and in time for the 2001 winter heating season. 
""We applaud the efforts of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to expedite the permitting process so that some of this new capacity could be in service before the winter heating season,"" said Thomas B. King, president and COO of PG&E National Energy Group's West Region, which includes subsidiary GTN. 
The new 42-inch pipe is in Spokane County, WA, and Kootenai County, ID, and represents the first installation of a third pipe, known as the C line, in GTN's mainline right of way. The new pipe became operational last Friday. GTN's 2002 Expansion Project also will include new 19,500 hp compressor units at five existing stations on the GTN mainline, which will increases its capacity by 220,000 Dth/d, mainly to serve power generation projects planned by Newport Northwest LLC and Calpine. Newport is developing a 1,300 MW generating plant near Wallula, WA, and two plants of similar size at other locations in the Pacific Northwest. Calpine has several generating projects in construction or development in the Pacific Northwest and California. 
GTN also has filed with FERC for a certificate to build a second expansion for service commencing in the fall of 2003. The proposed 2003 expansion project would add another 143,000 Dth/d beginning in the fall of 2003, plus an additional 20,000 Dth/d of winter-only service. The 2003 expansion project calls for an additional 53 miles of new C line pipe, plus the installation of one 19,500 hp compressor unit on the mainline system. Combined, the 2002 and 2003 expansion projects would put the total GTN capacity at nearly 3,100,000 Dth/d. 
""The 2002 and 2003 expansion projects will provide much-needed natural gas transmission capacity to supply electric generation projects already in construction or advanced development in California and the Pacific Northwest,"" King said. 
In addition, GTN is exploring the possibility of building a pipeline lateral from its mainline system near Spokane, WA, to the Interstate 5 corridor near Seattle/Tacoma. The company has been in discussions with potential shippers about the Washington lateral project since an open season was completed in June 2001.  ""There is clearly market interest in this project,"" King said. ""We have successfully completed much of the initial feasibility studies for the Washington lateral project and are ready to move to development when the market indicates it is ready."" 
The GTN system went into service on Dec. 2, 1961, with initial capacity of 580,000 Dth/d. The original system, inaugurated as Pacific Gas Transmission Co., consisted of one 36-inch pipe, the A line. The mainline system grew over the last four decades, first through the addition of a second pipe, the B line, measuring 42-inches, and now with the beginning of the C line. The system includes 1,356 miles of pipeline along a 612-mile route which begins at the Idaho/British Columbia border, traversing through northern Idaho, southeastern Washington and central Oregon, and terminates at the Oregon/California border, where it interconnects with the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. pipeline system and Tuscarora Gas Transmission.

Subject:	Rates Changes


Keep in mind that when you do amendments to move primary points around, the rate must be changed in CBS for the corresponding new paths.  Otherwise, CBS reflects  max rates.

It would also be helpful when a new contract is executed that the rate be put in CBS; otherwise, again CBS reflects max rates.

It is important to get these rates in CBS as the forecasting model pulls all rate information from CBS.  If CBS reflects max rates the revenues will be grossly over estimated.

Thanks for your help!

"NGI Article on TW Ruling","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : October 29, 2001
ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges 
A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009). 
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity. The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board. Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process."" 
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available. 
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said. Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.  The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff. 
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity. The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available. ""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power."" 
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options."" The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them. In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point. 
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Subject:	FW: SoCal - November 1 Changes

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the ""windowing"" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	OU-NU Locker Room Report: All is not lost
By James Hale

Date:	Oct 29, 2001

The streak is over, but the season isn't. James Hale talks with the 
Oklahoma coaches a day after their 20-10 to Nebraska
Make no bones about it, Oklahoma is not down and out over their loss to
Nebraska. Sure they disappointed, but Oklahoma is still Oklahoma and they
know that it took everything that Nebraska had to beat them on their home
field.
The Sooner coaches feel very good about how they played in the game.  They
knew going in that it was going to be incredibly tough to win the game in
Lincoln, but without question felt they could have done so. In fact, now
knowing what they know they felt they should have won the game.
The game was a tight fit, so it turned on a couple of plays. OU was very
confident and very much alive with 8:54 to play in the fourth quarter.  In
fact, OU Head Coach Bob Stoops was so confident in his defense that he
decided to pooch kick a punt from Tim Duncan down inside the five instead of
going for a 53-yard field goal. Now, hindsight is twenty-twenty, but Stoops
said he would do it again.
""Considering how we were playing defensively, I would probably pooch it
again,"" Stoops said Sunday afternoon following the game. ""Now that I know
what happened, I keep wrestling with that decision, but I like our defense
so much that I am sure that nine times out of ten I would pooch it down
there and tell our defense to go get the ball. I have a lot of confidence in
Tim (Duncan) and know that he can make a 53-yarder, but if he doesn't' we
lose field position and I just thought it was better we tried to pin them
down. Hey, give them credit, (Eric) Crouch makes a big play on the option
and then they beat us on the trick play. Things like that happen in a good
football game.""
Eric Crouch's 19-yard gain was a game-saver for the Huskers. Crouch was
totally held in check, before he finally breaks one off the right tackle to
get the Huskers off their goal line. However, at that point the Sooners were
still in good shape, before game-saver number two occurred.
""We have them stuffed right there at the Nebraska 32, but we get called for
the inadvertent facemask,"" said co-defensive coordinator Brent Venables.
""That is just a bad break on our part. We stuff the play, just like we had
stuffed him the whole game, but we get a penalty and they keep the drive
alive. We played great defense on that series. Think about it, we let them
off the goal line, but we hold our poise and stuff them the next three
downs. Bingo, we should be getting the football back with a little over five
minutes remaining in fairly good field position.  As it is, we get the
penalty and then get burned on the trick play.  That's football. But because
of the way it happened, we are not discouraged how we played at all.""
For 97 percent of the game, Oklahoma's defense was outstanding. Roy Williams
and Rocky Calmus were flying around the ball and Brandon Everage was doing a
great job in run and pass coverage. It took two Cornhuskers on most plays to
block freshman sensation Tommie Harris and in the fourth quarter, Harris was
stronger than any Husker offensive lineman.
Where the Sooners lost this game was in their lack of playmaking offensive
on offense and special teams. I can't believe I am saying the Sooners lost
this game on special teams, but on this rare occasion Nebraska had the
better special team play. 
""They made more plays than us in the end than we did and that made the
difference,"" said Stoops. ""We had our opportunities that we didn't come
through and convert on. The reverse pass is wide open and we have a chance
to go ahead 14-10, but again we throw a bad ball and don't convert. Then, we
had some drops in the second half and missed some opportunities for some big
plays on fade routes. We have come up with those kinds of receptions before,
however we weren't able to do it against Nebraska. I felt in the kicking
game that their punting game got the better of ours. When both teams punt 10
times there is a lot of exchanging there and I felt they had better field
position in the end.  That, coupled with two turnovers hurt us, because in
tight games that makes a difference. Again, they made more plays than us and
won the game.""
The lack of production out of the wide receivers continues to be the big
story offensively. Granted, the quarterbacking has been up and down, but if
the Sooner wide receivers played like they did a year ago, then the
quarterbacks would look a lot better. 
First, let me point out that nothing has changed at the Sooner practices.
The wide receivers catch the same amount of footballs that they caught last
year. Wide receiver coach Steve Spurrier Jr. is doing the same outstanding
job he did a year ago, and it is basically the same guys.
However, you have to factor in they lost of Andre Woolfolk and the fact that
Mark Clayton is the only wide receiver that is stepping up on a consistent
basis. Woolfolk did not play one snap on offense, but did an outstanding job
on defense. Clayton, once again played well coming up with 62 yards on six
catches. Norman also had a solid game with four catches for 48 yards.
However, where is Curtis Fagan and Antwone Savage?  Savage had two catches
for 35 yards, but both juniors are not getting open enough or making big
plays.
""We had some opportunities slip through our hands, literally slip through
our hands,"" said Offensive Coordinator Mark Mangino. ""It's obvious on the
plays that we are talking about that we had our hands on the ball and just
didn't haul them in. We are not asking our wide receivers to make any plays
they didn't' make last year, but right now we are not getting the same
production. However, let me point out that they are not totally problem. Our
quarterbacks are not always finding the right receiver in their progressions
and many times the quarterback is having a defender right in his face,
because our o-line didn't do a good enough job. It takes 11 guys to make an
offense work and 11 to break it down.""
At right tackle, the Sooners alternated Jerod Fields and Jammal Brown, and
both gave a solid account of themselves.
""They played right tackle by committee and I think we will keep it that
way,"" said Mangino. ""Both played well enough to give us a chance to have
success and that is about all we can hope for right now. Right now, both
can't play an entire game by themselves, so we are going to play both of
them and both have potential to be very good offensive linemen.""
Bob Stoops says that starting quarterback Jason White has a sprained knee
and that he will miss the Tulsa game, but he has a chance to be back for
Texas A&M. White was getting X-rayed Sunday and reports indicate that the
knee injury is a torn ACL and that White will attempt to play on it if he
can stand the pain. This situation is very similar to OU defensive back
Terrance Simms' knee injury that occurred early in the season. Simms
attempted to comeback after sitting out one game and and re-injured the knee
in the fourth quarter of his first game back, which has forced him to sit
out the rest of the season. What you hope is that there is nothing more to
White's knee injury and he can come back in two weeks. 
It's another opportunity for Nate Hybl to get something going at
quarterback. The coaches seemed pleased with Hybl's performance against
Nebraska and he did look good in the first half. In the second half, he
struggled against the Nebraska pressure and his wide receivers didn't catch
the ball on some nicely thrown fades. 
There is no question that the team has total confidence in White and they
would like to feel the same way about Hybl. For that to happen, Hybl needs
to deliver some big throws. 
Most of the national media at the game believes that OU and Nebraska are two
of the top four programs in the country. All believe that Florida and Miami
belong with the Big 12's top two big two. All believe that OU and Nebraska
will battle again in the Big 12 Championship game, and if the Sooners win
they will still have a great shot to play for the national championship.
The projected BCS poll tomorrow is Nebraska, Miami, OU and Florida with
Texas fifth.
One final point. Bob Stoops and his football team handled the loss with
great class. Stoops was great at the post-game press conference and won over
many national friends. He was intelligent, funny and right to the point with
his answers.
Mike Stoops, Brent Venables and Mark Mangino were the same. All were dressed
very well, handled themselves very well and were total class.  The Sooner
players answered every question, and despite the fact they were hurting
inside, really won over the national media.
This OU program is all about doing things the right away and that was 
never more evident than in their first loss in 20 games

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

"New AZ Storage Facility Open Season","Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

"RE: Resume Update","Mark,

Thanks for the quick response.  Yes, working in Europe has been a good
experience and certainly intellectually stimulating on many levels.
However, I'm probably not going to consult in 2002.  Not exactly my ""cup of
tea.""  It can be less than fulfilling coming in and out of projects and
never having the opportunity to actually start and finish an opportunity.
With that said, I am grateful for the experience and have definitely varied
my skill set as hopefully reflected in my resume.

I would imagine life at Enron has been challenging with the constant change
and bad press as of late.  I'm hopeful the worst is behind Enron and
smoother waters lie ahead.

Anyway, anything you can do for me in terms of getting my resume into the
right hands would be much appreciated.

Mark

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months,
I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately
capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this
year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy
assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.

Subject:	Columbia Gulf order on negotiated rates

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG""- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.

WE need to do a 12"" hot tap on the West Texas Loop line for the Agave
Interconnect.  This will be just north of the Atoka II junction.  I think we
can be ready for the hot tap by 11-20-01 based on when we should be
receiving materials.  The tap is to be in service by 12-1-01.  The pressure
at the time of the tap needs to be reduced to a maximum of 712 psig.  Is
there a good time to do the tap or a good time not to?  Attached is the
outage report.

Settlement discussions have hit the wall.  Conoco, the third of the Indicated Shippers the commercial group was going to talk to, cancelled their Friday meeting stating that their regulatory folks told them they shouldn't meet with Transwestern (Re: Negotiated Rate Proceeding) unless all of the indicated shippers were present... never mind the fact that TW had already met individually with BP/Amoco and Burlington.

Exceptions to the October 24, 2001 Initial Decision are due by Thursday, November 8, 2001.  TW will need to response with in seven days.  I have asked Steve Stojic, with the assistance of Maria, to circulate the first draft.

Habitat for Humanity Project
 
 November 26, 2001
 
 If you want to work on a Habitat house this year, next week should be your 
final chance.  Last Saturday, we completed the siding and soffits and most of 
the trim on our house.  What remains should go quickly on December 1 (just in 
time for Christmas shopping). The plumbing was also completed but the 
inspection did not taken place.  By next week, we should have the paint for 
the second exterior coat and the landscaping materials.  In addition, we will 
try to finish the siding, soffits and trim on the Dalferes house.  I asked 
again about interior and exterior doors and windows, but the project is so 
far behind, and the concrete construction requires such different techniques, 
that Habitat wants to wrap up the project with contractors.  From the 
Franco???s standpoint, that's probably a good thing.
 
Please let me know if you can help out on December 1.  Many of you have 
already called or written and I appreciate your diligence.  We will have so 
much to do this weekend, with jobs for all skill levels, that having a crowd 
would not be a hindrance. The landscaping and exterior painting will also be 
a great opportunity to get some more kids involved.  If you can help, even 
for a half day, you will be very welcome.  We will plan for food and drink 
again and the lunchtime party is worth the price of admission (Thanks Ken!).  
Also, please let me know if we will need van or car pool service. 
 
While you are considering your schedules, don't forget the dedication for the 
home when it is completed.  Once we know when the Franco???s can move in, we 
will schedule a get together with them to dedicate the house and hold an 
informal celebration.  Second, we will present a housewarming gift of a 
clothes washer and dryer through Habitat.  If you would like to help in 
acquiring the washer and dryer, please make a check out to St. Paul???s UMC and 
indicate ???Habitat??? on the memo line.  Finally, Habitat is planning to build 
50 homes next year, and has to complete 42 of them by September in order to 
meet the terms of the HUD loans used to acquire the land.  The homes will be 
of traditional frame and siding construction, and Habitat is gearing up for 
another intensive building program.  Please let me know if you are interested 
in participating in the build, and whether you want to assist in the planning.
 
If any of you have questions or comments, please feel free to respond by 
email or call me at 713-748-3317.
 
See you Saturday!

"Rates Changes","
Keep in mind that when you do amendments to move primary points around, the rate must be changed in CBS for the corresponding new paths.  Otherwise, CBS reflects  max rates.

It would also be helpful when a new contract is executed that the rate be put in CBS; otherwise, again CBS reflects max rates.

It is important to get these rates in CBS as the forecasting model pulls all rate information from CBS.  If CBS reflects max rates the revenues will be grossly over estimated.

Thanks for your help!

Title: Atlantic Basin Heating Oil Markets Well Supplied Before Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2800;


***********************************************************************

HIGH INVENTORIES AND WEAK JET DEMAND SHAPE THE HEATING OIL MARKET

Atlantic Basin heating oil markets are comfortably supplied in the lead-up to 
the winter 2001/02 heating season, and accordingly CERA expects much weaker 
distillate-to-crude price differentials than those of a year ago.

*  Primary distillate inventories in North America are well above those of a 
year ago, and German heating oil stocks are as much as 60 million barrels 
higher then last year.

*  Weakening jet fuel demand effectively increases availability of refinery 
distillate supply capability.

*  Distillate consumption in switchable applications in North America will be 
much lower than they were last year, when a very tight natural gas market 
boosted distillate demand.

"RE: what's up?","mark -

this is very surreal right now.  i am doing alot of dammage control in rac as you can imagine. it is an amazing learning experience, but it has been very stressful.  

erica is going to be done with enron by the end of december and then probably move back to d.c.  she is totally fine with this now expecially given the current environment at enron.

i am sure that andy is happy in denver.  it is a great place to live.

i'm doing ok.  i'm really looking forward to coming home for t-day and hangin' with the fam.

how are you doing at enron??

Pat,

Howdy!!!!

What is going on?  I heard from Erica that she may have some decisions to make soon.  Are you going through the same thing?  I'm interested to know.

I heard from Andy Maus last week.  He is doing some contract work for Enron.  He and his family are enjoying Denver.

Please call or email me.

I hope all is well.

"Transpecos","Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

"Additions to Data Request","Hi Mark,

I know we spoke about some of these things yesterday, but I thought I'd give you some specifics of the things we would look.  Many of these topics may be tied into the ""Accounting, Administration"" portion of the Word document you sent out.

Finance

- Loan documents* related to the debt financing of the project (especially any covenants or provisions in regard to the transferability of the debt under new ownership)
*If the debt is not specifically tied to this project, then it would be valuable to know what percentage of corporate debt they have allocated to the project.

- Book Value of the Assets 

- CapEx budget going forward (I saw that you already mentioned the need for historical CapEx numbers.)

- Depreciation Schedule of Assets

These are the issues that would be most important to us given all the other subjects that you have already address in your list.

Thanks,

Gabe Chavez

I haven't heard much about this project in the past few months.  Last time I was out there, Trigon Engineering wasn't sure where the project stood.  I'll get with Marketing to find out if this project is ""DEAD OR ALIVE"" and let you know.

Monthly Briefing 



Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Shift Toward Winter 	
URL(s):	

http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2748;


***********************************************************************

NATURAL GAS PRICES REBOUND AS HEATING SEASON APPROACHES

Despite high storage levels, with heating season coming, the Henry Hub cash 
market has bounced back from early October lows to levels near $2.40 per MMBtu. 
However, weak market fundamentals, including a sluggish economy and increased 
US and Canadian supplies, will mitigate the usual winter price rise. CERA 
expects an average Henry Hub price of $2.35 in November.

*  Although inventories are close to record levels, storage pressures are 
increasingly unlikely to drive cash markets down significantly this year. 

*  Gas demand will average 14 percent lower than a year earlier; residential 
and commercial sectors show a decline with a return to normal weather, while a 
weak economy offsets the return of ammonia and dual-fuel loads in the 
industrial sector.

*  Regional storage inventories and weak regional demand should keep upward 
pressure off of regional differentials. The Northeast examines security issues 
around LNG shipments.

"HABITAT NEWS","October 29, 2001 




Saturday was a glorious day weather wise.  Our volunteers turned up ready to complete the house if nothing came in our way.  Unfortunately, it seems the roof trusses are no longer constructed by Habitat volunteers, but rather manufactured by a contractor. Our trusses did not show up, so we finished putting the ""cap"" on our interior and exterior walls to prepare for the trusses next week, and then erected the trusses on our neighbor's house! 

The house next door is being built for the Espinoza family, and is known as the ""Anniversary House.""  Will and Linda Dalferes were looking for a unique way to celebrate their 25th anniversary: Why not build a house for Habitat for Humanity!?  The Dalferes sponsored the house and invited all their friends to come help build it.  The St. Paul's family can now count itself as ""friends of the Dalferes.""  Will and Linda asked me to convey their sincere appreciation for the help we provided this past week.  When you next work, please take a moment to get to know Will and Linda.   

Many thanks to Ken Jones and Martha Cochrum for the pizza last Saturday.  You have never seen pizza disappear so fast!  This Saturday is still in the planning stages.  One option you may want to consider is the BBQ wagon several doors down on Tangiers.  The gentleman there has been selling his beef, chicken and links at the same location for 45 years! 

If any of you have questions or comments, please feel free to respond by return email or to 713-748-3317.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, ""We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies."" 
Regent President John Ehrman said, ""The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease."" 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.
