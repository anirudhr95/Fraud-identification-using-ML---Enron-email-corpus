14:01 19Nov2001 RSF-INSIDE FERC: Midwest-Market 2: Lack of sellers forces high Enron bids - PGN311

Washington (Platts)--19Nov2001/301 pm EST/2001 GMT 

One trader said that she found arbitrage opportunities on some of the online platforms, capitalizing on a 5- to 6-ct differential between prices posted on EnronOnline and those on IntercontinentalExchange. She confirmed that few market players are willing to sell to Enron, which is forcing Enron to bid at a premium. 


Spot prices on ANR Pipeline in Oklahoma ranged from about $1.75/MMBtu early in the morning to about $2.36/MMBtu late, up from Friday's range of $1.38 to $1.58/MMBtu.

Hi Fletch,


	Thanks for returning my call and for taking the time to look over this
cover letter with attached resume.  I should be heading out to the driving
range one of these weeknights. Drop me line if you're interested?

I'm looking for a position on the Enron energy trading floor. The personal
and professional qualities that make me a successful mutual fund wholesaler
will make me a strong contributor to your trading team.
	As my resume reflects, I have plenty of analytical skills combined with
hands-on  fixed income and equity trading. I have consistently grown
business because I pay attention to details and thrive in a fast-paced
environment. My experience and success in developing business has come about
through learning quickly, planning ahead, and working well within a team
environment.
I would enjoy answering your questions, and discussing how my skills and
experience could contribute to your team. Thank you for your interest in my
application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,



Dac Calderhead

"RE: East Power","Mike,
 
I've talked with Kevin about adding another term-trading position position on my desk (TVA, the one we spoke about), and we're still not sure at this stage if that's the best place to allocate talent just yet.  For sure, when business is up to the level it was before the crash last year, that's definitely somewhere we'll need to add, but for right now we're still assessing.  As I said before, the dust is still settling (i.e. shuffling people and positions) so I still need a couple more days to see what the best fit for you might be.

Subject:	RE: Netting under ISDA

UBS will allow full and complete netting for all commodity derivatives done under and ISDA Master Agreement.  They will not allow netting of commodity transactions with other financial transactions (such as interest rate or f/x deals).  Unfortunately, the big limitation for us is that we will not be able to net between physical and financial exposures.  So transactions under an Enfolio physical gas master will not net with derivatives under an ISDA .

Mark,

I posed this question to Mark Haedicke last week and he suggested I ask you:  Will UBS allow counterparties that enter into an ISDA with UBS to net exposure between financial Gas and Power positions when calculating margin requirements?  If so, to what extent, and if not, why?  This would be a major selling point when we're trying to establish relationships with new trading partners and trying to build our financially traded products business.  Please help.  Thanks,

Lloyd, 

I was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.  My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?  It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.)  I talked to Rogers about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.  Let me know what you guys think...

I am hoping that you can help me with a confirm issue.  When CP&L is the
Seller and EPMI is the Buyer, the CP&L confirm people have been marking
through our Product description which says ""Into Cinergy, Seller's daily
Choice"" and putting ""Firm LD"" instead.  Now that we are confirming under
the EEI Master which defines both of these products, we would request
that your people not mark through the description.  Do you agree and an

As the ""head of whipping employees into submission"" on the United Way for EWS...just kidding.

Honestly, in the process of scanning the EWS employee list, I noticed that you hadn't had an opportunity to go online and make a pledge, yet.  So  thought I would pass the access information on to you again and encourage you to take a few minutes to go online and pledge.

To access the United Way system....

Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/ and complete your online pledge.  You will need your GIS ID, which is your ""9"" number not your ""P"" number and your password.  If you have never accessed global apps, then your password is your Date of Birth (Format is YYYYMMDD - i.e., June 9, 1962 is 19620609).

If you are still having difficulty, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click on ""Forgot your User ID or Password?""

Or, you can also call the HRGIM Help Desk at ext. 3-5666 for assistance.

If you don't have time to do it, send me an e-mail with your pledge amount and I will do it for you.  Then the system will send you a confirmation for your records.

EWS is way behind on participation and dollars contributed.  We need your help!

Thanks.

"Regional Research Projects","All,

The unofficial word on the street is that deal closing is slated for Feb 7 and UBSWenergy launch is Feb 11.  Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.  As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)  We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.

Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.  Therefore, I'd like each of you to fill-in the information listed on the attached document for the region listed by your name.  Feel free to use any resources you need (fundies, etc.) and have them finished by next Thurs. (2/7).  Someone please nominate yourself to format each paper in the same manner and have them all put together in one binder nice and pretty.  Have a goodie.

Subject:	NMC Term Sheet

Fletcher,

 I have attached a generic term sheet as a starting point for an opportunity we have discussed with Nuclear Management Company.  Any and all of these points included in the terms sheet are subject to change (in particular, the intra-day discussion).  

Background info on NMC is as follows: 

		Nuclear Management Company Llc (NMC)
	joint venture between -- NSP, Alliant, WEPCO and WPS
	services provided -- manage the companies (noted above) 7 nuclear facilities (5 sites)
	The Facilities are as follows:
Point Beach Units 1&2, owned by WEPCO, located in east central Wisconsin (30 miles SE of Green Bay), mW 523 and 500 mW respectively
Kewaunee, owned by WPS, located 27 miles SE of Green Bay, mW 511
Prarie Island Units 1&2, owned by NPS, located in Red Wing, MN, mW560 and 500 mW respectively
Monticello Unit 1, owned by NPS, located 30 miles NW of Minneapolis, mW 536
Duane Arnold, owned by Alliant (IES Utilities), located 8 miles NW of Cedar Rapids, mW 515
Michigan nuclear facility (no details)


They are looking for a physical hedge (they suggested a 600 mW gas fired peaking facility) but may be receptive to a financial hedge (especially for the Michigan site) as well.  Or, a combination.  I would like to explore leveraging the Arpin site if we could but at this time I want to hold off from mentioning the site since it is part owned by Great Rivers Energy.  They want ownership (percentage or all) of the gas fired facility.  Based on the geographic location of the facilities noted above, the Arpin site should work well.  I would imagine they have firm service for those sites and if they are looking for the gas fired facility to take up the slack when these units are out, we should not have a problem with transport from the Arpin site (even though there is a west to east issue).

They would also like to market the gas fired facility when the unit is not needed as a backstop!  From a physical plant standpoint -- I would suggest that we carve out the development with a slight ownership that has a put option (for the equity we retain) at a future date (but retain a percentage of the marketing arrangement for sale of excess power in the market).  I think NMC wants complete control based on their view of deregulation in Wisconsin.  I believe their long term strategy is to have a PPA with the above Utilities for the offtake (firm output w/ firm price) and the ability to market the excess (from both the Nuclear Units and peaking facility) at market rates. 

This arrangement should be able to flange well with a financial insurance product (since the addition of the gas fired facility would provide more liquidity) that I have discussed with the Mid-Market Group (Terri Clynes and Doug Sewell).

Let's arrange a time when we can discuss at your convenience.  Thanks, Ron.

Fletch - 

I got this forwarded from my mother (I'm betting the letter is fake) but it backs your idea of investing in online shopping.  What's better - the online stores or shipping services?

Deirdre


===================

Hi All,

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path.  This one,
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my

mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago.
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.  On 9/10, she
received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could
tell
her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that.  The part

worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
airlines
on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as everything
happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since turned over the
letter.

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. I may

be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings being correct

and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second and
wanted
to make sure that people I cared about had the same information that I did.

Shannon and I want to thank you for the great weekend at Del Lago.  We enjoyed it thoroughly.  It was nice to get to know and socialize with everyone and their families.

Put Russell down as 100%.  He's in San Antonio this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in Houston.  I talked to him last night and he had Jeannie Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m.  I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.  As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.  He's in either way.
 
 I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.
 
Did you receive a faxed signature copy from Carson yesterday/this a.m.?

Hi Fletch,


	Thanks for returning my call and for taking the time to look over this
cover letter with attached resume.  I should be heading out to the driving
range one of these weeknights. Drop me line if you're interested?

I'm looking for a position on the Enron energy trading floor. The personal
and professional qualities that make me a successful mutual fund wholesaler
will make me a strong contributor to your trading team.
	As my resume reflects, I have plenty of analytical skills combined with
hands-on  fixed income and equity trading. I have consistently grown
business because I pay attention to details and thrive in a fast-paced
environment. My experience and success in developing business has come about
through learning quickly, planning ahead, and working well within a team
environment.
I would enjoy answering your questions, and discussing how my skills and
experience could contribute to your team. Thank you for your interest in my
application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,



Dac Calderhead

Subject:	Market Info.

Just passing along some information from the Chicago office.  You may already know this, but here is what I have heard.

Peoples Energy/Dominion's Elwood plant is currently being inspected and repaired for cracks in the turbine blades.  The problem was explained to me as a result of a new blade grinding process being performed by a third party which has affected a large batch (potentially 153 units) of GE FA's (150MW's).  The Elwood plant is one of the first units to be inspected and repaired (Dominion had 2 units done prior to Elwood).  The inspection can be done on-site but involves removal and non-destructive testing of each blade (there are 92 blades in this section of the FA) and is subject to availability of replacement blades and trained personnel.  The Elwood plant has taken approximately one week working two twelve hour shifts.  One turbine required replacement of all blades.  GE is currently telling FA customers that they should conduct inspections at the customer's earliest convenience due to problems experienced in testing and through field verifications (Elwood).  They have not suggested any failure rates as a result of this problem.  I am assuming that most customers will choose to postpone inspections depending on the particular offtake structure.  

I will pass along any additional information I hear regarding this situation.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Gregg

Please find attached details for the forthcoming Enron Americas Management Offsite. There are group actions which need to be completed before arriving in Beaver Creek. 
The Offsite will involve meetings, mountain biking and white water rafting (grade 3), so please bring appropriate clothing. For those who have not been rafting before appropriate clothing would be swimwear, sports shoes, hat, shorts and T-shirt. Life jackets will be provided. The accommodation will be in condominiums in Beaver Creek and room assignments are also attached below. 
Transportation 
The attached agenda outlines the transportation requirements for those departing from Houston. It is assumed that all members of the ESA team will also travel to and from Houston with the Houston based employees. Dorie Hitchcock will be contacting those of you separately who are not traveling to and from Houston. 
Video 
You each have been assigned to a group for the sole purpose of completing a video prior to attending the Offsite. The video filming should be completed and on a VHS tape prior to departure for Beaver Creek. The purpose of this video is to provide a comic interlude to the proceedings. The videos will be seen prior to dinner on Friday night at Saddleridge. The video should be about  5 minutes in length, on a VHS tape and there is a zero budget assigned to the production of the video. Each team has been given a title which is open to interpretation (see attached spreadsheet).

I just forwarded the voice mail to your extension.  Basically, she indicated that there is no hard contract, that all of the terms and information are posted on the website and what you see is what you get.  I guess you could print out the terms from the website.  Let me know if you need me to research further.

Dwight,

I wanted to get an update from you on the status of your RFP process.
In our former discussion, you had indicated that we were short-listed
and that I would be receiving some additional information as far as next
steps.  I understood that the second phase would be happening within a
couple of weeks.  I just wanted to see where you were in your process at
this point.  Thanks.

As the ""head of whipping employees into submission"" on the United Way for EWS...just kidding.

Honestly, in the process of scanning the EWS employee list, I noticed that you hadn't had an opportunity to go online and make a pledge, yet.  So  thought I would pass the access information on to you again and encourage you to take a few minutes to go online and pledge.

To access the United Way system....

Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/ and complete your online pledge.  You will need your GIS ID, which is your ""9"" number not your ""P"" number and your password.  If you have never accessed global apps, then your password is your Date of Birth (Format is YYYYMMDD - i.e., June 9, 1962 is 19620609).

If you are still having difficulty, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click on ""Forgot your User ID or Password?""

Or, you can also call the HRGIM Help Desk at ext. 3-5666 for assistance.

If you don't have time to do it, send me an e-mail with your pledge amount and I will do it for you.  Then the system will send you a confirmation for your records.

EWS is way behind on participation and dollars contributed.  We need your help!

Thanks.

Eric

Reagan, Bill, Larry, and I got together to put together a draft business plan that can be applied to the Southeast and Midwest regions.  The schedule is probably aggressive, depending on when we get a power marketing license.  The plan is short on back end details until the eventual buyer is known, and until we know VAR, capital, etc.

From Kevin Presto:

Attached is the spreadsheet version of the template we discussed this morning.   I have added the additional columns everyone requested.   I would now like the business unit leads to fill in the blanks such that we have an initial Power Implementation Plan that can be delivered to Louise on Friday.
 
With respect to East Power (I am out Thursday and Friday), I am delegating to all of my desk heads the responsibility the following:
1) Have all of the forms attached spreadsheet forms complete
2) A product offering sheet is added to the template.

Fletch & Dana - Please take the lead on creating the product offering list (physical and financial).  My recommendation is we put products out through 03 for all regions (financial and physical).   Obviously, the physical products will be contingent on receiving a power marketing license.

Cory and Don Baughman - Please take a crack at identifying all of the transmission service agreements we need for the East (Christi has started a list already).

The transmission agreement list attached can be used to prioritize or assign commercial people to transmission/pool agreements.  It is not correct on the timing under the pools, so don't rely on that column.

 

Please call me on my cell (713-856-3923) with any questions.

"Frank Morello","Good morning!

I talked with Frank's assistant yesterday (he was out all day) and she said that they can't send an adjuster out without first filing a claim.  To that end, she said it's generally not a good idea to file a claim (it goes on our record) unless we know there's damage.  So, she suggested that I have a roofer come out and look for possible hail damage and, if there is damage, provide us with his estimate for repair.  Then we should file a claim if need be.  So, I'm on the lookout for a roofer who will do that for us.  If you think we should use Joel, I'll call him.  But, I feel like he might not provide us with an unbiased opinion, if you know what I mean.  Talk to you later.  :)

"","Lloyd,

I was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.  My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?  It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.)  I talked to Rogers about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.  Let me know what you guys think...

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT 


Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

	50 MW = 32,000 MWhours (50 MW x 16 peak hrs x 5 peak days/wk x 8 wks = 32,000 MWh)

Honestly, in the process of scanning the EWS employee list, I noticed that you hadn't had an opportunity to go online and make a pledge, yet.  So  thought I would pass the access information on to you again and encourage you to take a few minutes to go online and pledge.

To access the United Way system....

Please click on https://hrglobal.enron.com/ and complete your online pledge.  You will need your GIS ID, which is your ""9"" number not your ""P"" number and your password.  If you have never accessed global apps, then your password is your Date of Birth (Format is YYYYMMDD - i.e., June 9, 1962 is 19620609).

If you are still having difficulty, please go to https://ehronline.enron.com, click the ""Accept"" button, and then click on ""Forgot your User ID or Password?""

Or, you can also call the HRGIM Help Desk at ext. 3-5666 for assistance.

If you don't have time to do it, send me an e-mail with your pledge amount and I will do it for you.  Then the system will send you a confirmation for your records.

EWS is way behind on participation and dollars contributed.  We need your help!

Interesting article below about Calpine and others' 0 coupon convertible bonds with put options - due April '02.  This is ugly.

RH

 
 
 
-------------------
 
 
 
Fortune  
November 26, 2001 
SECTION: FEATURES/TOXIC BONDS; Pg. 131 
LENGTH:  2242 words 
HEADLINE: Headed For A Fall; 
Companies issued special  zero-coupon bonds, assuming they'd never have to
pay them off. Now  shareholders could be on the hook for a $ 65 billion tab. 
BYLINE: Janice  Revell 
BODY: 
It was an irresistible proposition: Borrow  billions of dollars, 
pay no interest, reap millions in tax breaks, and then  wait for 
the debt to simply disappear. That was the promise of  
zero-coupon convertible bonds, and companies from Enron to 
Merrill Lynch  binged on what seemed like free money. 
But, of course, there was a  catch: For this scenario to play out, 
a company's stock price had to rise  sharply--and quickly. That's 
because investors bought the bonds in the hope  of converting them 
into equity--if the stock tanked, the bonds would no  longer be 
worth converting. So to make them more attractive to buyers,  
companies had to build in an escape hatch: If the stock price 
failed to  rise sufficiently, investors could ""put"" (that is, 
sell) the bonds back to  the company--in many cases, after just one 
year. 
And that's exactly  what's about to happen--to the tune of some 
$ 65 billion over the next three  years. Stock prices have fallen 
so far that for at least half of these  special hybrids, the 
prospect of conversion is now absurd. It simply won't  happen. So 
bondholders are looking to get their money back the first chance  
they can. And because of the put feature, that is possible. 
Suddenly  companies like Tyco, Comcast, and dozens more are on 
the hook for billions  of dollars in debt and interest they 
thought they'd never have to pay.  
That could be very bad news for shareholders of these companies.  
After all, they're the ones who are going to be picking up the 
tab when  all that debt comes due. Huge chunks of cash will 
disappear from balance  sheets to repay bondholders. Companies 
without enough cash--and the majority  fall into this camp--are 
likely to face skyrocketing interest charges when  they borrow 
money anew. That means sharply reduced earnings. Especially at  
risk are investors in companies with poor credit ratings--prime  
candidates for killer refinancing costs. Some companies may even 
be  forced to issue stock to pay off the debt, creating 
significant shareholder  dilution, especially at current 
depressed prices. To make matters worse,  this is happening at a 
time when the economy is barreling downhill and  corporate 
profits are already shrinking. ""This is a ticking time bomb,""  
warns Margaret Patel, manager of the Pioneer High Yield Bond 
fund, a  top-performing junk fund. 
The seeds of this mess were sown in mid-2000,  when the stock 
market started to falter. Companies in search of capital  balked 
at the thought of selling stock while their share prices were  
struggling. Zero-coupon convertible bonds presented an 
attractive  alternative because companies didn't have to make 
cash interest payments on  the bonds (hence the name ""zero""). 
Instead issuers offered an up-front  discount--for instance, 
investors would buy a bond for $ 700 and collect $  1,000 when it 
matured. 
Companies also gave investors the right to  convert the bonds 
into a fixed number of common shares. But the bonds were  
structured so that conversion would make sense only if the stock 
price  rose significantly--in many cases, by more than 50%. With 
that protective  feature (called the conversion premium), zeros 
took off. Corporate issuers  would pay no interest, and once 
their stock prices had climbed back to  acceptable levels, the 
debt would be swept away into equity. ""If the bonds  are 
converted, it's a home run for everybody,"" says Jonathan Cohen, 
vice  president of convertible-bond analysis at Deutsche Bank. 
That  four-bagger, of course, depends entirely on the stock price 
rising. If it  doesn't, the bondholders, armed with that handy 
put feature, can simply sell  the bonds back to the company. 
Great for bondholders, but not so hot for the  company or its 
shareholders. But, hey, what are the odds of that happening?  
""CFOs and CEOs believe that their stock will just continue to go 
up,""  says Cohen. ""They don't worry about the bond getting put."" 
If all this  seems a little complicated, that's because it is. A 
real-life example should  help. California-based electric utility 
Calpine issued $ 1 billion in zeros  in April to refinance 
existing debt. At the time, the company's stock was  trading at 
about $ 55 a share--severely undervalued in the opinion of  
company management. ""We really didn't want to sell equity at 
that  point,"" says Bob Kelly, Calpine's senior vice president of 
finance. So the  company instead opted to sell zeros, setting the 
conversion premium at a  hefty 37%. 
Still, with no cash interest payments and a stock price that  had 
to rise significantly to make conversion worthwhile, the bonds  
weren't exactly a screaming buy for investors. So Calpine added 
the put  feature: Investors could sell the bonds back to the 
company after one year  at the full purchase price, eliminating 
any downside risk. 
Things  haven't exactly worked out as management had hoped. The 
stock has since  plummeted to $ 25, and it now has to triple 
before conversion makes sense.  So it's looking as though Calpine 
will be liable for the $ 1 billion in  borrowed money when 
investors get the chance to put the bonds this April.  There's 
also the refinancing cost. According to Kelly, Calpine's  
borrowing rate could run in the neighborhood of 8.5%--an extra 
$ 85  million per year in cash. ""Obviously, nobody plans for their 
stock to go  down,"" Kelly says. ""I don't think there was one 
person around who thought  the bond would be put."" 
Calpine's potential costs are particularly high  because its 
credit rating is straddling junk. ""If you are a borderline  
investment-grade company, a financing of this nature is not 
necessarily  the most appropriate thing in the world,"" notes 
Anand Iyer, head of global  convertible research at Morgan 
Stanley. The problem is, there are a slew of  companies with far 
worse credit ratings out there: Jeff Seidel, Credit  Suisse First 
Boston's head of convertible-bond research, estimates that  about 
half of all zeros outstanding fall into the junk category. And  
others are at risk of having their ratings downgraded before the 
put  date. Today, with junk yielding as much as 5 1/2 percentage 
points above  bonds rated investment grade, refinancing can be a 
pricey proposition.  
Contract manufacturer Solectron is one that could well get hit 
by  the high price of junk. It has $ 845 million in zeros that it 
will probably  have to buy back this January, and another $ 4.2 
billion coming down the  pike over the next couple of years. 
Because of slower-than-expected sales,  the company was recently 
put on negative credit watch by three rating  agencies. And if 
Solectron's credit is downgraded, the zeros would slide  into 
junk status, a situation that could cost the company--and its  
shareholders--tens of millions of dollars in refinancing charges.  
Refinancing isn't the only worrisome cost associated with these  
zeros. Companies pay hefty investment banking fees to sell their  
bonds--up to 3% of the amount raised. If the debt is sold back, 
many  will have spent millions for what essentially amounted to a 
one-year loan.  ""They're getting bad advice,"" claims one banker 
who didn't want to be named.  ""Look at the fee the banker earned 
and look at the kind of financing risk  the company got into."" 
As if those potential consequences were not scary  enough, 
shareholders can also get whacked when the bonds are first  
issued. That's because some 40% are bought by hedge funds, which 
short  the company's stock (sell borrowed shares with the 
intention of buying them  back at a lower price) at the same time 
that they buy the bonds. If the  stock goes down, the shorts make 
money from their position. If it goes up,  they profit by 
converting the bond to stock. This hedging strategy almost  
always causes the stock to plummet, at least for a while. 
Grocery chain  Supervalu, for example, recently lost 10% of its 
market cap the day it  announced it was issuing $ 185 million in 
zeros. 
Despite all the  pitfalls, the love affair with such Pollyanna 
bonds continues, thanks in  large part to the slick tax and 
accounting loopholes they provide. In fact,  the hit on earnings 
per share can be the lowest of any form of financing.  Even 
better, thanks to a wrinkle in the tax code, companies can rake 
in  huge tax savings by deducting far more interest than they're 
actually  paying. All they have to do is agree to pay small 
amounts of interest if  certain conditions prevail. Verizon 
Communications, for instance, would pay  0.25% annual interest on 
its $ 3 billion in zero bonds if its stock price  falls below 60% 
of the issue's conversion price. In the eyes of the IRS,  oddly, 
that clause enables the company to take a yearly interest  
deduction, for tax purposes, of 7.5%--the same rate it pays on 
its  regular debt. (Why? Trust us, you don't want to know.) That 
adds up to an  annual deduction of more than $ 200 million, even 
if Verizon never shells  out a dime in interest. Not 
surprisingly, more than half of the zeros issued  in 2001 contain 
similar clauses. ""It's an incredible deal for them,"" says  Vadim 
Iosilevich, who runs a hedge fund at Alexandra Investment  
Management. ""Not only are they raising cheap money, they're also 
doing  tax arbitrage."" 
So despite the enormous risks to shareholders, companies  
continue to issue zeros at a steady clip: According to 
ConvertBond.com,  seven new issues, totaling $ 3.5 billion, have 
been sold since Oct. 1 alone.  ""I think the power of the tax 
advantage is going to keep them around,"" says  CSFB's Seidel. 
Call it greed or just blind optimism that the markets will  
recover quickly--it doesn't really matter. Either way, it's the  
shareholders who'll be left paying the bill.
