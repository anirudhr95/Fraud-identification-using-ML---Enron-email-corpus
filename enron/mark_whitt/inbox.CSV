"RE: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project","Mark,
	I am assuming we are on for this coming Tuesday given the exchange of e-mail.  I am planning to arrive in Denver by 11:00 and will be going on to Seattle on Tuesday evening.  Where do we meet you?  How long will the meeting go.  I have held off ticketing to until I had some details.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

                                       For a perfect mix of performance, sound and looks in a cat back exhaust system, this is it. Corsa's patented Power Pulse RSCTM (Reflective Sound Cancellation) technology uses sound waves to enhance the throaty LS1 power pulses and eliminate exhaust drone and interior resonance. The Touring Edition provides a crisp, exotic car sound with a whisper quiet cruise note. The Pace Car Edition has a broader, more aggressive tone at full throttle.  Exhaust systems are hand built of 316L stainless steel and feature a 2 1/2 straight through muffler design to increase flow 45% over the stock system.

Along with FREE SHIPPING, Zip Products has some great November specials on Corsa Exhaust Systems and Cross-Over Pipes.

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax.  Read Ken Lay - Honest Man.  Apparently overstating earnings and misstating financials for years while at the same time exercising options and making yourself over $100 million is a sign of virtue.

"Crestone/Bear Paw packet","Gents--

Hopefully, I've attached a general information packet below for the Calgary office &/or Suncor.

[One note: we've rolled the original (overvalued by T-Bone) CGS assets into Bear Paw, so that's why you don't see a reference to CGS (fomerly EMS) anymore.]

Thanks.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

I was looking for companies to approach about employment and Burlington Resources name came up.  I assume Lee Hanse is still with them. I was going to send him an e-mail with my resume.  Any thoughts about BR.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Did you see it?  The article entitled 
""HOW ENRON BLEW IT""
Enron's Cutthroat Culture (on the cover)
Texas Monthly, November 2001 By Mimi Swartz

For Houston's sake as the Energy Capital, we hope the best for Enron as it
turns this thing around.
Attached is the article and below is the link and an excerpt.

INTRO EXCERPT
The Houston-based energy giant put the pursuit of profits ahead of all other
corporate goals, which fostered a climate of workaholism and paranoia.  And
that was only part of the problem.  (from the table of contents).

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything:
money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the
most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, Wall Street is
bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

Subject:	Income Tax Issue

Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment ""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some ""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

"RE: Rent Check","I talked to Susan Helton yesterday and she is still trying to track down the rent.  She said she isn't seeing it on a ""paid invoices"" list so she's still trying to get it resolved.  She said it would probably be after Jan. 2nd since so many people are out of the office until then.
 
I haven't seen Todd or Wayne and I didn't see an invoice on my desk from them.

"San Juan Proposal","Mark,
Help me out here!
I took our current marketing arrangements, selling into the spot
market, assuming the worst at EPNG-SJ Index - $0.10, and compared it to
the pricing under the three tranches.  I realize we are mixing IF and
GDA, but IF can be swapped for GDA and vice-versa in the swing swap
market.  My dilemma is that the firm transportation does not appear to
be accretive, in fact it results in $0.05 / mmbtu  less than current
arrangement (accross the total volume).  What is really killing it is
the NW basis and discount...am I using the right one?  (FYI, I used
ENA's mid-market basis for the 12-month strip going forward).  What am I
missing here?

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

America's Tragedy: TLU Responds

 

Alumni Reports - On behalf of TLU and its alumni, staff members have been calling and sending e-mail messages to alumni and friends of TLU who live in New York City and the District of Columbia or who grew up in these regions. As of today, Friday, Sept. 27, we have not heard of any deaths or missing people among those whom we have attempted to call.

 If you hear word of alumni, friends or other members of the TLU community who have been affected by the Sept. 11 tragedy, please e-mail alumni@tlu.edu <mailto:alumni@tlu.edu> or call 830-372-8020 so that we can send cards and spread the word to alumni and the campus. Thank you.

 First-hand Account - Douglas Rosa, 88G, works as the vice president in the Controller's Division of Deutsche Bank, Manhattan branch. The bank's offices are located some 150 feet from the World Trade Center in downtown NYC. Rosa and his family are shaken, but fine. A first-hand account of Rosa's experience on Sept. 11 follows.

 Having worked some 150 feet from the World Trade Center Tower 2, Sept. 11, 2001 was a day unlike any other in my life. I arrived at work approximately 6:20 a.m. and before entering my Deutsche Bank building at 130 Liberty St. (on the south side of the WTC #2 Tower and connected by a walking bridge), I purchased a package of six apple cider donuts from the Farmers Market that, just like any other Tuesday or Thursday, was setting up shop outside WTC #5.

 At approximately 8:50 a.m., I called my wife, Dorothy, home in Caldwell, NJ, from my office on the east side of the 21st floor, to tell her that our building just shook and that there was a large noise - as if a plane had crashed some place near by. 

 After hanging up, I was told a plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. I looked out my window and saw people running for their lives. There were cars on fire and debris flying everywhere. Our building was getting hit with pieces of the debris, and it sounded like a major hailstorm. We could see this remarkable amount of flame and smoke coming from the hole in Tower 1. I screamed to my co-workers to get away from the windows. At that point, many of us gathered our bags, and began walking down the stairs. As we reached the 7th floor, an announcement was made to stay on our floors, not to evacuate. Knowing that it looked pretty dangerous outside, we went back to floor 21. 

 Then another crash came, bigger than the first one. Someone began screaming, ""Run, it's coming down.""  We all ran to the south side of the floor and waited for the next announcement. When it was finally made, they began evacuating floors 1-7. We waited some more. Everyone was shaking from nervousness. 

 Then they announced that everyone (all 41 floors) should evacuate as soon as possible and to use the elevator if needed. We began our descent quickly and orderly.

 As we reached the second floor lobby, we were told to exit the building and head south. And so we did. I headed 10 blocks south to Battery Park and began looking for ways to travel back to New Jersey. People told us that the ferries were still leaving from the World Financial Center, directly west from the WTC, so a co-worker and I began walking north along the Hudson River walkway, through Battery Park. As we approached the ferry dock, everyone around just screamed and began running for cover. I ran straight for the Hudson River and never looked back.

  I jumped over the barrier wall and stood there watching as this mushroom cloud of dust kept chasing me. I decided in my own mind to jump in the water if it reached me. Finally, though, it just stopped coming. Needless to say, the ferry never reached the dock. Tower 2 had fallen, and most of us never even realized that it was no longer up there somewhere behind the smoke and dust. Then the radio confirmed it, and we also heard about the attack on the Pentagon.

 Feverishly, the police directed us further north. As we continued on the sidewalk surrounded by all-glass towers, we were all very nervous. People listened on their walkmans and desperately tried to use their cell phones to reach loved ones. I stopped for an instant to lead a blind woman with a young girl to a policeman. 

 Although everyone was nervous, most people kept walking in an orderly fashion without pushing. We continued up the West Side Highway when, suddenly, the Tower 1 gave way. I turned to watch, but quickly turned away and walked even faster. People dropped to their knees to pray. Eventually, I reached another ferry terminal. I waited an hour and a half in line and borrowed several cell phones to call my wife. I never got through to her until I reached New Jersey, though.

  Before I got home that night, I walked and ran a lot more. I even found myself in the middle of a bomb scare inside the Hoboken Train Terminal. I ran to Jersey City and spent the late afternoon hours with my cousin, Sr. Lilian Silkowski, a Roman Catholic nun that lives in Jersey City. I was told that two of her students, siblings, in the parish's high school had lost both their mom and dad. That's when it hit me how many lives had been affected. The parents worked in the upper floors of the WTC. Several other students have been taken out of school because their parents were employed in the WTC and have since lost their jobs, and they can no longer afford the tuition.

When I arrived home at 8 p.m. that evening, I kissed my wife and my kids. I thanked God for getting me home safe. 

 As I watch TV, I realize how much danger I was in and thank God for looking after me. The experience has reminded me of all my friends and family. Although we don't always talk, we are connected. Among them are many of my TLU family. My wife and I have been getting phone calls from all of you. From Texas to Chicago to Phoenix to Connecticut to Virginia and South Carolina. Thank you to Gary, Angelique, Kim, Steve, Debbie, Becky, Chris, Mike, Andrew, Shirley, Charlie, Lana, Kim, Alex, Kris, etc. You are my family. It's nice to be able to say that your phone is ""ringing over"" from love and support. Thank you all for your prayers and thoughts. I truly believe that they made the difference for me that day.

 For those TLU alumni that are looking for ways to help, may I suggest the following. The families in my cousin's school listed above have many challenges ahead. The school has begun a fund for the two siblings who lost both parents, and the address is as follows: St. Mary's High School WTF Fund, 209 Third St., Jersey City, NJ 07302 attn. Sr. Jacqueline Carey.

 God bless the TLU family and God bless America.

Alumni Event Reports

 

Women of TLU Reports 

 

San Antonio Women of TLU- The San Antonio Women of TLU met Sept. 8 at the San Antonio Country Club to discuss ""Kneading the Dough: Women, Faith, and Financial Resources."" Dr. Annette Citzler, professor of economics and business administration, was the guest speaker. This event went very well, with approximately 30 women in attendance. Citzler discussed how and why women tend to be more averse to risk and how to move into the future with a better understanding of our finances. 

 

Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU - The Dallas/Fort Worth Women of TLU held their founding meeting Sept. 22 at the home of Marion Brekken, wife of Board of Regent Dr. Alvin Brekken. This Women of TLU brunch, at which President Jon N. Moline spoke, was a great success! There were about 30 women in attendance, and since this was their first meeting, there was a great amount of discussion and many ideas were brought up for future meetings. All the Dallas/Fort Worth-area women are excited to have this group in their area and look forward to their next meeting in the spring.

 

Houston Women of TLU - The Houston Women of TLU will meet at 1 p.m. Friday, Oct. 5, for a tour of Rienzi, the former home of Carroll and Harris Masterson. Rienzi is now the Center for European Decorative Arts at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The day will end with coffee and dessert at Europa Caf?. 

 

Austin Women of TLU - The Austin Women of TLU will meet at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, at the Lakewood Club House. Speaker Ramona Magid from Komen Austin will lead discussion on the topic ""Breast Cancer: Helping Yourself, Helping Others.""

 

Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU - If you are a member of the Seguin-New Braunfels Women of TLU organization, please note that the program for the Oct. 6 event has changed. Author Janice Woods Windle, who was scheduled to speak, has unfortunately cancelled. Instead, however, a panel of alumnae will lead a discussion on America at War: A Woman's Perspective. The alums - Virginia Woods, 58G; Betty Jean Jones, 46G; Patt Linden, 60G; plus others - will be joined by a current TLU student. They will each give brief presentations of their own memories of times when America has been vulnerable - Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Korea and Oklahoma City - before opening the event up to general discussion with everyone in attendance. 

 

Our apologies about the change in program. We will be working to personally contact those of you who have RSVP'd over the next few days to talk to you about the change. The brunch will still begin at 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 6, in the Timmerman Room of Hein Dining Hall on campus.

On Campus

 

U.S. News Rankings - Texas Lutheran University has again been listed in this year's U.S. News & World Report college rankings as one of the best comprehensive colleges and the No. 1 value among comprehensive colleges in the Western United States. Among comprehensive undergraduate colleges in the Western United States, TLU was ranked third in overall quality and the No. 1 value. TLU is the highest-rated Texas college in its category. U.S. News has repeatedly recognized TLU as a top quality institution since the magazine began its rankings in 1983.

 This is the second year in a row TLU has been ranked No. 1 for value, posting numbers showing that 61 percent of its students receive grants based on need, with an average discount of 39 percent.

 A complete account of TLU's placement in the U.S. News & World Report rankings is in the Fall Torch, due in your mailbox in October.

 

Cultural Events Calendar - A vocal performance by a stellar soprano, an art exhibit featuring the works of four international women artists, the traditional Christmas Vespers, and a look at ""Scary Frontal Freakin' Skullheads"" are some of the highlights of the 2001-2002 cultural events calendar at Texas Lutheran University.

 A calendar of events has been sent to people on the university's arts mailing list. If you would like to receive a calendar, please call the TLU University Relations Office at 830-372-8020. To view it online, please click here:

 <http://www.tlu.edu/> and look under the ""Other Updates"" section for more information.

Enrollment Up - With official class rosters complete, Texas Lutheran University registered a total student enrollment of 1,473 for the 2001 fall semester. This growth continues a trend of increased enrollment at Texas Lutheran, which has grown steadily since the mid-1990s.

 Numbers show a record main-campus enrollment for TLU, with 1,358 students enrolled in courses on the main campus. Also, 1,257 of those students are full time enrollees - another record for the university.

 The university has set a strategic planning goal of 1,600 full-time students on the main Seguin campus. This number will preserve the university's community feeling, and allow for the small classes and personal attention that are the hallmark of a TLU education.

 This year's average class size is 21, and TLU maintains a 15.5 to 1 student/faculty ratio.

             Other details about the current TLU student body at the main campus:

?        92 percent us hail from Texas, though there are representatives from 25 other states and 16 countries, notably Minnesota and Arizona, as well as Japan and Macedonia.

?        A slight majority - just over 500 individuals - is majoring in disciplines in the TLU College of Professional Studies (business administration, education, kinesiology and social work). 

?        Traditional liberal arts majors offered in the College of Arts Humanities and Social Science (art, English studies, psychology, sociology, etc.) come in a close second, with 416 students majoring in those areas.

?        Almost 300 students have selected majors in the College of Natural Science and Mathematics (biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, physics etc.), and just over 200 are undecided.

"RE: <<Concur Expense Document>> - MW100901","Barry,

The Jackson Hole Lodging (Huff House) for Mark and Paul was all charged on Mark's card.  The way the lodging was broken up is as follows: 2 rooms, 2 night stay, $215.00 per night per room + 6% tax.  So, actual charges for Mark Whitt was $455.80, and for Paul Lucci was $455.80, for a grand total of $911.60.  

Paul has not given me his receipts from this trip just yet, but the only major travel associated charges he should have to expense would be airfare, which was $251.50. As Mark also had the rental car charged to his expenses.

Please let me know if you need anything further on this, or if you have questions.

Thanks,
Heidi

Heidi, Please sum up my costs and Paul's cost for this trip and forward to Barry.

Barry,  All of the Hotel costs were on my credit card, so all Paul should have is his airfare and incidentals.  But we will sum it up for you.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

"Lieberman Speaks Out on War Goals","
This is today's New Dem Daily (10/17/01) . Sen. Joe Lieberman is the 
immediate past  chair of the national DLC.   His speech is at 
http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=106&subid=122&contentid=3851.  Please 
let us know what you think.

Earlier this week, Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-CT) made a thoughtful speech about 
the success of New Democrats in reviving their party's traditional 
commitment to a ""foreign policy that was values-based and fully engaged, a 
defense policy that was muscular and modern, and an economic policy that 
was internationalist."" Indeed, Lieberman suggested that the Bush 
Administration has moved in a similar centrist direction in its 
impressively unifying response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 
eschewing its previous tendency towards unilateralism and a values-neutral 
""realism.""

But Lieberman made news in his address to the fall conference of the New 
Democrat Network by openly saying what many Americans have privately 
concluded during the last month: the logic of the President's 
well-articulated position on the scope of the war on terrorism means that 
we cannot necessarily limit military action to Afghanistan. In Lieberman's 
words, we must at some point become ""unyielding in our demands that 
countries like Syria and Iran end their support of terrorism before we will 
contemplate working with them."" Moreover, said Lieberman, ""it should make 
us unflinching in our determination to remove Saddam Hussein from power in 
Iraq before he, emboldened by September 11, strikes at us with weapons of 
mass destruction.""

Lieberman is one of the few elected officials from either party to publicly 
connect the dots between our proclaimed war on any form of terrorism ""with 
global reach,"" and the obvious existence of a Middle Eastern rogue state 
that is sponsoring terrorism, pursuing weapons of mass destruction, 
continuing to threaten its neighbors, and is dedicated to the elimination 
of the U.S. presence in the region -- much of it necessitated, of course, 
by Iraq's continued behavior. The President has eloquently and repeatedly 
said any country that is not on our side in the war on terrorism must be 
treated as a ""hostile power."" By any measure, Iraq is a supremely hostile 
power that shares every anti-American impulse of both Al Qaeda and the 
Taliban, while having far superior means for attacking us. How can Iraq 
possibly be treated as irrelevant to this struggle? How can we possibly 
demand that friendly regimes in the region decisively side with us, while 
we ignore Iraq?

Unfortunately, there have been several signals from the Administration that 
the U.S. might shrink from the broader task of fighting terrorism -- even 
to the extent of leaving elements of the Taliban in power in Afghanistan -- 
if the more immediate task of capturing or killing Osama bin Laden and 
other top leaders of Al Qaeda can be accomplished. The logic seems to be 
that removing the Taliban, much less Saddam Hussein, from power could 
create a dangerous ""power vacuum"" in those countries, while destabilizing 
the international coalition against terrorism. This line of argument is 
reminiscent of the reasoning behind the decision in 1991 to leave Hussein 
in power in Iraq, followed by an unsuccessful sanctions regime and the 
permanent stationing of U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region.

Whatever you think about that decision and its consequences, it's clear now 
that we cannot let excessive concern for political stability and 
coalition-building keep the United States from destroying the terrorist 
network and protecting our country from terrorist threats that continue 
every day. Surely we learned on September 11 that there are worse things in 
the world, and worse things in the Middle East, than ""power vacuums."" The 
Taliban, after all, was created in large part to bring order to 
Afghanistan, which led to its active sponsorship of violent disorder 
elsewhere, including our own country.

As for the anti-terrorist coalition, we should remember that coalitions are 
a means to an end, not ends in themselves. A coalition that cannot accept 
changes of regime in terrorist states, whether in Kabul or Baghdad, is not 
a terribly useful coalition to begin with. As Lieberman put it, ""if it 
becomes necessary, as we hope it will not, we could benefit from a dose of 
the Administration's previous preference for unilateralism."" As New 
Democrats have always argued, multilateralism is the preferred means in a 
post-Cold War world for the vindication of Americans' interests and values. 
But especially in the case of an attack on the United States itself, 
multilateralism should not become an excuse for inaction. Does this mean we 
have to go to war in Iraq? No, but it does mean the matter must remain open 
so long as the terrorist network still threatens us.

Non-military steps, including a different regime of ""smart sanctions"" that 
hit Saddam's thugs more than his already victimized citizenry, are 
possible. So, too, are military steps that could create truly autonomous 
Shiite and Kurdish regions in Iraq while leaving Saddam with a smaller 
domain. But the point to remember is this: we cannot treat the war on 
terrorism as a small skirmish in Afghanistan aimed solely at bin Laden and 
his closest associates. As Joe Lieberman rightly said: ""Our fundamental 
principles are at least as much on the line in this war against terrorism 
as they were in our battles with Nazism and Communism during the last century.""

Lieberman performed a valuable service in reminding Democrats of the 
heritage of tough-minded internationalism that characterized Democratic 
leaders like Truman and JFK during the post-World War II era. It's a 
heritage whose time has come once again.

"Cell Phones are turned off","Mark,
I'm sure you've already noticed this, but our cell phones have been disconnected.  

I thought maybe we could pay for the bill on a credit card and turn it in on an expense report. Susan Helton is trying to find someone to get guidance from as far as getting this bill paid.  She said in Houston they are no longer paying for parking or cell phones but she wasn't sure about satellite offices.  She would hate to see us not get our expense reports paid.

I'll keep you posted.

Date: Thursday, October 11, 2001 3:32:46 GMT
Subject: 



To My Dear Wife: 
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 

54 times the sheets were clean 
17 times it was too late 
49 times you were too tired 
20 times it was too hot 
15 times you pretended to be asleep 
22 times you had a headache 
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
16 times you said you were too sore 
12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
19 times you had to get up early 
9 times you said weren't in the mood 
7 times you were sunburned 
6 times you were watching the late show 
5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
9 times you said your mother would hear us 
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 

6 times you just laid there 
8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 




To My Dear Husband: 
I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
36 times you did not come home at all 
21 times you didn't cum 
33 times you came too soon 
19 times you went soft before you got in 
38 times you worked too late 
10 times you got cramps in your toes 
29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you 
    in the balls 
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
2 times you had ! ! a splinter in your finger 
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV 

Of the times we did get together: 
The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. 
I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, ""Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?"" 
The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. 

Once you read this letter you have to keep it going. 
This game has been played since 1996. 
You must send this letter to 7 people. 
On the 5th day someone will ask you out or say ""I love you."" 
This is not a joke.  It has worked for many years. 
If you break the chain, you will have bad luck with guys/girls 
forever. 
This is just for future readers. 
This began in 1996, not much of a past, but it works. 
So here are the rules: 
*If you read this on a Sunday, wish for a really fun week 
*If you read this on a Monday, wish for money 
*If you read this on a Tuesday, wish for love 
*If you read this on a Wednesday, wish for success 
*If you read this on a Thursday, wish for anything you want 
*If you read this on a Friday, wish for a really hot date 
*If you read this on a Saturday, wish for an important phone call 
Send this to seven people (after you make a wish). 
Make sure it is sent as soon as you read it or your wish won't come true.

"Mist Storage","Dave,
 
I mentioned this project to Barry and he suggested that I forward the e-mail to you.
 
AJ is somewhat cagey but here is what I have gathered.

He has rights to several leases within the Mist field
He acquired these thru his association with Enerfin Energy which is actively producing leases adjacent to NW Natural's Mist Field
NW Natural has an agreement with Enerfin that gives them the right to convert all producing properties to storage when they reach their economic limit.
AJ's leases are not subject to this agreement but he expects that NW Natural would take a piece of the field
He has had some conversations with NW Natural but no specifics have been worked out.

He is in desperate need of equity and so came called, hat in hand, so to speak.
 
Just wanted to see if you had any thought son the project or what you interest might be, if any.

Mark,
I found a good looking job at Anadarko.  (attached).  I believe the hiring supervisor is Bruce Stover who is the chairman of the University of Oklahoma Board of Visitors-College of Engineering where I went to school.  I think I should be able to match up with him but, I don't know him and need some help in getting into his office.  Do you know him and ( here is the big favor) know him well enough to get me into his office???
At any rate let me know what is going on with you in Denver.  This job hunting is like no fun at all.. . . .

"Colorado PUC  NOv 1","
Mark--one of my colleagues, Bob Frank, is going to be attending the hearing on Thursday morning at the Colorado PUC on my behalf.  Bob has as strong background in regulatory proceedings and will be able to expand on our comments before the Commission if given the ability to present.  (As we had talked about previously, it is very possible the the Commissioners will ask interested parties if they would like to speak---this is a tad less formal than evidentiary proceedings).  

I suggested to Bob that you might want to go to the hearing with him since you are officed in Denver and have an interest in the issue.  I'll give you a call on Monday and we'll see what's up in terms of coordinating.  In the meantime, Bob's phone number is  713-853-3180. 


Bob--there is a Westin at Tabor Center that is just across the street from Mark's office.  The Commission is about 10-12 blocks away, but I don't think there are any hotels that are effectively any more convenient than this one.

"NOAA Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI)","NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW ""ENVIRONOMICS"" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.
NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources.

"Re: MLS Properties from RANDY A LASATER","Mark,
 
According to the listing agent, the annual gross income for this unit is $22,800.  This is actual income from the past year. Expect this year to be somewhat less.  Also, a contract has been offered on this property, but not yet accepted.  I'm going over there to take a look today.

"CIG's Raton Basin 2002 Expansion Project","Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

Subject:	RE: Sumas cash trade

Chris,

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Subject: Clatskanie PUD RFP for Gas Supply - Wauna


It was a pleasure to see you and Mark Whitt at the Ziff conference.  As I
mentioned, Clatskanie has elected to proceed with negotiations with another
supplier based upon a proposal providing multi-year primary firm Williams
transportation to Deer Island.

And, as we discussed, sometime during November, as plant operations
approach, it would be appropriate for you and Jeff Shields to get together
with the EWEB and Clatskanie folks to present your ideas (suggested in your
proposal) for mutual business opportunities among Enron, Clatskanie, and
EWEB.  Give me a call at that time and we will coordinate a phone call or
meeting.

Thank you for your participation in our RFP.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?  

Hey Mark--have you talked with your buddies over at Xcel?

Subject:	Colorado GCA Rules

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

Subject:	Heidi Dubose Performance Issues


As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of ""buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

        > costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

        > in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

        > the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599

"Kennedy Oil","Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal.

are only open on weekends in the fall and then do a Christmas special thing
before Christmas and I really don't know if they are open weekends after
Christmas or not.  I will try to find out.

I just talked to Dorcille...Debbie and Jo Beth are coming to their house
Friday...Jo Beth will leave late on Christmas Eve and Debbie will leave
Christmas Day...I would really love to see them...I have not seen Jo Beth's
kids in ages.  Dee asked us for Sun. when she will have all her side of the
family or Mon.  I think Mon. would be better because it would give you guys
a chance to rest up and also the crowd would not be overwhelming.  Dee has
two brothers who have five grown kids between them with spouses and kids so
that is a lot!!!

Lauren could see the beach, too...we'll hope for good weather...so far we've
had a great fall...lots of rain so hopefully that is over and ya'll leave
the cold in CO.

I was going to check on the portacrib to see if you thought Brock would
still fit but if you're bringing one, great.  The woman I borrow it from has
a new baby but she probably isn't using it.

let me know what else I need to get or do...has Kim had Daisy yet???  MJ

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"Plane ride","
A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
""Business trip or vacation?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago.""

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your
business 
role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded.  ""I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really, what myths are those?"" he asked.

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck.""

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  ""I'm
sorry,"" 
she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name.""

""Tonto,"" the man said.  ""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.""

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Subject: fire truck
Date: Mon, 17 Dec 2001 09:46:04 EST


A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
""That sure is a nice fire truck,"" the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

""Thanks,"" the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

""Little partner"" the fire fighter says, ""I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster.""

The little girl says, ""You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

"Action Alert on Energy Legislation","Energy legislation that is helpful to our industry still has a chance of becoming law in this session of congress.  IPAMS needs your participation in contacting members of congress to voice your support for H.R. 4.  Read Below for further details.
Although energy legislation appeared dead in this session of congress, Congressman Nethercutt (R-WA) is seeking support for passing H.R. 4 as a Department of Defense appropriations measure.  According to the Congressman, by placing H.R. 4 in an appropriations measure, it will force bicameral conference on the issue.   However, the Congressman needs our support in order to succeed.
I am trying to get an electronic version of the communication which was faxed to IPAMS, in order to post it on our website.  Regardless we need fast action by email to support this measure.  In response I have drafted a simple letter for IPAMS members to email to all congressman on the appropriations committee.  The text of that letter and the email addresses of the House Appropriations Committee members  Send one on behalf of your company, all employees who are willing to participate, your parents, children, grandparents, etc.  But let?s get the word out.  And please pass this along to anyone who may be interested in supporting energy legislation.  Read below for instructions on getting the word out 
For those of you who are not familiar with H.R. 4 I have attached a copy.  Please read.  It is not 100% perfect but it addresses many issues facing IPAMS members.  
If you have any questions or want further information, please call me at (303) 623-0987.  
Simple Two Step Process to Get the Word Out
Step #1: Cut or Copy and Paste the text below into the body of the email. Then put your name under the signature line.
 
Dear House Appropriations Committee Member:
As a member of the Independent Petroleum Association of Mountain States (IPAMS), the purpose of this letter is to express support for Congressman Nethercutt?s efforts to pass H.R. 4 through the house appropriations committee.  H.R. 4 garnered bipartisan support in the House and provides long overdue legislation implementing a national energy strategy.  National energy legislation is a vital component to national security.   
IPAMS represents independent oil and gas producers in a thirteen state region in the western United States.  IPAMS is committed to assisting its members to continue producing America?s natural resources in an environmentally conscious manner.  For more information please review our website at www.ipams.org or contact IPAMS at (303) 623-0987.
Very Truly Yours

Step #2:       Cut (or Copy) and Paste the below email addresses for the members of the House Appropriations Committee into the Blind Carbon Copy (bcc) line of your email program (this makes the email seem like it goes just to that Congressman).  Also, please put my email address (abremner@ipams.org) in the Carbon Copy (cc) line so I can monitor the response.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

What's up with the IEEE 1451 standard? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some years ago we saw the introduction of the IEEE 1451 architecture for smart transducers, which was supposed to make it possible to connect any kind of sensor or actuator to any kind of bus. While the first part of the standard was completed in 1997, the remainder is still under development and getting a lot of attention.

"FW: Western Frontier","Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

"JM Huber Transaction- Confidential","Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

"FW: ENA Cash Approval Process Meeting","Mark,
I don't think you have any capital expenditures but you're welcome to join in on the call.  I sent the invoices over to Susan Helton (3-1503) in accounting.  She is going to help get the requests done.  Things are still quite fluid and the i-payit system is up (so I hear).

Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.
 
Doug

"Colorado GCA Rules","I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

(the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run.

Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

"Aspen Clean Energy Roundtable to be held MARCH 21-23, 2002","Dear Mr. Whitt,

It is a pleasure to announce our ninth annual Aspen Clean Energy Roundtable.  In keeping with our continual renewal of spirit and enthusiasm, we are holding this event in spring 2002.  This will be our first ski-season Roundtable!

ASPEN CLEAN ENERGY ROUNDTABLE IX
The Aspen Meadows Resort, March 21-23, 2002

- THURS, March 21:  Travel to Aspen; evening registration & reception
- FRI, March 22:  Roundtable sessions & discussions, gala dinner
- SAT, March 23:  Morning Roundtable sessions; optional afternoon discussion
- SUN, March 24:  Departures

We are excited to meet in early spring in Colorado, and hope these dates work for you.  A preliminary program will be posted on our website next week.

The Aspen Clean Energy Roundtable was created in 1994 to discuss investment in clean and sustaining energy and transportation technology solutions.  These include hybrid & electric automobiles, microturbines, fuel cells, hydrogen production & storage, batteries, and distributed energy systems.

Energy security will again be a key component of this year?s discussion, which will include policy and investment implications for oil, gas, coal, nuclear, and renewable energy.  Innovative technologies will again be highlighted.

The Aspen Meadows will be an ideal venue for this year?s Roundtable (please note this event is not connected with the Aspen Institute). Participation is strictly limited to 100 senior executives.  All sessions are ""off the record"" in order to facilitate an open dialogue.

Spouses are welcome!  There will be ample skiing opportunities before and after the Roundtable.

I am also pleased to share that we will soon open our new office in Denver, Colorado.  Our new phone and fax details will be provided shortly; in the meantime, please contact me via my email address.

We hope you can join us in Aspen in March!

Yours truly,

Andrew

Subject:	RE: Huber Docs

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court appeal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requirements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocations exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 336.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges that EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I think this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I would not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since you want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be themselves changed by a later order.  

Hope this makes sense.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Subject:	Mr. Abby  **sensitive













Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

"Bummer...","sometimes things really suck out loud, don't they?  I still plan on coming 
into the office tomorrow.  Like I said, maybe we just need to ride it out 
and things will be fine...and we'll all live happily ever after!  (keeping 
my finger and legs crossed)  Still feel like going out on Friday?  Maybe we 
should do it downtown somewhere.  Comedy works first then dancing?  Keep 
your chin up you handsome devil!

"1967119/Shipping/Change of Method","Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low ""bulk"" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the ""Shipping"" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the ""Comments"" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

Vici

"FW: Natural Gas Origination","Fred, Mark and Brian,

First of all, congratualations to Fred.

Second, I wonder if each of you could give ETS a litttle help.
We monitor all Enron companies to determine which companies sell gas.
We have to do this to comply with the ""Marketing Affiliate Rule.""
We think we have most of the producers, gathers and processers identified.
But, just to make sure could each of you send me a list of each of the companies you handle.
Specifically, we need the name of any of these companies in which Enron has a 10% or greater interest.
If you could identify each as a producer, gatherer or processer, it would help.
Also, we need to know whether the company sells gas at any point other than its own facilities.
Please call if your have any questions.
Thanks for your help.

To:	All Enron Employees North America@ENRON
Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.

We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Subject: RE: Stock Options after merger


Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new."" 


Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

Subject:	Colorado GCA Rules

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

to get this off of your machine.

Dear Friends and e-mail correspondents,

This is a serious e-mail. I anti-virus an e-mail from a work associated
warning of a virus that was passed on to him. His PC was infected and
since I was in his address book it had probably spread to my computer. I
followed the instructions and located the virus. By following the
instructions, I was able to delete the virus. The bad news is that you
probably have it, as you are in my address book. More bad news is that
my anti-virus program did not detect this virus.
This virus lies dormant for 14 days and then kills your hard drive. Here
is what to do. If you follow the instructions and then see that you have
the virus, you will need to send a similar e-mail to everyone in your
address book.

TO CHECK AND REMOVE VIRUS
Click on START pull up to FIND or SEARCH (depending on your computer)
and click on FOLDERS OR FILES
*Type in sulfnbk.exe this is the name of the virus.
*Make sure you are searching on the C DRIVE.
*Click on FIND NOW
*If the search finds the virus it will be listed in the box below the
search. It will have a black icon that will have the name sulfnbk.exe.
DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE!
*RIGHT CLICK on the file and pull down to DELETE.
*It will ask you if you want to delete this file LEFT CLICK YES
*Go to your desktop (where all of your icons are) and RIGHT CLICK on the
RECYCLE BIN (TRASH CAN) click on EMPTY THE ENTIRE BIN
*If you found the virus on your computer you will need to send this

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Subject:FW: It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown!

Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. ""You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't,"" he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged ""need"". ""I guess I was
just really into it, you know?"" he commented with evident embarrassment.


In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. ""It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure,"" said officer Taylor. ""I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin."" Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

""I just went up and said, ""Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?"" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?""

FYI.  Appears that the two sides may be crawling toward renegotiation.

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

My sincerest apologies, please keep me posted on what happens.  I'd like to buy you lunch sometime soon and talk about how we can avoid these situations in the future.  I think if we get master documents in place and convey to you a better understanding of our corporate structure, you'll find Enron easy to deal with, flexible, responsive, and competitive.

As could be expected PSCO has finally implemented PRM this year and did a great job of ""buying the high'.  Now the rate payers will have lower prices than last year but probably twice as high as they should be.  I would definitely like to discuss it with you.  How about 1:30 central on the 8th?

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

        > costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

        > in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

        > the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

"FW:  The Difference between Potentially & Realistically.","


















Little Johnny went up to his father and asked him, ""Dad, what is the
difference between potentially and realistically?""

The father thought for a moment, then answered, ""Go ask your mother if
she would sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars. Then ask
your sister if she would sleep with Brad Pitt for a million dollars,
and ask your brother if he'd sleep with Tom Cruise for a million
dollars. Come back and tell me what you learn from that.""

So little Johnny went to his mother and asked, ""Would you sleep with
Robert Redford for a million dollars?"" The mother replied, ""Of course
I would! I wouldn't pass up an opportunity like that."" Johnny then
went to his sister and asked, ""Would  you sleep with Brad Pitt for a
million dollars?"" The girl replied, ""Oh absolutely, I'd just love to
do that! I'd do it for free!"" Then he went to his brother and asked,
""Would you sleep with Tom Cruise for a million dollars?"" ""Of course,""
the brother replied. ""Do you know how much a million could buy?""

Johnny pondered that for a few days, then went back to his dad. His
father asked him, ""Did you find out the difference between potentially
and realistically? Little Johnny replied, ""Yes, sir. Potentially, 
we're sitting on three million dollars, but realistically, we're
living with two sluts and a fag

Roger,

I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to you by phone.

Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed that none of the
corrected company information I provided the last time around is included.
The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's name with my
address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The facility name is
incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this was correct on the
last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact information on the
second page.

Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?  

Hey Mark--have you talked with your buddies over at Xcel?

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

"RE: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project","Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

"TAGE Newsletter","
The Austin Group Energy, L.P.
Monthly Newsletter

Let's describe a typical and recurring nightmare for generating unit
operators. It's noon on August 15, temperatures have reached the upper 90s
all week; you're well into your reserve margin to serve native load, when a
unit trips off line. Do you scramble to find replacement power at record
high prices and worry about the consequences later? Or, have you prepared
for this event?

When the degree of risk has not been quantified, fear of the unknown can
lead to restless nights, and understandably so. The financial implications
can be astounding when a unit outage occurs during a period of high spikes
in market prices.

How does this relate to the recruitment and hiring of talent within your
shop? Allow me to bring the story together. What would you do if your top
employee came to you and said, ""You've been great to me and I've learned
alot, but I just accepted a job at your level right down the road and they
like me so much they want me to start tomorrow."" Do you spring into 911 mode
or are you ready for this day.

Start a relationship today with The Austin Group Energy. We will keep you
aware of all available talent in your market area. These candidates are
currently employed and do not answer ads. They stay in touch with
opportunities through us to ensure confidentiality. Why would Top 5

successful hires when they could hire them on their own. The smart and

hiring talent, they call The Austin Group Energy.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"Pioneer Oil","Hi Mark:

I've been talking to the folks at Pioneer Oil Company regarding their coalbed methane project in Sheridan County, WY and have quoted them a gathering rate for redelivery into Big Horn.  They currently have only 5 wells drilled, with plans to drill a total of 13 sites, 3 coals each by years end.  Based on the results of this pilot project, an additional 100 wells will be drilled in the first quarter of 2002.  This pilot project is located in T55N, R79W and is a ""stones throw"" from BHGG.

They are interested in discussing transportation and marketing options.  Wayne Fisher has been my primary contact to date and is a consultant working with Pioneer in Sheridan.   Tad Butt is President of Pioneer and is located in Billings, MT.  (This is their first coalbed methane play; Pioneer Oil Company is a supplier of equipment and services to the asphalt paving industry.)

"Re: concerns and suggestions","That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 

I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it! 

Love and Kisses

"Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity","Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.

"Income Tax Issue","Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment ""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some ""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

"2001 Management Conference","
During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

"RE: Colorado GCA Rules","Sue,

Well you would sure think they would file something, and I'm assuming they did, but the filings are probably sitting on somebody's desk.  I am going to be calling one of the information resource people this morning to follow-up.  I'll let you know.

Robert--isn't it kind of odd that the parties who had commented before would not at least file comments in support of the rules?

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

We should know something about the well we are currently reentering next week.  Timing on the gathering line is still uncertain.

These are draft versions of the interruptible purchase agreement and
confirm for your gas into Fort Union.  Think about what you what to do
for term, volume etc.  We will then add in the gathering charges.  We
are pretty flexible, so let me know what works for Patina.

Subject: Hi


Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say ""Superior? Where's That?"" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone. 
Home # 303-543-1108   Cell# 720-313-4857 
                                                Talk to ya soon 
                                                      Anne.

"RE: Western Frontier update","I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Dear MARK:

On behalf of the WHO'S WHO Historical Society, I am pleased to inform
you that you have been selected as a possible candidate for
the 2001/2002 edition of International WHO'S WHO of Professionals.
This is the definitive work on the world's leaders in commerce, economics,
policy, and trade.  In today's difficult economy admission to a powerful
network of professionals can be a career lifeline.
We do require additional information and ask that you complete the data
form via the Internet at http://www.internationalwhoswho.com/fax/5166.htm


There is no fee associated with your listing in WHO'S WHO, and we do not
distribute member information for resale.   Our goal is to provide
reference information and a networking forum for world leaders.

Nomination to WHO'S WHO is an honor in itself.  The Society was founded
in 1928 and provides the most comprehensive listing of professionals whose
contributions shape and direct the destiny of nations.  Our
unabbreviated biographies, of the most successful professionals from 150
countries, are housed in private libraries and collections around the
world.

Current members who grace our pages include leading business executives,
heads of state, noted academics and other professionals.

Our editorial deadline is quickly approaching.  I urge you to act today.
If you delay, I cannot guarantee the committee will have ample time to
review your submission.

Sincerely,

Terrence J. Leifheit
Executive Director

PS:  Please be sure to fill in the fax and e-mail sections so we can get
proofs of your biographical write-up to you quickly if you are selected
for inclusion.

"FW:   Mr. Abby  **sensitive","


                                                                     
 








Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"NADA","The convention dates are now January 26-29, 2002.
 
I'm sending you a new confirmation from the NADA for these dates.  They are using some of the NFL money to refund 100% of the registration fees for the dealers and managers and 50% of the fees for the guests.  Of course I registered everyone before September 11; otherwise I would have registered everyone as managers!  I' m sure that's what everyone will do that registers now.  Who said ""the early bird gets the worm?""

"FW: Four Good Management Lessons!!"," 
What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the
tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the
tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.


Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out
the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,

and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

that's what everyone expects anyway.  Again, good luck, tell Lucci hey and

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 


Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.

"Security Survey","Mark,
	Business Controls, which includes Corporate Security at Enron Corp, would like to conduct a security survey of Enron's offices in Denver.  I am tentatively planning on travel to Denver 10/18-10/19.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office it would help greatly in my planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be my point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Lastly, if the above dates do not work for you, please feel free to suggest alternates.  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

"RE: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project","I understand that Steve Walton is going to join you.  Steve is great and will be superbly helpful on transmission issues.  

I will likely see the current Gov. in Salt Lake City on November 2.  Let me know if I can help.

Would Nov. 1 or 2 work for either of you?

Email me your fax number and I will fax you a copy of what the developers have given me.

Calger asked my to be your Sr. Commercial guy on this potential tranaction....It would be helpful if you would spend a little time with me to better explain the business proposition that you see we would promote.  I will be available for a meeting in Denver.  In fact, I am planning on being their the weekend of Nov. 3.  Maybe we can schedule something around that date.

Give me a call

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

                                       Do you own an C4 Corvette with a winking problem? 
<br>

<br>
Zip Products has teamed up with CorvetteMagazine.com for an in-depth article on how to rebuild your 84-87 Corvette headlight motors.  Tech writer Justin Abbott has completely disassembled his 1986 Corvette headlight motor and replaced the original stripped gears with a new set of bronze headlight gears.  Follow along, getting rid of that wink is not that hard.

In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further.

The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.  In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

"RE: Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project","please keep me posted on progress.... and if there is any way that I can help... photo sessions and baby kissing are my Forte !!!! 

 -----Original Message-----

Cc:	Tycholiz, Barry; Bump, Dan J.
Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

"The Stimulus Package: Too High A Price","
 From the 12/11/01 New Dem Daily.  Please let the Colorado DLC know what 
you think.

This week the long, windy debate in Washington over a so-called economic 
stimulus package will likely be resolved one way or another.  Putting aside 
all the partisan finger-pointing as to who is responsible for this or that 
twist or turn in the process, the bottom line is very clear: Republicans 
are unwilling to support any stimulus package that does not include 
significant new cuts in tax rates for wealthy individuals and 
corporations.  We think that's too high a price to pay for the modest 
relief efforts for the unemployed that should be the focus of this legislation.

The overall economy is not in as bad a shape as many feared at the 
beginning of this debate.  Fiscal stimulus is already being supplied by new 
federal spending related to the war on terrorism and homeland defense.  The 
tax rate cuts Republicans demand will in any event have no positive 
short-term impact on the economy, and could damage its long-range prospects 
by boosting future federal budget deficits.  In effect, the GOP is holding 
unemployment relief hostage to yet another installment in its relentless 
drive for tax cuts targeted to high earners.

It's time for Democrats to call the whole thing off, and call the 
Republicans' bluff on unemployment relief by decoupling it from tax rate 
cuts.  Congress should be debating whether to cancel some of the high-end 
tax cuts enacted earlier this year, in order to pay for the war on 
terrorism.  Instead, Congressional Republicans have spent months talking 
about new demands on public funds for the Americans who are least 
vulnerable in the economic slowdown, and least likely to make personal 
sacrifices in the war effort at home or abroad.

If fiscal discipline means anything at all, it means a willingness to 
resist these sorts of demands.  New Democrats favor bipartisan compromises 
in the pursuit of the national interest, but not in the pursuit of special 
interests.  A deal with Republicans to secure new tax rate cuts would not 
be a compromise between ""Left"" and ""Right,"" but between right and wrong.

"Denver Visit","Mark, Brian, and Steve,
	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

"virus alert!","Sorry everyone! 
I've received a virus from someone else and now  your computer may be affected since you're in my address book. I'm told it  lies dormant for 14 days, 
THEN IT KILLS YOUR HARD DRIVE! 

NOTE: When I receive this notice, I updated my McAfee and ran a full scan, and it did not catch it. 

Here's how to stop it, if you've got it.  Also, send this message to everyone in your 
address book. I received this message, followed the instructions and got rid of it, so please do the same. 

The directions for removing it are easy: 

1. Go to 'Start' - then to 'find or search' (depending on your computer). 

2. In the 'search for files or folders' type in sulfnbk.exe - this is the virus. 

3. In the 'look in' make sure you're searching Drive C. 

4. Hit 'search' button (or 'find') 

5. If this file shows up (it's an ugly blackish icon that will have  the  name  'sulfnbk.exe' -     DO NOT OPEN IT. 

6. Right click on the file - go down to delete and left click. 

7. It will ask you if you want to send it to the recycle bin, say yes. 

8. Go to your desktop (where all your icons are) and double click on the recycle bin. 

9. Right click on sulfnbk.exe and delete again - or empty the bin. 

If you find it send this e-mail to all in your address book, because that's how it is transferred. 

I Apologize!

Do you have a motor management plan in place?

Cutting costs in manufacturing companies is critically important these days-often a matter of survival. It's even better if it can be done while causing little or no pain to the organization. One excellent way to accomplish this is to cut energy costs by installing high-efficiency motors.

"New Democrat Update - December 2001","
This email is the monthly update for December on the progress of the 
Colorado Democratic Leadership Council and New Democrat Movement in our 
state.  The Colorado DLC is a think tank focused on local, state and 
federal issues of interest to this region.  The New Democrat Update is 
distributed to more than 3,600 elected officials and private citizens the 
first week of each month.

**REJUVENATING RURAL COLORADO**

In the old economy, most rural areas had reasonably strong and stable 
economic bases to support growth and jobs.  In addition to low costs, 
plentiful labor and adequate physical infrastructure, rural regions 
depended on innovative economic activities ""filtering down"" from urban areas.

Clearly, those days are over.  The innovative, well-paying industries 
increasingly cluster in the metropolitan suburbs, providing minimal 
economic benefits to rural Colorado.  To date, most rural economies have 
been largely left out and are having significant difficulty competing and 
prospering in the New Economy.

Rural communities face a new opportunity and challenge to prosper in this 
new world. The opportunity -  unlike the old economy, new technologies 
allow economic activity to be geographically farther apart while still 
functionally tight.  The challenge - much of rural Colorado has limited 
access to high-speed telecommunications technologies, a critical factor in 
determining business location and expansion decisions.

Federal, state and local governments, in partnership with the private 
sector, must help rural communities adapt and develop innovative, 
technology-based economies through seed venture programs, 
technology-incubators, industry-university research partnerships and 
collaborative technology modernization projects.  Ideally, nonprofit 
entrepreneurial organizations, linked to the private sector, should run 
these initiatives.

Much like the digital economy, today's economic strategies take a strong 
combination of good hardware and software.  The Colorado congressional 
delegation can help with the ""hardware"" by pushing for federal funding to 
co-invest in business applications with rural broadband telecommunications 
providers.  In addition, they should support Senator Tom Daschle's proposal 
to provide federal loans to rural utility providers for deployment of 
broadband telecommunication connections.

Growing and prospering in the New Economy also requires the right 
""software"" - in this case, the skills and knowledge of young people.  As a 
result of an undue reliance on property taxes, many rural school districts 
experience gross inequities.  The state can become a much better partner by 
overhauling its antiquated K-12 public school funding system.  While money 
alone will not solve educational problems, neither will a lack of resources.

Innovative private-public partnerships like PowerUP can also help.  With 
centers that have between 10 and 20 Internet-connected computers, PowerUP 
provides practical training to young people by getting technology into 
schools, community centers and other organizations.  The sites are open and 
welcoming, as well as safe places for young people to spend time.  Staff 
encourage students to work together, and computers are placed so that 
supervisors can see what is on each person's monitor at all times.

Among PowerUP's notable partners is the Corporation for National Service's 
AmeriCorps program, which provides young volunteers who, in exchange for 
help with college tuition, go into communities to set up and help manage 
the computer centers.  As non-technical users and innovators, these 
""Digital Brigades"" help train local students while implementing 
technology-based projects that improve and help the community.

Colorado state and local governments should partner with the private sector 
and provide matching funds to spur development of rural technology 
centers.  The State of Florida has taken that approach, leveraging a 
relatively modest $500,000 investment and creating 25 computer lab sites 
across the state.

Universities and community colleges can strengthen the competitiveness of 
rural firms by analyzing the specific needs of local economies and offering 
consulting services on technology and processes.  Public matching funds for 
joint university-private sector research can be tied to new product 
development.

Nonprofit corporations, which share technological innovations and identify 
new product and process opportunities, should be organized.  New technology 
clearinghouses can provide data on new patents and ideas relevant to local 
industries.

Forming innovative alliances  - as well as leveraging private/public sector 
funding, leadership, and volunteers - can effectively meet rural Colorado's 
economic challenges.  We have no time to waste.

**CONNECTING TO RURAL COLORADO**

To develop a progressive majority coalition, Colorado Democrats must do 
much in better in rural regions of the state.  Republicans control almost 
75 percent of county commissions and Democrats send a very small handful of 
rural legislators to the State House.  In the last presidential election, 
Vice President Al Gore lost the rural vote by 20 points.

State Democrats at all levels of government can close this gap by closely 
examining Mark Warner's gubernatorial victory last month in Virginia.  His 
statewide message - improvements in education and the quality of life would 
bring ""knowledge jobs"" to all parts of the state - proved decisive.

Just as important, Warner embraced mainstream, values-based positions on 
cultural issues, realizing that tone matters as well as substance.  Our 
party can speak about tough issues like gun control and gay rights without 
implying that no decent and reasonable person can have a different 
view.  Voters who feel marginalized, even demonized, by hard-left rhetoric 
will almost certainly retaliate.

For many rural voters, the role of government is in part an issue of 
values. The New Democratic stance on this issue - that government should 
equip people to solve their own problems - is sure to make significant 
inroads into the rural electorate.

**NEW WORLD, NEW WAR**

The November/December issue of Blueprint provides a roadmap on how America 
can defeat terrorism, grow the economy and ask all Americans to give 
something back.  This edition includes provocative articles by DLC national 
Chair Evan Bayh, former President Bill Clinton, Senator Joe Lieberman, and 
Senator John Kerry.  Other pieces provide insight on modernizing our 
intelligence services, strategies to defend the country from weapons of 
mass destruction, beefing up homeland defense, the crisis in the Mideast, 
reinventing NATO, why Saddam Hussein's Iraq must be the next target and more.

You can read Blueprint online by visiting www.coloradodlc.org and clicking 
on ""New World, New War.""  It is the first item under What's Up 
Nationally.  If you would like a hard copy, contact Jim Gibson at
