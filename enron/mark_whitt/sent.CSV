Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project","ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Subject:	CIG's Raton Basin 2002 Expansion Project

Hello Paul and Mark.  FYI:  CIG proposes to construct and operate facilities necessary to transport additional volumes of approximately 55 MDth per day of natural gas out of the Raton Basin Area in Colorado and New Mexico.  

The total cost of the project is $26,896,800  with a proposed rolled-in treatment for the expansion out of the Raton Basin Area.

Question - Do you all have any issues that you want us to address in regards to the expansion or will a plain vanilla intervention be fine?  The intervention is due Nov. 5th.

If you could get to me between now and the early part of next week, that would be great.

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well.

Subject:	Income Tax Issue

Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment ""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some ""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a phone call today.

Subject:	RE: Western Frontier update

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Subject:	JM Huber Transaction- Confidential

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
""That sure is a nice fire truck,"" the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

""Thanks,"" the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

""Little partner"" the fire fighter says, ""I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster.""

The little girl says, ""You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"RE: Western Frontier update","I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

I've been giving this some thought for the past few weeks actually, trying 
to figure out how I'd manage as a working mom.  Been there, done that, 
although not with 3 kids, but it's definitely manageable.  Fortunately, 
Brigette is old enough to manage for a few hours after school with the kids, 
until I get home.  My issues would be finding something structured for 
Christian and Brianna during the summers and arranging transportation to and 
from school.  Already have some ideas and options.  It's just a matter of 
committing to one plan or another, and finding out how soon this needs to be 
arranged.  How does my resume look?  Do I need to polish it up for the ""big 
wigs"", I know it should look more professional.  Are you still thinking a 
temp. position or sending me to the other office for something more 
permanent? Still think you need me in your office though! - Christina

Tropical storm Allison did us in. 2 feet of water in the casa. Lost everything except some furniture. Nad's can't make up her freaking mind as to what she wants sooooo, we are moving at a ""deliberate"" pace. I've reached my ""let's make a decision"" point a long time ago. We do not like each other anymore, and fight like cats and dogs. I give her until the end of the year before she tells me to hit the road. Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago.

The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.

Tropical storm Allison did us in. 2 feet of water in the casa. Lost everything except some furniture. Nad's can't make up her freaking mind as to what she wants sooooo, we are moving at a ""deliberate"" pace. I've reached my ""let's make a decision"" point a long time ago. We do not like each other anymore, and fight like cats and dogs. I give her until the end of the year before she tells me to hit the road. Without Meaghan I would have been gone long ago.

The kids are great!  Brock is finally becoming alot more fun.  He and Lauren get along really well.

Still living in the apartment, trying to decide what to do with the house (repair or rebuild). Things continue to deteriorate with Nadine. Between you and me I doubt if we'll make it to our 20th anniversary unless it's for Meaghan's sake.

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

The only other thing would be if you wanted to add intrastates systems (like OTTCO) and then the pipes at either end of I-80 like Trailblazer, KM, PSCO, KRGT, NWP, Overthrust, and Questar.

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

it was, you were trying to sell your group and that you didn't seem worried
at all, which is good.  Good Luck with that as I know it will be tough.  On
the bright side, if you sell it, you are a friggin hero for pulling off a

Subject:	Change of Control Provisions


As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say ""Superior? Where's That?"" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone.

This is worth considering. Let's all be careful! 


Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the 
reactionary thing and send out just anything that crosses my path.  This one, 
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my 
mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago. 
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up. She was understandably 
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied. 

On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished 
he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like 
that. The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any 
commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween. As 
soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since 
turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came 
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. 

I may be wrong, and I hope I am. However, with one of his warnings being 
correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second 
and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same information 
that I did.

Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.
 
Doug

Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?

Subject: 



To My Dear Wife: 
During the past year I have tried to make love to you 365 times. I have succeeded 36 times, which is an average of once every ten days. The following is a list of why I did not succeed more often: 

54 times the sheets were clean 
17 times it was too late 
49 times you were too tired 
20 times it was too hot 
15 times you pretended to be asleep 
22 times you had a headache 
17 times you were afraid of waking the baby 
16 times you said you were too sore 
12 times it was the wrong time of the month 
19 times you had to get up early 
9 times you said weren't in the mood 
7 times you were sunburned 
6 times you were watching the late show 
5 times you didn't want to mess up your new hairdo 
3 times you said the neighbors would hear us 
9 times you said your mother would hear us 
Of the 36 times I did succeed, the activity was not satisfactory because: 

6 times you just laid there 
8 times you reminded me there's a crack in the ceiling 
4 times you told me to hurry up and get it over with 
7 times I had to wake you and tell you I finished 
1 time I was afraid I had hurt you because I felt you move 




To My Dear Husband: 
I think you have things a little confused. Here are the reasons you didn't get more than you did: 
5 times you came home drunk and tried to screw the cat 
36 times you did not come home at all 
21 times you didn't cum 
33 times you came too soon 
19 times you went soft before you got in 
38 times you worked too late 
10 times you got cramps in your toes 
29 times you had to get up early to play golf 
2 times you were in a fight and someone kicked you 
    in the balls 
4 times you got it stuck in your zipper 
3 times you had a cold and your nose was running 
2 times you had ! ! a splinter in your finger 
20 times you lost the notion after thinking about it all day 
6 times you came in your pajamas while reading a dirty book 
98 times you were too busy watching football, baseball, etc. on TV 

Of the times we did get together: 
The reason I laid still was because you missed and were screwing the sheets. 
I wasn't talking about the crack in the ceiling, what I said was, ""Would you prefer me on my back or kneeling?"" 
The time you felt me move was because you farted and I was trying to breathe. 

Once you read this letter you have to keep it going. 
This game has been played since 1996. 
You must send this letter to 7 people. 
On the 5th day someone will ask you out or say ""I love you."" 
This is not a joke.  It has worked for many years. 
If you break the chain, you will have bad luck with guys/girls 
forever. 
This is just for future readers. 
This began in 1996, not much of a past, but it works. 
So here are the rules: 
*If you read this on a Sunday, wish for a really fun week 
*If you read this on a Monday, wish for money 
*If you read this on a Tuesday, wish for love 
*If you read this on a Wednesday, wish for success 
*If you read this on a Thursday, wish for anything you want 
*If you read this on a Friday, wish for a really hot date 
*If you read this on a Saturday, wish for an important phone call 
Send this to seven people (after you make a wish). 
Make sure it is sent as soon as you read it or your wish won't come true.

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Subject: ENA Cash Approval Process Meeting


Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.
 
Doug

Mark,

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
you soon.

Kind regards,

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided
I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional.
Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided
that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous
things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Subject: Medicine Bow Tie-In Capacity


Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 6th segment to gate valve 5 providing a
total firm capacity of 519 Mdth/day was approved by FERC yesterday and is
available for transport.  The contract effective date for this additional
capacity will be on Monday, November 5.  We plan on filing the request for
the final segment of additional contacted capacity to gate valve 4 today or
Monday.

Based on conversations with many of you, it appears the 192 Mdth/day of
additional (572 Mdth/day total) capacity on Medicine Bow provided by this
last segment commissioning will be sufficient to accomodate your
transportation requirements until the entire project goes into service
(anticipated late this month).  For the month of October, the capacity
contracted was approximatly 90% utilized, and we anticipate even greater
utilization for November.  While a few of you have mentioned possibly having
production in excess of your contract, it appears that the remaining
shippers will have underutilized capacity and no additional capacity will be
necessary until the Loop goes in service.    

Following the last segment approval notice, I will continue to update you on
the progress and timing for the entire Loop in-service for your information
and planning. 

Please call me if you have any questions.     

Laine Lobban

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

"Mourning the Loss of a special man","I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

Love

Mark Whitt

Mark,
I don't think you have any capital expenditures but you're welcome to join in on the call.  I sent the invoices over to Susan Helton (3-1503) in accounting.  She is going to help get the requests done.  Things are still quite fluid and the i-payit system is up (so I hear).

Folks,
 
Please plan on attending a conference call Thursday morning (12/13) at 10 am CST to discuss how the cash approval process will be carried out going forward.  Attached is an example of the 5 day rolling forecast that the Cash Management Committee uses as an agenda.  Also attached is the Cash Use Approval Request form that will be used for justifying the payment of expenses.  We will discuss the process and lay out some guidelines for getting things through the Committee and executed as smoothly as possible.  Houston people will meet in ECS 05116 (conference room on the left-hand wall as you come into the room).  I will send out the dial-in number tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your help in this.
 
Doug

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.

Subject:	Western Frontier Project

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

"San Juan Deal - Gathering procedures","Brian, After talking to our legal department it seems that in order to effectuate the wellhead purchase we will need assignment of the Williams contract instead of being agent.  This is important because we will have title to the gas at Durango.  Therefore we need to have the contract assigned to us.  Can you talk to Williams ASAP and see if that is a problem?

Thanks

Subject: Income Tax Issue


Hello Penny,

It was nice meeting you and your associates yesterday.  I presented the
income tax issue that we discussed to some of our accountants and they
see things a little differently.  It is our opinion, that since a cash
payment would be offset by the demand charge obligations associated with
the capacity contract, it is not income per se, but rather funds
dedicated to meeting an out-of-the-money contract obligation.  Depending
on your accounting method, that money would probably be amortized over
the term of the contract.  Let me know what you think, perhaps we should
have our accountants talk.

As for adjusting the cash amount after the San Juan/Permian allocation
issue is settled (I'm not sure you could hear all that at your end of
the table) we are not really interested in any type of post assignment
""true-ups"".   But we are willing to talk about what those allocation
percentages should be.

Regarding next steps, on Monday I will provide you with some
""alternative"" forms of payment and some ways we might spread the
payments out0.  After that we will look to you guys for your preferred
deal structure and payment terms.  I'll follow up this email with a
phone call today.

Subject:	Western Frontier Project

The FERC notice on this project has been issued and comments are due by November 21.  Do we have any interests that would warrant more than a plain intervention?  Let me know if you want a copy of the original filing, with maps, etc.

INSIDE FERC-October 29, 2001
WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""
To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that
Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months.""
With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand
increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter
generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

I am so sorry about Jack.  It is very difficult for me to accept that he is gone.  He was a very special man to me as I was growing up.  Jack was as much like an Uncle to me as any of my blood relatives.  He always represented the pillar of strength while still being able to to be one of the most loving and compassionate people I have ever known.  To me Jack was everything a man was supposed to be.  

It always made me proud to talk to Jack about my football games and later on the oil and gas business.  It was neat that in a way I was following a similiar path in life to the one that Jack had taken.  And when my daughter was born I began to see how he must of felt about his three wonderful daughters, who I still consider to be like sisters to me.  I was so excited when Little Jack was born this year because I knew how proud and excited he must have been to finally have his boy.  I hope someday I have the opportunity to tell him what a special man his Grandpa was. 

The thing I always will remember about Jack was that when he walked into a room, he filled it up, not because of his size, but because of his enormous personality and lust for life.  He could always put a smile on your face. The world has lost a very special man.

I know this is hard for you and the girls.  It is hard for me to write this without breaking up. I Love you guys and wish I was there with you.

Love

Mark Whitt

Subject:	2001 Management Conference


During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

	Further to my conversation two weeks ago with Mark, I would like to schedule a visit to Denver 11/19-20.  As a reminder, Business Controls is looking at the security posture of Enron facilities worldwide.  Currently, we are focusing our resources on domestic sites.  At the moment, I am planning for one of our IT specialists to travel from Portland to assist me with reviewing IT back-up procedures, recovery, and continuity issues.  If I could impose on you to provide some information about the office, it would greatly help in our planning.
	In particular, could you briefly describe the office(s); physical location, which floor, how large, how many employees, and any other Enron subsidiaries or offices in Denver.  Additionally, would you be our point of contact, or can you designate someone?  Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 

I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it! 

Love and Kisses

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Mark,

	I am committed to a meeting in Seattle with the Western Governors and the FERC on November 1 and 2 respectively.  The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.  I know that is beyond your two week window, but it would be the best time for me.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I have to give the Broker a tentative number on the 12th.  I will let you know what kind of count I have at that point.  I've put down $500 as a deposit and the remainder will be put on someone's card.  

As far as the cost, it's approximately $100/person, depending on how much we drink.  I can either figure a total for your group prior to the evening or wait until the final bill is determined and invoice you for the relative cost.

However you want to work it is fine with me.

The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Eric,

This spreadsheet summarizes the pricing terms for the proposed Kennedy Oil transaction that we discussed earlier.

 
Also, attached in the e-mail below, I have included a ""Discussion Document"" that Mark and Pual put together for the purpose of discussions with Kennedy.  It provides more specifics on the pricing and volume allocation, if you desire.

Based on my calculations, the 10,000/d priced at NYMEX minus $0.62 is roughly $300,000 in the money and the 5,000/d priced at NGPL MidCon minus $0.47 is roughly $500,000 in the money.

I will be out next week, but Mark and Paul will keep you posted as to the expected close date and any changes in the deal terms.  Please give me a call today if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tyrell

Subject:	Plane ride


A man boarded an airplane and took his seat.  As he settled in, he
glanced 
up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
she 
was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat

right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
""Business trip or vacation?""

She turned, smiled and said, ""Business.  I'm going to the annual 
Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago.""

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, ""What's your
business 
role at this convention?""

""Lecturer,"" she responded.  ""I use my experience to debunk some of the 
popular myths about sexuality.""

""Really, what myths are those?"" he asked.

""Well,"" she explained, ""one popular myth is that African American men
are 
the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
is 
most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
men 
are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
the 
Southern redneck.""

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  ""I'm
sorry,"" 
she said, ""I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
know 
your name.""

""Tonto,"" the man said.  ""Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba.""

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

"RE: Proposal","I can show you what the difference is between Cheyenne Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.  To clarify, you do not have to buy on Enron Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.  You do not have to decide that now.  My recommendation is the attached:


Major changes are:

Volume - 20,000 mmbtu/d
Price - Gas Daily Cheyenne Midpoint plus $.05
Demand Charge- $6,000 per month

In addition. Enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu

All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and Enron's review of the PSCo transportation contract.

Let me know what you think.

Mark, Brian,
The US based Producers that are taking over Canadian Producers are moving alot of hedging control back to the US.  I want to make sure that we up here are passing on information to you and vice versa about plans to hedge.  In the case of the Devon hedge, it was fairly well publicised that they had to do something to hedge the Anderson purchase, but there are other cases where we might get some news and need to pass it on for coverage down south.
Should it be you two we contact?

We specfically need to think some about coordinating on companies like Apache, Hunt, Devon, Burlington, Murphy.

Did we get any of the Devon volume in Houston?  It was alot of gas.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Have you started thinking about falling back on that pro wrestling career

Have you made Lauren and Brock get jobs to help out a little?
Lauren's probably big enough to push a lawnmower or farm-out to the textile

Also, before the Feds bust down your office door, I would try to delete as
much porn off your hard drive as possible - it just doesn't look right.

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

I spoke with the ""WebMeister"" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

MArk--I put out a couple of calls to find on the 2002 Governors race in Wyoming, and the feedback I got was similiar to what we talked about.....there has not been a clear candidate yet, and Joe Meyers name is one of three possible Republican contestants. (the other two that are being talked about are Eli Bebout and Ray Hupkins--don't know if I got my spelling right on these boys!).  Apparently there was alot of discussion about the current US Senator, Craig Thomas, wanting to run and so everybody was pretty much waiting until he made up his mind before jumping into the race.  My understanding is that Thomas did make up his mind about 2 weeks ago to stay in the Senate, so your Mr. Meyers may very well be strongly considering a run.

"Heidi Dubose Performance Issues","
As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

What is the word dudes?
 
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!


Lesson Number One 
***************** 
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. 
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, 
""Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"" 
The crow answered: ""Sure, why not."" 

So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested. 
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it. 

Management Lesson: 
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two 
***************** 
A turkey was chatting with a bull. 
""I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,""sighed the turkey, 
""but I haven't got the energy. 
""Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?"" replied the bull. 
""They're packed with nutrients."" 

The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him 
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree. 
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. 
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. 
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree. 

Management Lesson: 
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three 
******************** 
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss. 
The brain said, 
""I should be Boss 
    because I control the whole body's responses and functions."" 
 
The feet said, 
""We should be Boss 
    as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
 
"" The hands said, 
""We should be the Boss 
    because we do all the work and earn all the money."" 

And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes.... 
 
until finally the asshole spoke up. 
 
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. 
So the asshole went on strike, 
    blocked itself up and refused to work. 

Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched, 
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered. 

Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss, 
so the motion was passed. 
 
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out the shit! 

Management Lesson: 
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four 
******************* 

A little bird was flying south for the winter. 
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field. 
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. 
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was. 
The dung was actually thawing him out! 
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. 

A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. 
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, 
and promptly dug him out and ate him! 

Management Lessons: 
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy. 
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend. 
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Dear Mark Whitt,

Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.

Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
is a factor), because it's based on the very low ""bulk"" rates Sierra Trading
Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.

If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
do so in the ""Shipping"" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
the ""Comments"" section. 

Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.

Sincerely,

Vici

Subject:	WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT 

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

"RE: EPNG Proposal II","I had not heard that there was a discussion today. However, since we ran the economics for Huber and discovered that Enron's books do not appropriately value the Permian capacity, we have been trying to convince BP that the value of the capacity is greater than the basis spread becase of the optionality associated with the variable costs of fuel and commodity.  We used to have a model that the transport group used to use to value that optionality based upon the volatility of the basis spreads and the variable costs.  Steph and Phil are running numbers to determine Enron's ""extrinsic value"".  We need to discuss how and what information we share with BP in order to convince them that the capacity is worth more than the value than that the  outright basis markets .
