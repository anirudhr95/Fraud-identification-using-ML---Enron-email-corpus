BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Most Americans are enjoying a three day weekend this Saturday, and I hope you are enjoying yours.  I also hope you'll find the time to share in our nation's observance of Memorial Day, when we pause to reflect on the cost of the free lives we live today.   I will be marking the day with military veterans gathering at the White House, who knew and remember the people who never came back from our nation's wars.  I will then go to Arlington National Cemetery, to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns.  It will be a high honor and I will be there on behalf of all the people of the United States.   Later that day, I will join with veterans in Arizona for a commemoration and national moment of remembrance.  Most of us know war veterans; I had the privilege of being raised by one.  Usually, they are reticent about their experiences.  It is often difficult for them to think back on those names and faces, on the ones who never lived to be called veterans.   Read and listen to the complete radio address at http://gopusa.com/bush/radio18.html    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]THE REAL THREAT OF THE FAITH-BASED INITIATIVE  By Star Parker   The faith-based initiative is our latest proof that politicians are great entrepreneurs in finding ways to expand the scope of government, their own power and control over our lives. This particular initiative should be of concern to all because, in the best scenario, it will only waste money. In the worst case, however, it will be destructive to our nation.   Although for President Bush this initiative is a crusade to reach minorities, welfare programs have already done enough damage in black America. Government dependency has created an environment in which black illegitimacy rates have soared seventy percent. This time the victim of government intervention will be the black church.   However, there is an even deeper concern facing us than this.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/starparker    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]JEFFORDS WAS NEVER A REPUBLICAN  By Doug Patton   U.S. Sen. James Jeffords of the Peoples' Republic of Vermont has officially changed his party label and gone home pouting, as the catchy question is thrown around Washington, ""Who lost Jeffords?""   Who cares? Good riddance.    I know. Jeffords' announcement last week that he would switch his party affiliation from Republican to Independent (read ""Socialist""), has sent the Republican leadership into apoplectic fits -- and rightfully so. After all, we're talking about a gigantic shift in control of the United States Senate. The count will now be 50-49-1, thereby putting the Democrats back in the driver's seat for the first time in six years. Control of the Foreign Relations Committee will go from Jesse Helms to Joe Biden. The Judiciary Committee chairmanship will pass from Orrin Hatch to Patrick Leahy (another Vermont lefty). And the thought of Ted Kennedy chairing anything makes my skin crawl as much as the next patriotic American.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dougpatton    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]POLITICAL PROBLEM OR MORAL PROBLEM?  By Dorothy Anne Seese   Let me begin this with a quote that is attributed to John Adams, the second president of the United States: ""Statesmen, my dear Sir, may plan and speculate for liberty, but it is Religion and Morality alone, which can establish the Principles upon which Freedom can securely stand. The only foundation of a free Constitution is pure Virtue, and if this cannot be inspired into our People in a greater Measure, than they have it now, they may change their Rulers and the forms of Government, but they will not obtain a lasting liberty.""Maybe that explains why this nation has more laws and less liberty, more crime than virtue, more government and less respect for the nation.    We the American people are losing our liberties daily.  Our constitutional guarantees are being judicially overruled and legislated out of existence, all for our own good (so they tell us) or in the alternative, it's ""for the children.""    Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dorothyanneseese    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]BRUCKHEIMER'S PEARL HARBOR IS AN EXAMPLE OF FAILED READINESS  By Rick Erickson   On Memorial Day, when Touchstone Pictures introduces Jerry Bruckheimer's Pearl Harbor, viewers who remember the shock of Japan's raid on Hawaii will undoubtedly leave the theater unsatisfied with Hollywood's glamorization of an American catastrophe, and the members of Americans for Military Readiness want to set the record straight as to what was left out of the movie -- the glaring example of our unreadiness for war.   As early as February 15, 1941, Admiral Husband Kimmel, Commander of the Pacific Fleet, scoffed at suggestions that Japan would ever provoke a war with the U.S. by executing a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Such a scenario was to the U.S. Command what Gordon Grange described in his, At Dawn We Slept, as ""a mouse kicking a cat."" According to Grange, U.S. Naval Command at Pearl Harbor focused less on prevention of such an attack and, instead, was blindly steadfast that, should Japan actually carry out such an unlikely invasion, the cat that was the United States would pounce mercilessly upon the mouse regarded as Imperial Japan.

Another favor on EEX - could you please reprice the outstanding positions for BWT assuming an ""unwind"" of July 1, 2001.  I think the last time you priced these you did them at Enron's offer price.  Please let me know if any questions and thanks for all the help.

"Best way to proceed","Hi Paul,

I had an hour-long conversation yesterday with a guy from Tyler named
Jorge Uresti.  He proposed a very interesting idea, and I'd love to get
your feedback on it.

Jorge has worked on in media, advertising, etc. for political campaigns
since 1994.  He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs,
billboards) for various levels of campaigns.  I think he sees the vast
marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and
he wants to be involved.  He threw out the idea of creating a section of
GOPUSA called GOPUSA MediaWorks.  This division would be under the
GOPUSA umbrella and handle all media operations for conservative
business, candidates, and elected officials.  The scope would be web
design, media, advertising, and on and on.

I'm very excited about this because it taps into the whole top-level
vision I have for the company which is to help get the conservative
message out.  Whether we are doing it ourselves (through our news,
information, and commentary) or providing the tools for others to do it,
we can become THE source for conservative activists to get or deliver
their message.

So, assuming this is a good idea (and if it's totally lame, please tell
me), what would be the best way of structuring it?  Simple
sub-contracting?  Creating a separate division?  My instincts tell me
that subcontracting would be easiest right now.  Plus, if the
relationship turned out to be unworkable, then we simply stop doing
business with them.

How would be go about pricing all of this?  What type of percentage
would be fair?  Obviously, we are talking about work that the current
GOPUSA is unable to perform because I don't have the time (for web
design stuff) or the experience (in the media stuff).  On the flip side,
there is no doubt that we could deliver clients these guys that they
would have never landed on their own.  If some folks in their region
might not know them, but they might be familiar with GOPUSA.

Anyway, I'm just passing along some thoughts.  Perhaps Chris might have
some comments as well.

Take care,

Bobby

I definitely want to visit with you about your experiences here at Enron.  Just let me know what works.

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Charlie,

Please find attached two files that contain information for gas swap pricing for the following deals:

1.	NICOR
2.	Anadarko (Carthage)

We have put notes at the bottom of each page to help clarify our request.  A notional price is fine for right now, let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks for your help,

John

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"NEW WEATHER SWAPS ON THE INTERCONTINENTAL EXCHANGE","  
[IMAGE]
IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.
To trade weather swaps you must have our new version 8 release installed on your system. An advisory  with details about this new release is being sent to you by separate email.  
We encourage all or our users to take a serious  look at the new weather products being offered by the IntercontinentalExchange.  Please contact one of our following representatives to find out about the new  weather products, or check back on our website product guide:

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  The events of September the 11th left
America sadder and stronger, and they clarified some important goals for
our country.  We have a war to wage and a recession to fight.  Defending
our country and strengthening our economy are great priorities for 2002.
 We must be determined and we must keep our focus.

This Saturday, I'm traveling in Oregon and California, talking with
people who have been hit hard by the economic downturn.  When I return
to Washington on Monday, I will be meeting with my economic advisors and
other officials to discuss the latest economic data and work for a quick
recovery for our economy.

Choosing the Path Home
By Alan Keyes

The afterglow of the Christmas season is a good occasion to recall that
the American family, like the Holy Family leaving Bethlehem, has a long
journey ahead of it.  And there are other reminders for us in the
Christmas story -- some cheerful, and others less so.  Among these are
the families that remained in Bethlehem, grieving over the sacrifice of
innocent children, killed at Herod's command.

This Christmas has been indelibly marked by the events of Sept. 11, and
the ongoing struggle against terrorism.  Yet it is not these evils which
the slaughter of innocents at the first Christmas should most bring to
mind.  A greater grief than international terror afflicts us, because
our children, who are the future of America, remain under savage assault
both within the womb and during their most vulnerable early years.

The Rumsfeld Mystique: Understanding His Popularity
By Carol Devine-Molin

I noticed that the ground was beginning to shift last summer with the
re-emergence of  machismo males, or truly masculine men if you will,
embracing their testosterone-driven  behaviors, and coming back into
style. In a scene reminiscent of the movie ""Jaws"", eight- year old
Jessie Arbogast lost his arm stemming from an attack by a 7-foot bull
shark on  July 6th of last year in Florida. The young victim's uncle,
Vance Flosenzier, was there to  intervene in a spectacular manner at the
onset. In an amazing accomplishment, Flosenzier  proceeded to drag that
dastardly shark, that carnivorous sea beast, to the shore with only  his
bare hands and brute force, for the purpose of extracting the boy's arm
from the  shark's gut. In our collective memory, none of us had ever
heard of such a thing being  done before. And everyone loved it!

And the ""Day of Infamy"" only generated more respect for the intrepid
""manly men"" of  the working class, the firefighters, policemen and
emergency workers who braved life  and limb to rescue those at the World
Trade Center. As President Bush has indicated, the  tragic circumstances
of 9/11 have caused us to re-evaluate our priorities, and to sort out
that which is truly important in life. And, clearly, a dauntless spirit
and selflessness are  not only salient human attributes, but deeply
attractive ones as well.

The Euro Makes All Things Possible
By SARTRE

Euro, Euro, Euro all around, but not a pence of 'real money', to spend.
With these euro notes of this common currency, the wire services heap
praise on its successful launch. The wheels of business and the
mechanism of finance are all in gear to usher in this brave new world of
commerce. For years we have heard the benefits of the first united
coinage since the Roman Empire and the elimination of the chaos of
individual currencies. So what will this conversion mean for Europe and
the rest of the world?

The conclusion largely depends on what you consume from the political
plate and whether you wish to place your thumb on the scale that weighs
the beef. The traditions of Europe are quite different from those of the
original colonies when it comes to a monetary perspective. With the
founding of our Nation, constitutional powers were enumerated regarding
the nature and coinage of money. Individual States were restricted from
their own coinage, while punishment for counterfeiting was established.
Standard weights and measures of gold and silver were defined as legal
tender. So what does this have to do with the modern world and the
financial developments on the continent?

A Good Villain is Hard to Find
By Dorothy Anne Seese

It's just not easy to find a good sustainable villain in our modern
times.

Hitler and Stalin enjoyed a fairly long run on the world's Bijou stage,
but after their days came to an end, Hitler in 1945 and Stalin in 1953,
we really haven't had anyone of their evil ilk in the real world.  To be
sure, Mao Tse Tung got his share of publicity and may have done in more
folks than either Hitler or Stalin, but he had no real persona in the
west.  Fidel Castro has been little more than a familiar name for a
perpetual nuisance who always looks like he needs a bath, de-lousing and
some deodorant.

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. We have entered a busy season here in
Washington. Soon, Congress will be back in session. I will go to the
Capitol to report on the state of our union and I will present a budget
that sets the priorities of our government for fiscal year 2003.

Our highest priorities are clear to all. We must give our military every
tool and weapon it needs to prevail in the war against terror. We must
strengthen our country's defenses against further attack, with a
comprehensive program of homeland security. And we must get our
country's economy growing and creating jobs once again.

Preserving Freedom, Beating Terror
By Alan Keyes

As we settle in for the long haul in the war against terrorism, we are
establishing the patterns that will determine whether that war secures
or loses our liberty.  Much depends on the kind of contribution average
American citizens make to this effort.  How can we help protect American
liberty, and strengthen it in the process?  Some history will help
answer this question.

After the Second World War, the governing concept of American military
policy shifted from mobilization to readiness, on the assumption that we
had to be ready for conflict, on a relatively large scale, at all times.
 The shift was reasonable, made necessary by the persistent military
challenge from the Soviet Union and the need to protect friends and
interests around the globe.

Lurking Threat Of National ID Card: Can Big Brother Be Stopped?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Unfortunately, it appears that we are inexorably moving toward a
National Identification Card system, an Orwellian nightmare that would
permit easy tracking and surveillance of individuals on a level once
considered unimaginable. It's not happening in a blatant power grab by
government, but in small, incremental steps that nonetheless will have
the same deleterious outcome. Our society is ""slipping and sliding""
toward ""Big Brother"" snoopery with plans for embedding crucial
identification data into microchips on our drivers' licenses. And,
clearly, widespread encroachment upon our privacy is being significantly
abetted by advancing technologies. Understandably, civil libertarians
are sounding the clarion call to alert the general public to the
inherent dangers of a centralized identification system.

Have Gun, Will Travel
By SARTRE

Few topics cause more confusion and emotionalism than the subject of
guns. But before you speculate that this pacifist author is against the
second amendment, consider the nature of the real issue. Guns are simply
an instrument of function. The principle that is part of our heritage,
is the inalienable ability for self defense. This natural right, does
not exist because government has passed a law or grants some privilege.
Protecting your own life and safety is intrinsic to your very existence.
So why do so many people confuse gun ownership with self protection,
when the former is only a means, while the later is an immutable right?

Final Attack on America: The Assault on Her Christian Heritage and
Values
By Dorothy Anne Seese

My greatest fear for the beloved America in which I was born is not from
Islamic terrorists, as brutal as they are in their fierce hatred. (The
media's labeling of them as ""fundamentalists"" is quite ironic, because
fundamentalism is adhering to the core of one's belief system, which
would be an indictment of the Islam of the Qur'an as advocating
terrorism.)

America will never be destroyed from without, whether a few planes are
taken down or not. The recent airport fiascos are a testimony to our
hysteria rather than to the common sense alternative of arming the pilot
and first officer with guns, and the flight attendants with stun guns.
While all the airport boondoggles are wasting time and enormous amounts
of money, the Islamic radicals could be out purchasing surface-to-air
missiles to bring down any flight they wish to target, as some believe
TWA Flight 800 was brought down.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"recording share transactions","Hi Guys,

I've got a question about shares.  This past weekend, Kathleen and I
began setting up the QuickBooks files for GOPUSA.com.  We've got the
checking set up, as well as accounts receivable and accounts payable.

It's going to take a lot of work to document all the 2001 activities
because of lack of records, but at least from June 1, we will be totally
on the ball.

How do we record shares as far as the balance sheet is concerned?
Recall, that currently, GOPUSA.com, Inc. holds 60,000 shares as treasury
stock.  I hold 32,000, and Bill holds 8,000.  However, yesterday, I sold
1,000 shares to Kathleen's parents at $2/share.  Thus, the company will
now hold 59,000 shares, but $2,000 will be coming in.  How do we account
for this?

Take care,

Bobby

"Re: Fuel Oil Vanadium Spec","I don't even like thinking about the last time I had my vanadium checked.



From:	V. Charles Weldon/ENRON@enronXgate on 05/18/2001 03:28 PM
To:	Matthew Tezyk/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@Enron_Development, Mike Coleman/ENRON@enronXgate
cc:	Mark Breese/ENRON@enronXgate, Ed McMichael/ENRON@enronXgate, Mathew Gimble/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Fairley/ENRON@enronXgate 
Subject:	Fuel Oil Vanadium Spec

As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the ""spec"" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. 

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.


Thanks,

Charlie

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Peace at Any Price is Total Capitulation
By Dorothy Anne Seese

We're in a world at war and that isn't really news, nor has it been for
the last several thousand years of human history.  It's just more global
in both impact and in news coverage.

For the United States and North America in general, war that affects
this nation's home soil is new because of the isolation we enjoyed in
the 20th century.  It must be remembered that war on US soil was common
from the American Revolution through the War between the North and
South.  It was conventional war, even primitive compared to today's
technological warfare, but death is death, whether by musket, by nuclear
weapons, or by bioterrorism.

What we must remember is that peace at any price isn't peace and will
never result in anything other than more bloodshed.  ""Cleansing""
practices, particularly of a vanquished enemy where there has been
long-standing hatred, is common practice and has been since the
beginning of recorded history.  So-called ""peaceniks"" and the
mentally-manipulated students who generally fall for the socialist line
of drivel would do well to remember that the only reason they're free to
be peaceniks is that wars were fought to preserve their right to speak
out.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I'm speaking to you today from Shanghai,
China, at an international meeting of Pacific Rim nations where we are
continuing to enlist the resources of the civilized world in our war
against terrorism.

I am meeting with leaders from China and Mexico, Russia and Canada,
Australia and Japan, and many other friends, allies, and trading
partners.  We're discussing ways to cooperate to improve intelligence,
freeze funding, and better track down terrorist groups.  We're also
discussing ways to better protect all our citizens from a new threat,
the threat of bioterrorism.

America has now confirmed several different cases of anthrax exposure in
Florida, New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.  I commend the many
health and law enforcement officials who have worked quickly to identify
people who may have been exposed, and provide preventative antibiotic
treatment.  Their quick work has no doubt saved lives.

Controlling Our Fear
By Alan Keyes

The nature, scope and source of the anthrax assault on the United States
may be much more evident by the time you read this.  Already, it is
clear that the scattered, partially successful attempts to distribute
the deadly spores have had some success in frightening millions of
people who have no reasonable likelihood of being affected. Some are
calling for authorities to restrict or even suppress reporting of
additional cases, lest the fear spread, or become a panic.  But this
kind of response to adversity is incompatible with the requirements of
liberty or self-government.  The situation we must confront should make
us all ask ourselves who is finally responsible for controlling our
fear. It is a question with serious implications for a free people.

Bravery is the virtue of having the right amount of fear, and
confidence, in the face of real danger, and of acting accordingly. It
requires reason and disciplined passions. This is a combination we
should know something about in the land of the free and the home of the
brave.

Smallpox As Bioterrorism: A Major Threat Looms
By Carol Devine-Molin

Although this nation is beset by anthrax anxiety, it's important to
place the current threat in perspective. To date, only the offices of a
few politicians and big media outlets appear to have been targeted by
anthrax mailings. And, despite the apoplectic reaction from many, the
anthrax assault has resulted in only one death, with a handful of
individuals manifesting the disease, and approximately forty others
tested and found to exhibit asymptomatic exposure to the substance.
Clearly this is a form of bioterrorism, with Islamic fanatics considered
the prime suspects by most, although some perpetrators of hoaxes and
copycat activities are under investigation as well.

ANTHRAX: Why Such a Panic?
By Gregg Bish

The panic over anthrax is more a sign of the times than a sign of fear
at terrorist activity.

Listening to the news on Saturday morning TV, one could come away with
the notion that every other person in the US was infected with anthrax,
and those not infected were exposed. All of the major news outlets, CBS,
NBC, ABC, Fox and CNN carried at least one headline news article
regarding the anthrax scare.

It is a sign of the times that one death, less than a dozen infections,
and fewer than a hundred exposures would set the emotional and financial
well-being of the nation on its ear.

We have forgotten much.

Hijacking the Language of Terrorism
By Doug Patton

""War is peace.  Freedom is slavery.  Ignorance is strength."" -- From the
novel, 1984, by George Orwell

Some believe that the terror of Orwell's masterful 1949 vision - with
its two-way ""telescreens"" installed in every home, constantly reminding
citizens that ""Big Brother is watching"" - lay in its portrayal of the
absolute totalitarian control of every citizen's movements.

As one who deals in the nuance of language, I have always found the
prospect of ""Newspeak"" much more troubling.  Newspeak was an entire
language Orwell created for the construction of the world of 1984.
Instead of evolving, as most language does, Newspeak devolved with each
passing year, until words once taken for granted no longer existed, had
been replaced by something entirely different (or completely opposite)
in meaning or had no meaning at all.  Hence, the slogan, ""War is
peace...freedom is slavery...ignorance is strength.""

Over the last twenty years, political correctness has brought Newspeak
to our modern world.  Many of us viewed it as mere silliness or a
passing fad.  No more.  Newspeak has come with a vengeance to America
and to its war on terror.

The Harsh Economic Costs of 911
By SARTRE

Now that the task of recovery has begun in earnest, we need to evaluate
the after effects of the earth shattering massacre. With estimates well
over 100 Billion Dollars for New York City alone, we are in store for
some major realignments in the national economy. The federal government
will subsidize and grant a large portion of these funds. Coming out of
our pockets is nothing new for most of us. But the underlying changes to
the functions of the Capitalistic order, may well be much more
significant in the long run.

First it needs to be noted that the economic system that now goes under
the 'so called' title of Capitalism, no longer conforms to even an
expanded definition of Free Enterprise. The reality of economic life in
the United States can best be understood as an alliance of the
Corporations/MoneyInterest/Government Axis. The central structures that
serve as the positional referent, is the nature of this axis. The
beneficiaries of this confederation are owners, managers, employees,
investment bankers, security brokers, speculators, investors,
politicians, bureaucrats, judges and lawyers. Their degrees of benefit
are not equal, but each has a vestige interest in protecting the
functions of the present 'status quo'. Resistance to meaningful reform
or fundamental realignment is at the core of most policy decisions.

"FW: Very Notional Gas Basis Bids for Abraxas","Charlie,

They basically want to fix the NYMEX and Basis for a potential VPP transaction.

This is pretty straight forward.  Just set up swap model, one for each of the points listed below.  Use the indicated 5,000 mmbtu/d as the volume.  It will be a 10 year deal, with the quotes split out for each of the first 5 years and then one number for the tail.

This would be a good one to talk to Dutch about (individual yearly quotes vs. one swap quote).  We might also want to have the same discussion with the basis traders.

Tenn (S.Brawner)- we need to know which leg (assume for now Zone L-500 leg)
Ship (Eric Bass) - is Houston Ship Channel
TETCO STX (S.Brawner)
Transco Z1 (S.Brawner)

Once you have the model built let me know and this afternoon we can talk to the traders.

Eric,

We are doing our first preliminary look at a VPP with Abraxas.  Please provide me with very notional gas basis numbers for the below  points.  I will have more to add, but it will be next week.  If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.

 	 	    Dear Charlie,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.     International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us live reports on Tuesday from the 115th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria.  Wolfgang had a live interview with OPEC President Chakib Khelil in the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Khelil discussed OPEC production, Western demand, and prices.  If you missed the interview, catch it in its entirety in ENL's Video Library.  We'll have more live coverage on Wednesday, and we're scheduled to have an exclusive interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  Log on Wednesday for extensive coverage from Vienna.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to resume its markup of the Electricity Emergency Relief Act Wednesday morning.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford and I will be following the markup as well as the official power shift expected in the Senate tomorrow.  Also from Washington on Wednesday, Interior Secretary Gale Norton is scheduled to testify before the House Resources Committee to defend the Bush administration's national energy policy.  Norton is expected to discuss access to federal lands for energy exploration with ANWR entering into the discussion.  We'll keep you updated on these and other stories from the Washington bureau on Wednesday.   From the Houston bureau on Wednesday, Correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to bring us a report on training programs some companies are implementing to prepare high school and college students for careers in the energy industry.

We'll have all this and more from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   Also on Wednesday, President and Chairman of Beta Oil and Gas Steve Antry is scheduled to join us in studio.  Beta Oil and Gas expects revenues ranging from $18 million to $22 million this year, with projections based on continued drilling of around  10 new wells a quarter.

Well it is finally decided, we are leaving for Billings, Montana Wednesday  be back Sunday.  Saw 1 by 0 the other day and another spike that needed  killing.  I ask the Game Biologist what procedure to take to get permission  to kill them.  He said to put the cross hairs on them and pull the trigger,  but first call the game warden and find out where he is.  Lot of  help.  Dad

Over the last few months I have often used this radio time to advocate major tax relief. Today I'm pleased to report success. Soon Congress will send me a bill reducing federal income taxes by $1.35 trillion over the next 11 years, and I will proudly sign it.    Under the new law, more than 98 million Americans who pay income taxes will be owed a refund. This year, most single taxpayers will receive checks for $300; single-parent taxpayers will receive up to $500; and married couples will receive a check for up to $600. Over the next 10 years, the per-child tax credit will double, from $500 to $1,000; the marriage penalty will be reduced; and the death tax will be completely abolished.    Some other provisions of the tax bill haven't received quite as much attention. But they will make a great difference in the lives of many Americans. For low-income families, the child tax credit will now by partially refundable. Right now, many poor families don't qualify for the credit because they don't pay income taxes at all. Soon, they will receive a tax credit to help meet the cost of raising their children.   Read and listen to the complete radio address at http://gopusa.com/bush/radio19.html    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]IS ""THE CONTENDER"" HOW HOLLYWOOD REALLY SEES CONSERVATIVES?  By Doug Patton   I always assume a liberal bias in movies; it's just a given. However, political junkie that I am, I defied my better judgment recently by renting a video entitled ""The Contender"" and settling in with my popcorn and a guardedly open mind for a Friday evening of Washington intrigue. What I saw can only be described as ""The American President"" meets ""The West Wing"" on steroids.   Virtually every silly clich? Hollywood could conjure about ""The Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy"" was thrown into this plot.   Upon the untimely death of the vice president of the United States, the dashing, handsome, liberal Democrat president nominates an equally liberal female U.S. Senator to fill out the term. This is considered a bold move, since the pundits believe that the president's choice will be the moderate governor of Virginia. But the moderate governor of Virginia has recently tried unsuccessfully to rescue a drowning woman whose car just happened to crash off a bridge right next to where he (the governor) was fishing. This is thought to be too reminiscent of Chappaquidick, and the moderate governor of Virginia is passed over in favor of the liberal female senator.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dougpatton    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]COUNTERFEIT AMERICA, AN IMITATION OF FREEDOM  By Dorothy Anne Seese   The Democrats must have been smoking parts from the new hemp car if they think America can continue to grow without increasing energy resources. ""Conservation"" sounds nice to the liberal Left, but conservation will only work with static growth. Otherwise, conservation merely goes to the point of deprivation for all, and eventually ... at least theoretically ... to none for all.    This is not the America of growth and liberty, it is a liberal counterfeit, a $35 bill being cashed by people who don't understand the truth. Perhaps the reason they don't understand it is that there hasn't been enough genuine freedom in practice for so long that the true cannot be compared to the counterfeit by younger Americans.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dorothyanneseese    [IMAGE]  IN ISRAEL, HAWKS AND DOVES NEST TOGETHER  By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff  Founder, Jews For Life   When doves cry, war is imminent.   Yasser Arafat probably committed his most egregious political error in years.   The latest suicide bombing, killing at least 18 Israeli citizens, most of them teens, was planned with calculated precision to force an excessive Israeli defensive counterattack. The strategy of the Palestinian authority since the Holy War began has been die, and let die. They know that after the bloodshed becomes a memory, any defensive maneuvers by Israelis will be met with condemnation from the rest of the world.   The terrorists have accelerated their suicide bombing missions knowing full well that their cowardly and despicable acts will be met with less hostility than will the Israeli governments' retributions. While the Israelis are desperate and know they must protect their embattled tiny little country, the PLO knows we are in the midst of an energy crisis. In this game of who's got the oil, the Arabs are holding the ball.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/opinion/bcr_060201.html    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE] SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. A few days from now I will go before
Congress to report on the state of the union, and lay out my priorities
for the coming year and beyond. These priorities reflect a single,
overarching commitment: To enhance the security of America and its
people.

Legal Kill
By Alan Keyes

For a reason I will mention below, this past week was a most appropriate
time to focus again on the nature of the evil that struck America on
Sept. 11.

The terrorist destruction of that day was evil in many ways, but at the
heart of its evil was the deliberate deadly assault on innocent human
life. The root of the word ""innocent"" reveals that the notion of
innocence is connected to harmlessness. An innocent person is a person
who does no harm. And we see immediately that there is a special quality
of wickedness in premeditated violence against such people.

Camp X-Ray Allegations Lack Substance
By Carol Devine-Molin

Never mind that initial reports circulating within the UK regarding Camp
X-Ray prison conditions were unverified and patently fallacious. That
did not stop the British tabloids from reveling in a full-fledged media
frenzy in recent days, spewing sensational headlines proclaiming
so-called ""torture"" and ""inhumane"" treatment of the 158 Taliban and
al-Qaeda fighters being held at Camp X-Ray, located within the US Navy
Base at Guantanamo Bay, just outside of Cuba. Sadly, European
""America-bashing"" has reared its ugly head once again, and is now
accompanied by similar odious sentiments from some quarters in our own
nation.

And now... a word from our sponsor...

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

The Philosophic Foundation for Politics
By SARTRE

At the risk of disturbing the slumber of the lethargic, the case in
favor of politics needs to be made. With the distraction that passes for
understanding, few have a grasp on the nature of social relations.
Politics is normally defined as the activities or affairs of government.
But it really is the art of human relations, applied to the organization
of society. The basis for government grows out of the perceived need to
establish order. Rules are the results of a desire to construct a road
map for society to function. The confusion that litters the highways,
rests upon a false understanding of how those arteries are constructed
and where they are going. The philosophy of politics can supply the
answer.

Morality has Tanked Around the World
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Let me see if this can be put as bluntly as possible ... tact isn't my
specialty anyway.

When sex and sex activities, straight or perverted, dominate a culture,
that culture is on its way to the sewer, washing all the people involved
with it (and sweeping along those who protested) into the vast
wastewaters of the planet.

Time to Go
By Timothy Rollins

In what can only be described as time to go, former Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretary of State Colin Powell has shown that
he is (a), too much a soldier, (b), not enough a diplomat or statesman,
and (c), a liability when it comes to the handling of the 158 detainees
that are currently being held at the United States Naval Base at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Their current situation as to their being handled
was well described my friend and colleague Robert Yoho in his column
last Friday, which I would recommend highly for your reading.

Airport Security: Top Down? Or Bottom Up?
By Douglas Brown

When I opened the Lincoln Log set with my five-year old daughter, she
immediately grabbed the brightly colored green roof. She demanded that I
start building the log fort as depicted on the container from the top
down. My first attempt to follow her orders brought a puzzled look. My
second attempt brought an angry scowl. My final attempt brought a
giggling reproach for being so silly.

The tendency to want to do things from the top down is not limited to
five-year olds. It is also the preferred method of problem solving in
Washington, D.C.

To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

 	 	    Dear Charlie,  It's official: Sen. Jim Jeffords is leaving the Republican Party and declares himself an Independent.  This move is going to have repercussions touching aspects in every area of legislation, and will undoubtedly affect the national energy policy.  We'll continue to update you on this situation from our Washington bureau.     Republicans and Democrats are nearing an agreement on the Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  Compromise language is being discussed behind closed doors, and members hope to resolve their differences when the markup continues Friday morning.   In a continuing effort to promote the Bush administration's energy plan, the Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to travel to a nuclear power plant in Maryland on Friday.  Correspondent Peter Cook is scheduled to be along for the ride.  Tuesday, Peter brings us details of his trip to Maryland.    Also on Friday, I'm scheduled to speak with U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President of Energy Policy William Kovacs. He'll join us from Washington, D.C. to preview an energy meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce where Vice President Dick Cheney will talk about the White House energy plan.  Catch my interview with Kovacs in the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.     ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to give us an update from the ongoing story of 70,000 royalty owners who are filing a class action lawsuit against ExxonMobil.  The royalty owners allege Exxon unfairly determined the royalties they should receive from natural gas and natural gas liquids sales.  On Wednesday, a San Antonio U.S. District Judge certified the lawsuit filed by a Houston law firm.  Gale says the Houston bureau will bring you reactions from Exxon officials on Friday.     Dorothea El Mallakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development is also scheduled to join us from our Houston bureau.  She says conservation is not synonymous with deprivation, and the current energy issue is not a problem with a quick solution.  We'll bring you more from Mallakh in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  I'm pleased to report that our nation
continues to takeimportant steps in the war against terrorism.  Next
week, the House of Representativeswill be voting on an airline security
bill that Congressman Don Young has introduced.

It was modeled after proposals I made last month.  Under the Young bill,
the federalgovernment will assume complete control of airport security
and screening.  It alsogreatly expands the Federal Air Marshal program,
and provides substantial new fundingfor secure cockpits and other
security measures aboard airplanes.

There's a critical difference between the Young bill and the bill the
Senate passed a fewweeks ago.  My approach gives the government the
flexibility it needs to assemble askilled and disciplined screening work
force.

Permanent Principles of Liberty
By Alan Keyes

Our current national travails have provoked much talk of a new spirit of
""trusting government."" Certainly, it is important and desirable that the
citizens of a nation at war have confidence and trust in their
government. We should be mindful, however, that this need for trust cuts
both ways.  War tends necessarily to increase the concentration of power
in the federal government, and particularly in the executive branch.

In a free republic, such times as war increase as well the necessity
that citizens trust their own judgment. Even as we willingly accept the
increased energy of the government in those areas where it is truly
necessary, we must increase as well our vigilant insistence that
government power respect the permanent principles of liberty. The
particular danger in times of war or crisis is that the legitimate need
for energetic government action will provide cover for those who, from
vice or ignorance, seek to expand government power at the expense of the
very liberty which it is government's purpose to secure.

Torturing Terrorists For Information?
By Carol Devine-Molin

Recent media reports indicate that the FBI is frustrated, noting
difficulties in extracting information from approximately 150 suspected
terrorists that remain in custody pursuant to the September 11th  ""Day
of Infamy"". Among the many zipped-mouthed individuals, there is detainee
Zacarias Moussaoui, a Moroccan national with close ties to the 9/11
hijackers and allegedly key in the current investigation. How should the
FBI address this thorny predicament of silent suspects?  Interestingly,
the idea of resorting to ""torture"" of suspects is being publicly floated
at this juncture, which should give us pause. This is possibly a public
relations ""trial balloon"" by the government, in order to calibrate
American response to what may become an unsavory reality of war, and to
""psychologically inoculate"" Americans before accounts begin to surface.

Empowerment, Not Enfeeblement: The Citizen Response to Terrorism
By Gregg Bish

Our nation is wrapped in a deep, emotionally wrought debate over
controlling terrorism. Nightly talk television programs are filled,
start to finish, over individuals and organizations advocating
everything from outright racial profiling directed at Arab appearing
individuals to hiring thirty thousand federal shock police to stand post
at the luggage check-in and security portals. The Bill of Rights
trembles in its very frame at the stampede of good intentions and short
wit directed its way.

It can be expected that following any trauma, the public will respond
with its emotions showing sharply on its sleeve. Following the events of
September 11, the American public is responding clothed in panic. Such
are these good intentioned and feeble minded suggestions on how our
government ought to deal with terrorism, a tunic of fear.

The 'Loyalist Tale' - American Tories
By SARTRE

""I voluntarily take this OATH to bear Faith and true Allegiance to His
MAJESTY KING George the Third; - and defend to the utmost of my Power,
His sacred Person, Crown and Government, against all Persons
whatsoever.""

Words like these may seem strange to inhabitants of the twenty first
century, but to citizenry of the revolutionary period, this was the
making of serious discourse. Just hollow rhetoric, or was this sentiment
of the day, a fair reflection by a significant portion of the
population?

The UN Speaks
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The United Nations wants the US to cease hostilities in Afghanistan
until it can get water, food and supplies to the people, particularly
the children.  Oh my here we go.  I don't recall the UN issuing any
mandates to the terrorists, whoever they are, or their supporting
nations, to halt terrorist attacks on the US, including bioterrorism,
until they could make sure no American children would be harmed.

Who Are the Heroes?
By Star Parker

During these difficult times, it is beautiful and energizing for me to
watch my fellow Americans refocus on the powerful principles that
makeour country so great. I know, as I see the flags flying and the red,
white, and blue lapel pins now widely sported, that we are indeed a
nation under God, exalting and realizing the will of the Creator as each
of us fulfill our unique destinies as free men and women.

Yet, in the midst of this, I am also saddened and dismayed by things I
am hearing from some of my fellow citizens and from some of our allies'
abroad. What type of thinking could conclude that the horrendous,
murderous act that occurred on September 11th can be justified in any
way and that somehow, this grotesque behavior is our fault? What type
ofthinking could possibly conclude that a cowardly act, resulting in the
murder of innocent men, women, and children, is religious or heroic?

If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Charlie,

Please find attached two files that contain information for gas swap pricing for the following deals:

1.	NICOR
2.	Anadarko (Carthage)

We have put notes at the bottom of each page to help clarify our request.  A notional price is fine for right now, let me know if you have any questions.  

Thanks for your help,

Subject:	Fuel Oil Vanadium Spec

As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the ""spec"" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. 

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.


Thanks,

Charlie

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

So if you would like to contribute in buying a wedding gift for her you can stop by my desk today or tomorrow with your money.

New Poll shows the Existence of Political Bias on Ivy League Faculties

David Horowitz, President of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture
today released a poll taken on the beliefs and attitudes of Ivy League
professors.

The survey, conducted by the Luntz Research Companies, reveals a
disturbing lack of intellectual diversity among the Ivy League
professors polled, and raises questions about political bias in the
hiring of faculty at schools training America's future elites. The
survey was conducted among professors on the social science and liberal
arts faculties at the schools.

David Horowitz said, ''This survey confirms what I have been saying for
years -- that our universities are less intellectually free than they
were even in the McCarthy era, when I was an Ivy League undergraduate
myself.''

A Closer Look at Somalia
By Austin Bay

It would be rhetorically elegant -- and a profoundly simpler diplomatic
issue -- if Somalia mimicked Julius Caesar's assessment of Gaul and
merely split into three parts.

It doesn't. Anarchic Somalia is arguably the planet's foremost ""failed
state,"" with Afghanistan and the Congo as basket-case competitors. Find
a sub-clan with a savvy leader, or a gang on a street corner, and you
have what passes for governing structure in much of Mogadishu and its
environs.

As Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz noted, Somalia attracts Al
Qaeda ""precisely because the government is weak or nonexistent.""
American counter-terror ""options"" there are limited, Wolfowitz added,
since ""by definition you don't have a government you can work with.""

The Ugly Business of Profiling
By Linda Chavez

Racial profiling is an ugly business -- and I have been on record
opposing it for years. But I'm not opposed to allowing -- no, requiring
-- airlines to pay closer attention to passengers that fit a terrorist
profile, which includes national origin. The problem is distinguishing
between what is permissible, indeed prudent, behavior and what is merely
bigotry. As the Christmas day incident involving an Arab American Secret
Service agent who was denied passage on an American Airlines makes
clear, it's not always easy to tell the difference.

Racial profiling entails picking someone out for special scrutiny simply
because of his race. It happens when highway patrolmen pull over blacks
who've committed no traffic violations for spot checks but ignore other
drivers who share similar characteristics, say out-of-state plates or
expensive cars. It happens when security guards at a mall tail black
customers in stores or insist on inspecting only their bags, ignoring
whites. The underlying presumption in these cases is that blacks are
more likely to be involved in criminal acts because of the color of
their skin.

Breaux Let The Dogs Out
By Mike Bayham

Last Thursday, gubernatorial front-runner and current US Senator John
Breaux announced that he would not be a candidate in the 2003 Louisiana
governor's race.  Breaux had previously been heralded as an unstoppable
candidate by political pundits and at varying times appeared to be a
likely contender.

Evidence of his early support could be found in the parking lot of the
hotel where he held his press conference in which there were several
cars sporting bumper stickers that read ""Breaux for Governor.""  However,
the best hope for the Democrats to take back the governor's office opted
out of the race stating that he can better serve Louisiana by remaining
in the US Senate.

Terror War: Phase 2
By Nicholas M. Horrock and Dennis Lewis

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UPI) -- While U.S. forces continue to search for
Osama bin Laden and al Qaida members, the Bush administration has
quietly shifted its priority to attacking terrorism in Somalia, Yemen,
Indonesia and the Philippines, sources say.

The United States currently has intelligence operations in those four
nations, selected because they expressed willingness to cooperate. Their
countries also have vast lawless areas where al Qaida and other
terrorist cells are known to have operated, well-placed administration
and congressional sources tell United Press International.

*** Re: The Rumsfeld Mystique: Understanding His Popularity (Carol
Devine-Molin)

A well written article, and so timely.  I've been a Rumsfeld groupie,
since 9/11 when he didn't run from the disaster at the Pentagon, but
plunged into the wreckage to save people.  Also, he sent his 2nd in
charge to the bomb shelter, because he was too old to be that valuable.
My husband, brother and I have enjoyed the ex-mil men, Vietnam, ""
retrain me, send me, leave my kids who are fathers at home, keep the
adolescents and post-adol's at home."" These men were in physical shape,
and morally ready to take on the enemy.  Their righteous anger, and love
of country, create that great interior smile.

We had about an inch of rain.  The water was just  beginning to run out at the ranch when I left but I think that it stopped  raining before it really got started.  I was rotorcycling in the front and  was going to keep on until the lighting started hitting all around  me. 
 
Talked to Travis this morning and he will be coming here  around the 18th of June the way it looks now.
 
What is wrong with Enron Stock?  Wish I had some money to  spend on it when it gets to 48.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million

Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Lone Star Shoot out; High Noon in Houston
By Jack Rains
Former Texas Secretary of State
Campaign Chairman, Orlando Sanchez for Mayor

On December 1, history will be made in Houston. A hotly contested run
off in Houston's Mayoral election pits a fiscal conservative Republican
Orlando Sanchez against a two-term incumbent, liberal Democrat, Lee
Brown, former Drug Czar to President Bill Clinton. The challenger,
Sanchez, has a slight lead in the race, and Democrats all over the
country are rallying to try and save Brown.

Houston, America's fourth largest city, and the southeast Texas region
it dominates, accounts for roughly one third of the Texas vote total and
is a rich area for political contributions. Houston accounts for over a
third of all the political money raised in Texas in both parties. In a
strong Mayor form of government, such as Houston has, the mayor with a
$1.5 Billon annual budget, and controlling half as much again through
appointments to Boards and Commissions, exercises great influence over
the business community, and their political activity.

Editor's Note: Please do whatever you can to help Orlando Sanchez in
this race.  I have known Orlando for over six years and worked on his
first city council race.  He is a solid conservative and someone who
will represent Houston with honor.  We need to get rid of Lee Brown now!
You saw what he did as drug czar under Bill Clinton (absolutely
nothing), and that's exactly what he's done for Houston.  Please
contribute what you can to help elect a conservative as the next Mayor
of Houston.

========================================================================
And now... a word from our sponsor...

ORLANDO SANCHEZ FOR MAYOR

A Houstonian since 1962, Houston City Council Member Orlando Sanchez has
a long track record of public service to Houston and his country.

Please support Orlando Sanchez in his runoff election against liberal
Democrat Lee Brown on December 1.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address
Delivered by First Lady Laura Bush

Laura Bush: Good morning. I'm Laura Bush, and I'm delivering this week's
radio address to kick off a world-wide effort to focus on the brutality
against women and children by the al-Qaida terrorist network and the
regime it supports in Afghanistan, the Tablian. That regime is now in
retreat across much of the country, and the people of Afghanistan -
especially women - are rejoicing. Afghan women know, through hard
experience, what the rest of the world is discovering: The brutal
oppression of women is a central goal of the terrorists. Long before the
current war began, the Taliban and its terrorist allies were making the
lives of children and women in Afghanistan miserable. Seventy percent of
the Afghan people are malnourished. One in every four children won't
live past the age of five because health care is not available. Women
have been denied access to doctors when they're sick. Life under the
Taliban is so hard and repressive, even small displays of joy are
outlawed - children aren't allowed to fly kites; their mothers face
beatings for laughing out loud. Women cannot work outside the home, or
even leave their homes by themselves.

Wheaton group says AT&T Broadband Ignoring Demand for Fox News Channel
By Dan Zanoza, GOPUSA News Contributor

Chicago, IL (GOPUSA) -- Since the Fox News Channel (FNC) went on the air
in 1996, viewer demand for the cable news service, with popular hosts
like Bill O'Reilly, has increased dramatically. The latest ratings show
O'Reilly defeating the Cable News Network's (CNN) popular television
host Larry King. O'Reilly's success in the ratings is especially
significant because FNC is available in far fewer households than CNN.
For example, AT&T Broadband, the nation's largest cable company, with
nearly 14.4 million subscribers and 94 percent of the Chicagoland
market, does not carry FNC for about 50 percent of the Chicagoland
households the company serves, including those in Wood Dale, Palos Park
and Wheaton.

Dave Diersen, spokesman for a group called ""Wheaton for FNC"" told GOPUSA
thousands of AT&T Broadband's current and former subscribers, in
municipalities where the company does not carry FNC, have asked for the
channel, but the company continues to ignore their requests. It has been
reported a number of elected officials, including Illinois Senate
President Pate Philip, Wood Dale; state Senator and gubernatorial
candidate Patrick O'Malley, Palos Park; Senator Peter Roskam and
Representative Randall Hultgren, Wheaton, have joined the call for AT&T
Broadband to include FNC to its cable lineup in the aforementioned
areas. The company recently replaced its Chairman & CEO and announced
that it would increase its cable prices by 5.5 percent on January 1,
2002. Its parent, AT&T, is attempting to sell the company.

Teaching the Truth
By Alan Keyes

The burgeoning movement to restore to our school children an
understanding of America's historic heritage, our founding documents and
the principles that underlie our way of life, has come just in time.
Nothing is more important than restoring clarity in the minds of our
young people about the crucial role that each and every citizen plays in
the life of this Republic.

Throughout human history, self-government by the people has been almost
non-existent.  Ours is the first great nation to sustain an experiment
in this kind of self-government over the course of centuries.  Our
founders understood that the effort to establish a government based on
the consent of the governed was exceptional and difficult.

Because of the success of the experiment, we have had a tendency to take
it for granted.  But to live under a regime that respects the rights and
dignity of all, where we each have some share of participation in the
decisions that shape the destiny of our community and our future, is a
blessing ? an extraordinary blessing.  It will be a fatal mistake if we
continue to take it for granted.

Bush Superbly Cleans Up Clinton's Mess
By Carol Devine-Molin

As of this writing, the Taliban forces are in full retreat, as critical
cities, Mazar-e-Sharif, and the capital Kabul, are now firmly under the
control of the American-backed insurgents from the Northern Alliance.
The cities of Kandahar and Jalalabad are about to topple, with the
Taliban fleeing to the mountains in an attempt to re-group and launch
guerrilla style attacks upon their enemies.

Contemporaneously, US Special Operations troops are in keen pursuit and
zeroing in on Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network. And the
worst fears of the civilized world were confirmed upon the discovery of
a nuclear device blueprint found at a bombed-out al Qaeda safe house in
Kabul. This blueprint, and other documents unearthed at that site,
represent a US intelligence bonanza, verifying that bin Laden's
organization indeed has access to fissile materials for the construction
of nuclear and radiological weaponry. Moreover, in anticipation that
suspected terrorists will be apprehended forthwith, President Bush has
signed an executive order establishing a military tribunal to try these
murderous thugs.

Vladmir Putin: Formidable Man, Friend or Foe
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Who is this man who came out of political nowhere to lead the new
Russia? He certainly is not the vodka-sotted puppet that Boris Yeltsin
was during his years as so-called president of Russia.

Until his appearance as the new Russian president, Putin spent most of
his career as a member of the KGB.  He doesn't look like a mean man, he
doesn't have the evil look of Stalin, Khruschev, or any number of
Arab/Islamic leaders.  Actually, his face is rather bland, at times
almost boyish.  Good spies, which is what Putin was for many years,
never look like Hollywood's idea of a spy.  And not all devastating
leaders look like Saddam Hussein or the late Ayatollah Khomeini (who
looked like an escapee from an insane ward).

Farewell to Arms
By Gregg Bish

Much has changed in the world, much that some find distasteful, and that
others find poignant and sweet. Times have changed enough, however, that
time has come to re-evaluate the shape of the world. Much good has come
to pass. Much more is coming.

Our nation was stabbed in the heart with a bitter dagger September 11.
The wound was deep. Rather more like a cancer patient hearing of the
onset of a dread disease than a victim of a vicious assault, however,
America responded. The response surprised many, though often those who
were surprised were younger, less informed and less understanding types,
whose life experience has been limited to a world shaped in the days
following the Viet Nam War. It has seemed uncanny to these types that
America, instead of blindly lashing out, or retreating into a forced,
brooding isolationism, has been reborn.

The Laughing Sheiks of Saudi Arabia
By Doug Patton

""The American government... stands by its commitment to a just peace in
the Middle East.  We are working toward the day when two states - Israel
and Palestine - live peacefully together within secure and recognized
borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions.""
George W. Bush, 43rd President of the United States, addressing the
United Nations General Assembly, Nov. 10, 2001

With those few words, President Bush ushered in a new era and a new
American attitude toward Israel.  No American president has ever used
the term ""Palestine"" to refer to anything other than the area of the
Middle East occupied by Great Britain until 1948, at which time that
occupied territory became the sovereign state of Israel.  Our official
position has always been to speak in terms of a prospective ""Palestinian
state"" or a ""Palestinian homeland,"" but never of ""Palestine.""

Inner City 101 in Israel's Defense
By Star Parker

Not again. Will not even the assassination of Israeli Cabinet Member
Rehavam Zeevi spark renewed loyalty from America to defend our friends?

In looking for the right answer regarding those that President Bush has
called our friends, maybe Secretary of State Colin Powell should take a
lesson from inner city gang members.

""I got your back"" is a popular summary as to why these street thugs so
willingly go to jail or die for their hommies. The saying means that
even when the road gets tough, you can depend on me.

New World Disorder Psychology
By SARTRE

Events since 911 have created a deep seeded dread towards the future in
the minds of many Americans. What was attacked on that day was not
buildings alone. The deaths that were snuffed out were not the only
victims from the act of terror. The feeling of anguish has overtaken
much of the public psyche, as the tone of the continuous reporting and
reflection has exposed an uncertainty, that few would have admitted,
just a short time ago. Control over your environment and circumstances
is a goal that most strive to achieve. In the fleeting moments by an act
of absurd action and applied depravity, security of our world view was
shattered.

2001: A Year in Review

GOPUSA is proud to present ""2001: A Year in Review.""

We hope you enjoy this presentation of the events of 2001 set to music
and pictures. In addition to showing pictures taken throughout the year,
this animation also contains our tribute to the victims of the September
11 attacks.

The animationis approximately 3 Mb, so a broadband connection is best.
However, it should also work quite well on a 56 Kb modem connection.

Looking to 2002
By Linda Chavez

Remember when practically everybody -- even some people who voted for
him -- thought maybe George W. Bush wasn't smart enough to be president?
""He looked like some bozo at a church bazaar who sticks his head in a
cutout hole while you get three shots at hitting him with a fastball,""
columnist Pete Hamill wrote back on August 13, a few days after the
president gave a prime-time speech on stem cell research. ""He paused
after every sixth or seventh word, as if afraid of skipping the next
line in his script,"" Hamill sneered. Well, nobody's sneering now.

I'm putting ""Why George W. Bush is too Dumb to Be President"" at the top
of my list of stories you won't read in 2002. Here are some others:

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

I have right now.""

The Conflict Epidemic
By Austin Bay

It was February 1990, three months after the Berlin Wall cracked and the
Cold War began to melt. Following my lecture, she approached me in the
school hallway. Despite the crowsfeet around her eyes, a tattling detail
that pegged her on the high side of 40, she had decked herself in the
perennially adolescent costume of a 1960s hippie: bandanna in the
frizzed hair, faded blue jeans, and a pearl-button shirt best described
as vaguely Navaho and LSD.

She smiled self-consciously, then raised a scold's finger: ""You write
books about war, right? With the end of the Cold War and so many people
waging peace, I guess you'll have to find another subject, eh?""

Post-Christmas Wrap-Up
By Frederick Meekins

Each year I write at least one column detailing the ongoing assault
against Christmas throughout Western society.  Usually this affront is
led by a gaggle of secularists, liberals, and multiculturalists.
However, this year there seems to be a festering opposition led by
certain Christians to the yuletide season. Even though these criticisms
have not yet risen to the level of disruptive street theater engaged in
by their unbelieving counterparts, they nevertheless reveal a somewhat
dubious ecclesio-social philosophy.

The basic Christian anti-Christmas argument runs something like this:
since the commemoration of Christmas is not explicitly commanded by
Scripture, its celebration is therefore forbidden.  Furthermore, since
certain aspects of the holiday might be traceable to pagan origins, the
committed Christian is obligated to have no parts of them.

"Summer Buddies","

Dear Intern Buddy - 

Thank you for volunteering to assist the Analyst/Associate Program with candidate cultivation this summer.   Summer internships are very important to the overall success of our program and we need your help to insure that our interns have enjoyable and meaningful experiences this summer. 

We have assigned you to be Michael Finger's summer buddy.   

To kick off the summer, the A/A Program will be hosting a ""Meet the Pool"" party on Thursday June 7th at the Hyatt Regency from 5:00PM to 9:00 PM.

We would like for you to use this opportunity to meet your summer buddy and to introduce them to others in the pool.  Please make contact with your buddy as soon as possible to make plans to attend the party together. 

In addition to attending this party together, we would like for you to spend a little time each week with your buddy.    We will send out an email next week with some suggested things for you and your buddy to do together.  Whether it is lunch or a simple phone call, your continued interaction with these interns could make a difference in the intern's decision to join Enron fulltime.  Suggestions from you are always welcomed!

As we progress through the summer, please make an attempt to gain insight into your buddy's internship.  Any feedback from them regarding their summer experiences will be welcomed, positive or negative.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at x35275.

Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely, 

Ted Bland

"NetcoOnline Launch Plans","
We are getting ready for the launch of ""NetcoOnline"" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch ""NetCoOnline"".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of ""NetCoOnline"" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of ""NetcoOnline""

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, ""NetcoOnline"" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:

 	 	    Dear Charlie,  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale is on his way to the 115th OPEC Conference Tuesday and Wednesday, and is scheduled to speak with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  We'll bring you Wolfgang's exclusive interview with Rodriguez later next week.  Wolfgang also tells us he may have an interview with Senior Energy Analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies Julian Lee.  Log on all next week for updates from Wolfgang's trip.   The House and Senate are back in session next week, and Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford expects a chaotic week of reorganization ahead.  The power shift in the Senate is the big news on Capitol Hill, and Jay anticipates official movement to begin by Tuesday.  The Washington bureau will follow the changes taking place in leadership and the key energy chairmanships.     Jay also says Interior Secretary Gale Norton is scheduled to testify before the House Resources Committee.  She's expected to defend the administration's national energy policy.  Additionally next week, the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on conservation and energy efficiency.  We'll follow these stories and more from the Washington bureau next week.     Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the current boom in the energy industry is creating a need for qualified employees.  Next week Kim is scheduled to take a look at companies implementing training programs for high school and college students that groom them for positions within the industry.     Also from Houston, ENL's Gale Smith brings us a report on minority-owned energy-related businesses.  Gale is scheduled to speak with a Houston businessman who turned his company into a multi-million dollar operation that employs mostly minorities.  The Houston bureau will bring us details next week.   We're also scheduled to talk with Vice President of Omega Oil Company Andy Ashby from Houston next week.  Ashby knows the ins and outs of production methods, and will discuss below the reservoir production, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We're scheduled to speak with Ashby on Tuesday.    I'm leaving for vacation on Friday, and ENL's Stephanie Stanton and Washington Correspondent Peter Cook are sharing anchoring duties next week.  I'm also passing the pen to Peter.  He'll bring you the nightly e-mail wrap while I'm away.      Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

Please welcome... David Horowitz.   David Horowitz is the President of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture. A best-selling author and editor, Horowitz may be best known for his lifelong intellectual and political journey from a radical activist in the '60s to a crusader against the corrosive effects of '60s leftism on modern American culture.

Every poll shows it. The California public -- where most of the political battle to date has been fought -- thinks energy companies are responsible for the crisis and favors price controls -- the Democrats' socialist solution -- by a whopping 70%. We are losing because the Democrats are attacking us with images (""price gouging energy companies"") but we are opposing them with arguments (""it's about supply and demand"") that are over many voters' heads. If you don't think so, consider that 57% of California Republicans also support price controls. We are losing because we haven't told the public that the Democrats and environmental extremists are waging a war against them -- against their prosperity and freedom.   In politics the weapons of battle are sound-bites and images. Images are created by a story. The Democrat story is this: Republicans are in the pockets of greedy oilmen who are gouging the public; Democrats are the friends of the people. Democrats will use government to save consumers from the clutches of greedy oilmen and their politician cronies. Fear is a powerful emotion. If Democrats are allowed to plant these fears in the hearts of the voting public, we will lose the 2002 elections.

Quinn was much more than an actor to me as I was growing up. The first film I ever remember seeing was Elia Kazan's ""Viva Zapata,"" in which Quinn played the brother of Emiliano Zapata, the peasant leader of the Mexican Revolution. Five years old and sitting in the ornate Kimo Theater in Albuquerque, N.M., with my parents, I remember crying out loud in the auditorium Quinn's line as he rode across the screen after Zapata was killed: ""No, no, he's not dead. He's in the mountains with his people."" The movie, whose screenplay was written by John Steinbeck, can be seen on classic movie stations on cable sometimes and still brings tears to my eyes.   Mexican and other Latin actors were relatively common in the '40s and early '50s. Gilbert Roland, Cesar Romero, Desi Arnaz, Ricardo Montalban, Carmen Miranda, Dolores Del Rio and Linda Darnell were romantic leads in many a Hollywood movie. But Quinn stood apart from the others. As he once observed, he rarely got the girl in any of his movies because his looks weren't the classic, fine-featured variety favored for those parts.

The combat pits motley Macedonian government forces -- equipped with mid-20th century military hardware -- against National Liberation Army (NLA) ethnic Albanian guerrillas armed with assault rifles and mortars.   If they're lucky, Macedonian troops and security police ride to the battlefields in trucks. Men move on foot through forests and villages, trying to avoid ambush. In these circumstances, foot soldiers in the 21st century don't move any faster than soldiers in the 17th century.   At times, the weapons employed are genuinely 17th century. On June 4, NLA guerrillas attacked Macedonian positions with explosives loaded on a horse-drawn cart.

For instance, Thursday will be an historic and important day for American taxpayers from coast-to-coast. It's a day when the federal government finally will be required to give you some of your money back. -- on average $1,600 per year per family.   Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-IL), other Congressional leaders, and hard-working taxpaying families will join President Bush at the White House for the official signing of the much-touted tax relief package.

By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff   In the long-awaited sequel to the original horror classic ""The Invisible Man,"" the mercurial Senator John McCain, promoter of the soft money ban with benefits no one could see or understand, returns to his Senate Body. He claims he is no longer masquerading as a Democrat, but has changed back to his original form, as a Republican.   Having recently returned from his weekend jaunt with Senator Tom Daschle (D-S Dak.) Senator McCain has assumed his former identity. As the Beatles once sang, John McCain is ""Back In The USSR"" (United States Senate Republicans).   But not for long, dear friends, not for long?!

By my calculations we have been paying reparations for years. Affirmative action. Welfare. Taxing many and giving to others. If I took money from someone to give to another I would be in jail. Rewarding failure and penalizing success. Blackmail, bribes, extortion etc. carried on by some to get something in return. And none has resolved problem discussed by Ms Chavez.  -- Bob VeigelRe: Jeffords and Vermont I winced when I heard about the extent to which the State of Vermont has become a haven for the counter-culture. The people there can no longer be laid back. You must move to take full control of your legislature as you've already begun to do. Or at least rid the chamber of those seeking to erode the basic principles of God, family and love of country, irrespective of party affiliation.  -- M. Gordon   I think Jeffords was never a conservative much less a Republican and he was just looking for an excuse to jump ship -- if it hadn't been that it would have been something else -- good riddance. But we need to get more Republicans elected in 2002.  -- Frances Shannon, Spring Branch, TXRe: Charlotte Thomson Iserbyt's Comments on Education ABSOLUTELY CORRECT. Pres. Bush is being led down the ""Primrose path"", that road paved with good intentions, on education (where he is expanding the role of the federal government). My guess is that he is inclined to agree with Charlotte Iserbyt, and if so, he should go with his inclinations, not the popular prevailing views in Washington, DC.  -- Brian Lynch, Austin, TXRe: Is ""The Contender"" How Hollywood Really Sees Conservatives? The answer is ""No. This is how they portray conservatives to the public, for the purpose of undermining belief in conservative principles. McCarthy was right, the public was naive, and we are beginning to see more clearly that Hollywood is little more than a ""vast propaganda machine"" for the political ideology of the left. This is a ""causation, not a correlation"", to borrow a term from the statisticians from the election mess. Contrary to their self-serving press, Hollywood no longer writes what the public wants to see. They write what they want the public to believe. Take your pick of platforms, comedy, satire, drama or action / adventure, offerings over recent years have been little more than outright advocacy for world government, leftist ideology, glamorization of the bad behavior of Democratic politicians, and attacks on the constitution and the rights contained therein. If conservatives are going to put this to rights, we need to be less naive about the venom housed in the snakepit of Hollywood. We also need to fund some movies that portray things more accurately.  -- Gregg Bish, Fremont, MichiganRe: Counterfeit America I loved it. Every freedom loving American should be shouting this from the roof tops. I have been telling young people for years that they have lost their freedoms. Most respond with blank stares, a few have told  me ""You're Nuts"".  -- Willard F. Schmehl, Cool, CA   Great column. I look forward to all Dorothy's columns. This one was especially good.  -- Katherine Krehbiel   Counterfeit America, An Imitation of Freedom is a very good article. Everything written in the article is true. What was omitted was the founders of such policies. THE UNITED NATIONS! Of all the primary concerns we citizens each have, please move ""getting the US out of the UN"", then ""getting the UN out of the US"" to the #1 position. This will do more for correcting our national concerns than any other single item. As long as the GOP continues to slowly allow our sovereignty to be given away I will not support the GOP.  -- D. Burch   Way to go Dorothy! MAN it's great to see that there actually IS someone else alive on this planet who has their head screwed on straight!  -- Earl Carter[IMAGE]  [IMAGE] SUBSCRIBE TODAY!

These tickets are in the A&M section which unfortunately are never the best

Eric,

We are doing our first preliminary look at a VPP with Abraxas.  Please provide me with very notional gas basis numbers for the below  points.  I will have more to add, but it will be next week.  If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

Charlie,

Here is an update on Stagecoach:  Tennessee Gas Pipeline had to re-file their case with the FERC, which will unfortunately delay the deal and push it out of Q2 and into Q3 or Q4.  We were told to update the model (and all pricing) so we know where we stand on our valuation at this point.  Can you please update the gas price for us when you have a chance?  The load factors and the associated volumes are unchanged from the last information that we sent to you. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.  

Thanks,

John

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Charlie,  On Tuesday we brought you a segment from Washington Correspondent Peter Cook's visit to Maryland.  Peter was invited to travel with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham while the Secretary toured the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant.  If you missed Peter's report on Sec. Abraham and the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant, log on to ENL's Video Library to view the segment in its entirety.       The House and Senate are on Memorial Day recess for the rest of the week, and they're scheduled to reconvene on June 5.  While it's relatively quiet in Washington, ENL's Washington bureau is keeping an eye on President Bush's trip to California.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says tomorrow they'll have updates from the meeting between the President and Governor Gray Davis.  They'll also continue to follow the President in California as he travels to Fresno and Sequoia National Park on Wednesday.   Also on Wednesday, the FERC is scheduled to conduct a regular meeting.  It is unclear whether newly confirmed FERC Commissioners Nora Brownell and Pat Wood will take part in the meeting.   Finally, from our D.C. bureau on Wednesday, Competitive Enterprise Institute's Christopher Horner is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the Republican Party and the effect this move may have on the national energy policy.  Log on to see the Horner interview in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.     The Houston Bureau is going to shed some light on job availability within the energy industry.  Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the bureau is scheduled to bring us details on the difficulties some companies are having recruiting employees during boom periods.  Kim also reports the bureau is scheduled to bring us a story on an international energy jobs recruiter.  We'll find out what areas of the industry are growing, and where employees are being hired.  The Houston bureau will bring us these and other stories on Wednesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. On Monday, communities across America will
celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Laura will
visit Atlanta to commemorate the day in Dr. King's home town. I will
welcome Dr. King's family to the White House. This year's observance is
an opportunity to celebrate the contributions of Dr. King, and honor the
principles for which he lived and died.

Americans can proudly say that we have overcome the institutionalized
bigotry that Dr. King fought. Now our challenge is to make sure that
every child has a fair chance to succeed in life. That is why education
is the great civil rights issue of our time.

Liberty's Silver Lining
By Alan Keyes

Friends of liberty began this new year in sorrow over the sudden death
of Tom Silver, president and cofounder of the Claremont Institute and
champion of the principles and practice of liberty.  He died suddenly of
an aggressive brain tumor that was only discovered days earlier, but
what we will remember is a life devoted to the service of God, liberty,
country, family and friends.  Men like Tom Silver make liberty possible,
and the privilege of having them as fellow citizens is a great part of
what makes liberty so sweet.

Beyond News Media Bias
By Carol Devine-Molin

""When it comes to arrogance, power, and lack of accountability,
journalists are probably the only people on the planet who make lawyers
look good."" Steven Brill - editor of the now defunct media watchdog
publication ""Brill's Content"".

This aforesaid quote is the opening salvo launched by journalist Bernard
Goldberg in his recently published book, ""Bias"", a provocative tome that
is garnering an array of responses, both in and out of the field of
 journalism. The veteran newsman, and consummate insider, produced a
notable expose that examines entrenched liberal bias in the newsroom,
and the accompanying distortions in the news. What motivated Goldberg to
write a book that was sure to cause much angst in the news business?
 Actually, he has been on this trajectory for several years, sounding
the alarm on numerous occasions, both privately and in the press,
regarding the scourge of the left-leaning news media.

I have right now.""

Statue Squabble Embodies Lies of Racial Preferences
By Marc Levin

After captivating America and the world with its courage and heroism in
putting out the monstrous fire of September 11, the New York City Fire
Department was recently forced to extinguish the flames of a public
relations disaster. Developer Bruce Ratner commissioned a statue for the
FDNY headquarters based on the inspirational photo of firemen Billy
Eisengrein, George Johnson and Dan McWilliams hoisting the American flag
at Ground Zero the afternoon of September 11.

However, there was one modification to Hackensack Record photographer
Thomas E. Franklin's image: the three white firemen morphed into one
white, one black and one Hispanic. Thus, the two white firefighters were
replaced by fictitious firemen of color who did not actually rise from
the rubble and unfurl Old Glory.

Dear Mr. President, There are Still Right-Wing Republicans Out Here
By Dorothy Anne Seese

Perhaps somehow, somewhere, someone in your administration may read
this, President Bush, and let you know that all the conservatives
haven't come to terms with either the globalist agenda or the centrist
policies in this nation.

There are many of us out here in the land of cyberspace who communicate
with each other about the America we feel we are losing.  We are still
Republicans, but we feel our party is leaving us without a voice, other
than that of Ron Paul, in Congress.  Maybe it's time to just organize
our complaints one by one.

Capitalist Owners of the Corporate Economy
By SARTRE

As any school student knows, Capitalism is supposed to be based upon
ownership of a business venture. Whether private or corporate, this
proprietary claim is founded on the principle of property.  To deny the
legitimacy of this right, is to forego the sovereignty of the
individual. For People to be Free, they must retain the right of
ownership, especially as applied to a business. But owning a company
does not guarantee that its control is under your command.

Geneva Convention

Much is being made of the ""status"" of the terrorist prisoners currently
being held in Cuba.  There have been multiple references to the status
of prisoners of war as outlined by the Geneva Convention.

To help folks learn more about these discussions, GOPUSA now has the
Geneva III document available for viewing.  This document pertains
specifically to the treatment of prisoners of war.  We hope you find it

A Brilliant Performance by a Great Leader
By David Horowitz

President Bush gave two speeches in his State of the Union address last
night, which I had the once in a lifetime privilege of viewing from the
gallery. The first was a war speech, the second a campaign speech. Both
were home runs.

The war speech was designed to firm America's resolve. It began with one
of the most powerful opening lines ever delivered on these occasions:
""As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is in
recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the
state of our Union has never been stronger."" These were true words, a
tribute to the resilience and character of the American people, which
had been adrift during the last decade of misleadership by Bush's
predecessor.

Should Israel Take the Gloves Off?
By Linda Chavez

Lightning isn't supposed to strike twice in the same place, but tell
that to Mark Sokolow. Mr. Sokolow survived the attack on the World Trade
Center in September, barely escaping from his 38th floor office when the
second plane hit and the building collapsed. Then on Sunday, Sokolow and
his family were shopping in Jerusalem, where they had gone to visit a
daughter studying there, when a suicide bomber, a Palestinian female,
detonated a device that killed her and one other, and injured scores,
including Sokolow, his wife and two remaining daughters.

A Terrorist by Any Other Name
By Frederick Meekins

In response to the September 11th Attack upon America, the U.S.
government has vowed to wipe terrorism from the face of the earth.  To
some officials, this noble struggle might become nothing more than a
word game of shuffled papers and fluctuating definitions.

Wearing the 'Uniform' of War
By Austin Bay

Every Monday night, I put on my uniform and head for reserve drill.
However, it's not the uniform per se that makes me a ""part time""
American soldier.

Still, for folks with a knack for the obvious, when essaying the
applicability of Third Geneva Convention standards to a particular
prisoner, a uniform (or lack thereof) is a pretty darn good place to
start.

Hey Media, Leave The Kids Alone
By Mike Bayham

In 1964, Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart was asked to define
obscenity.  Justice Stewart then replied, ""I know it when I see it.""
 The same broad guidelines are used to determine what is newsworthy.

Many people during the late nineties began to ask the question of the
true newsworthiness of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.  Because Bill
Clinton's activities were central to a Federal investigation, the
location of the affair and that both participants were in their
political positions by their own choosing the national media felt
justified in relaying to the public the most precise details of the
affair.

When A Promise Is Not A Promise
By Thomas D. Segel

A promise is not a promise when it is given to members of the United
States Armed Forces by their leadership. A promise is not a promise when
the United States Congress can change its pledges into a different
message having no meaning. A promise is not a promise when less is given
than originally guaranteed.

*** Re: The GOP Abandons Its Pro-Life Platform (Bonnie Chernin Rogoff)

Thank you Bonnie Rogoff for speaking out on truths. We all need to raise
the volume, for we are all that is left to be heard. We must re-take the
principals of the Republican Party, and un-merge the right from the
left. Your article is a beginning step in the 'right' direction.
-- Judith Pratt, OK

I have to say that I agree that abortion is wrong, and anyone who does
so is a murderer. However, I believe that President Bush is doing the
best he can, and his ability is a great one. I think he is just waiting
for the right time to pick up the pro-life issue again. He doesn't want
to endanger re-election, and playing nice to the ""moderates"" and
liberals will help him get re-elected, and then he can start really
putting the pro-life message out.
-- Tony Lemaster

Hats off to Bonnie for having the courage to say we should cut off ""W""
for his shameful pandering to the leftist media by shunning the
Republican pro-life platform. In the time since thousands were killed by
the terrorists on 9/11, how many thousands of unborns have been killed
with the passive blessing of the establishment GOP - with Bush and
Ashcroft not lifting a finger to protect them?
-- Don Zimmerman

It's about time that Abortion is removed from the political process.
While I am not an advocate of abortion, I do not believe that it is a
Political concern. Antiabortionists within the Republican Party do not
represent me - and I AM A REPUBLICAN. I demonstrate that with my time,
my talents, my service and my money.
-- Dorothy Danfelser, Elephant Butte, NM

Thank you for the wonderful article about the GOP abandoning the
Pro-Life Platform. I've been very disappointed in the ""straddling the
fence posture"" that President George W. Bush has taken. I do not
doubt his beliefs for the unborn and the value of their life... I do
doubt his wisdom in ignoring and brushing aside the pro-life
conservatives who made his election to the Presidency possible.
-- Cheryl Williams, Edmond, OK

If the Republican Party does not recognize that there are thousands of
us, Pro-Choice Republicans, it will risk losing it's ability to win.
There are too many other issues that need Republican principles that
dividing the party is a disservice to the nation.
-- Rep. Harry Tipton, WY

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This was excellent!! Thank you.
-- Kathi Palmer

Praise God!! I thoroughly enjoyed your column with the above title. You
have hit the proverbial nail on the head. Keep up the good work!
-- Michael Thompson, Republican for Congress

Ms. Seese misses the point with her moral fantasies about sex.  It is
suffering, human death, and other war-related activities that are
immoral, particularly when the victims are women and children.  War is
probably a non-natural activity, since primitive hunter-gatherers did
not engage in warfare with organized armies.  Sex and sexual pleasures
and their pursuit are entirely normal.

The Non-Hollywood Version of Special Operations Forces
By Austin Bay

The inquiring TV talking head wanted me to walk him through a Special
Forces operation. Well, not just any operation. He didn't use the terms
""snatch"" or ""arrest,"" but that's the commando action he clearly had in
mind.

As for the target of this Army Green Beret or Navy SEAL bravado? ""Bin
Laden. My producer wants to know if Special Forces can get him?""

No, the Hollywood script didn't follow, not immediately.

Resolve
A Poem by Bram Floria

On bedrock of the Eastern Shore
Stood gates of our prosperity
Ambition's arms uplifted - One
Outstretched to catch a rising sun
The Apple of our Eye

A lance of flaming fury thrown
A fit of ancient jealousy
To all the Earth thunder resounds
An Eagle's wings were brought to ground
We watched the silent skies

The TV News Addiction
By Linda Chavez

The fine line between being cautious and becoming totally paranoid has
all but disappeared for many Americans. How can we go about our daily
lives, as the president rightly instructs us, when every hour seems to
bring new stories of yet another possible exposure to anthrax or a
government warning that further attacks on the United States or American
interests abroad may be imminent? Worst of all, with 24-hour cable
television, it is possible to spend virtually all our waking hours being
bombarded with ""breaking news,"" much of which later turns out not to be
true, or at least not quite what it seemed at first.

Is watching this stuff hour after hour any different than watching game
shows or soap operas all day long? Sure, we like to tell ourselves it's
more important, more intellectually stimulating, but that's not why we
watch it. Watching non-stop news becomes a hard-to-break habit, or
worse, a neurotic obsession.

Giving War A Chance
By Mike Bayham

The recent outbreaks of anthrax in Florida and New York has heightened
concerns to a new level about American security since the attacks on
September 11th.  Some people see the anthrax attacks as a sign that we
should be wary in engaging the terrorists and the nations that harbor
them.  Peaceniks who protested America's strikes against Taliban targets
have been preaching that nothing good will come out of bombing
Afghanistan.

The President and other departments of the Federal government have
already warned the nation that new attacks against American interests
overseas are likely and that there is the strong possibility that
American blood could be spilled again at home by those who were
connected to the World Trade Center and Pentagon attack.

A Mission Fraught With Peril
By Scott Gillette

The recent and overwhelming chain of events that have changed the world
forever began in the hearts of terrorists, and then moved to flight
schools and nondescript motels in Florida. They climaxed in the wanton
destruction of a major component of the financial capital of the world.
Now this odyssey with an uncertain ending moves to one of the most
forbidding places on the planet.

The contrast between New York City and Afghanistan could not be starker.
Downtown New York was and still is a brash, cosmopolitan celebration of
humankind's achievements and our ability to be our masters of our own
destiny, an Enlightenment idea if there ever was one. Moreover, the
World Trade Center Towers represented the symbol and substance of
commerce and world markets, and the idea that Joseph Schumpeter's
creative destruction will provide a better life for future generations.

www.idespiseamerica.commie
By Bonnie Chernin Rogoff

A madman who thinks he's God creates a monster out of human body parts.
Isn't that what Frankenstein was all about?

This war on terror is beginning to look like a twisted version of the
gothic novel. The evil Doctor Frankenstein attempted to redefine the
creation of life, as we know it. He was trying to create life from
death; a reverse abortion.

In the aftermath of tragic death and destruction, war creates life too.
War protects freedom and allows life to proceed with advantage, but only
if the strategy is allowed to proceed without too much interference. The
peaceniks are trying to intercept our course of action, and can destroy
the three principles of war necessary to sustain the human right to
life.

The following are some of the legislative activities of conservatives in

the travel and tourism industry. The ""Travel America Now"" Act (H.R.
3041) would provide a $500 tax credit per person ($1,000 for a couple
filing jointly) for personal travel expenses for travel within the U.S.

--Rep. Walter Jones (R-NC) introduced a resolution calling for school
children to pray in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

Outside View: Responsibility and Power
By Craig Shirley
Special to United Press International

The ancient Greek admonishment goes, ""never give a child a sword.""
Beyond the obvious, the phrase also meant that one should never grant
power to someone too immature to handle it.

Irresponsible behavior has become the norm rather than the exception in
our culture because it's so easy now to apologize for infractions or
sins or omissions and be forgiven. A quick jet trip to the Betty Ford
Center to be ""rehabbed"" in 12 easy steps and then celebrated and
applauded for being weak or ""just human."" That is, until they trip
themselves up again. Then we are forced to witness the whole sorry
spectacle once more.

*** Re: The Sick Mind of Noam Chomsky: Part II Method and Madness (David
Horowitz)

I wish everyone in America would read this article. Afterwards they
would surely condemn MIT for providing a salary to such an obtuse
anti-American as Noam Chomsky.  If the American people are lucky, Noam
Chomsky will go live in one of the Communist countries he so adores,
then we will never hear from him again.
-- Richard Littiken

Bravo Horowitz! Noam Chomsky has been a left wing ""know it all"" for many
years.  As a young student many years ago, I remember reading his silly
socialist leanings and hearing the professors rave about Chomsky's
analysis.  What is clear is that the world has once again tried to paint
the USA as the evil doers and the international business community as
some kind of demon hell bent on beating up ""little people"".  Horowitz
nails the issues and brightens the day for reasonable truth about U.S.
foreign policy and, most importantly, the context for the policies
during the last century.  As we all know, context drives foreign policy.
-- M. Gene Aldridge, New Mexico

Good writing by David. As my favorite journalist says of the peaceniks
-- ""Get a Life."" David may be helping in keeping the them at bay while
our President gets on with the protection of the Freedom of the world
-- John F. Manning


*** Re: Alan Keyes Columns

Mr. Keyes article is to the point and very motivational as always. I
always have the feeling I'm getting ready to go on the field for the
championship game. He is such a patriot. It's too bad President
Bush can't find some place fore him. He would be an asset.
-- Wayne Kellar, Versailles, Kentucky

We need more writers like Alan Keyes. He is truly an American, an
example for all to follow.

are willing to meet.  I live on the West side of town (290 and Hwy 6).  I
work at Greenspoint (I45 and the North Belt) if you wanted to during the

[IMAGE]  GOPUSA.com Eagle - May 24, 2001 Inside this issue...   What Will Jeffords Do? Republican Study Committee Update Austin Bay... Are Californians Stupid? Linda Chavez... Do You Speak Urdu? Doug Patton... The Emerging Black Conservative Letters from the E-Mail Bag  -- For conservative news, information, and commentary... subscribe  to The Eagle today!   [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]WHAT WILL JEFFORDS DO?   As many of you know, Sen. James Jeffords (R-VT) is scheduled to hold a press conference today to announce whether he will leave the Republican party.  Current talk is that he will, indeed, leave the Republican party and become an Independent, but for organizational purposes in the Senate, he will be a Democrat.   Now, I, like many of you, cannot stand RINOs (Republicans In Name Only).  However, in this case, the name ""Republican"" carries much more significance.  With a 50-50 Senate, the entire leadership structure hangs in the balance.  Imagine, for a moment... Majority Leader Tom Daschle... The thought is just plain scary.   Please contact Sen. Jeffords' office and let him know what you think.  Perhaps a strong wave of feedback in the eleventh hour can make a difference.  His contact information is as follows:   Sen. Jeffords' Washington, DC Office -- 202-224-5141  Sen. Jeffords' Vermont Office -- 803-223-5273  Sen. Jeffords' E-mail Address -- vermont@jeffords.senate.gov   For some of the latest news on the possible Jeffords defection, please check out the GOPUSA.com web site at http://gopusa.com  and also these stories:   Washington Times -- Jeffords delays decision on party switch   CNSNews.com -- Will Lott Hold On As Minority Leader, and Other Questions   Fox News -- Jeffords of Vermont Will Bolt GOP, Dems to Control Senate   NewsMax.com -- Jeffords Says He'll Leave GOP    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]REPUBLICAN STUDY COMMITTEE UPDATE   Conservative Activity in the House   The following are just some of the legislative efforts that RSC Members are making in the House:    -- Rep. Peter Hoekstra (R-MI) will be offering an amendment this week during the debate of H.R. 1, the education reauthorization bill, to strike the additional annual state assessment mandated by H.R. 1 and retain current law regarding testing that was passed in 1994. To read the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/burton/RSC/word/Hoekstra2.PDF    -- Rep. Jim DeMint (R-SC) will also be offering an amendment to H.R. 1 this week to re-insert a ""Straight A's"" provision to allow seven states some flexibility in how they use federal education dollars. To read talking points on the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/burton/RSC/word/DeMint2.doc    -- Rep. Todd Akin (R-MO) will be offering an amendment to H.R. 1 to ensure that state assessments measure ""objective"" knowledge and not subjective feelings and beliefs. To read the ""Dear Colleague"" letter promoting the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/burton/RSC/word/Akin.doc    -- Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Rep. Todd Tiahrt (R-KS) will be offering a parental rights amendment to H.R. 1 that requires parental consent prior to non-emergency, medical, mental health examination, testing, or treatment on students and prior to any student being required to take any survey, analysis, or evaluation that reveals personal information or seeks responses on material inappropriate for children (such as sex behavior, political affiliation, and religious practices). The amendment also ensures that parents have the right to inspect and review instructional materials and surveys. To read the text of the amendment, click here: http://www.house.gov/rules/tiahrt_003.pdf    Read the complete RSC Update at http://gopusa.com/rsc    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]ARE CALIFORNIANS STUPID?  By Austin Bay   Are Californian's Stupid? This Texan's reply is, ""Nope, not at all."" California is home turf for a high-flying slice of America's most economically and aesthetically creative people. I dig Hollywood, admire the Skunk Works and thoroughly respect Silicon Valley.   But apparently California Gov. Gray Davis has a low opinion of his constituents' mental acuity, or at least their historical memory. He seems to think Golden State residents were hatched yesterday, producing a demographic ripe for a political con job replete with fear-inciting sound bites and calculated flim-flam.   In ecology-conscious California, Davis has hired two acid-spewing generators of political pollution and cultural degradation, Clinton hit men Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani. Expect scorched-earth press releases and sulfuric TV squawk show performances reminiscent of the Clinton administration's smoggiest, most dirt-bedeviled moments.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/austinbay    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]DO YOU SPEAK URDU?  By Linda Chavez   How's your Urdu? What about your Tagalog? No idea what I'm talking about? Well, if you do business with the federal government, it's time you took a crash course -- in languages, that is. If you don't, you may be in danger of violating federal civil rights law. That's right. If you run a sandwich shop in a government building, a newspaper stand in a hospital built, in part, with federal funds, or run a construction company that works on federal projects, you'd better employ a bevy of translators.    Why? Because it's the law, thanks to Bill Clinton. And if President Bush doesn't do something about it, we'll all be paying for it -- and not just in dollars.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/lindachavez    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]THE EMERGING BLACK CONSERVATIVE  By Doug Patton   On Tuesday, May 15th, in Omaha, Nebraska, something remarkable happened. A black man named Franklin Thompson was elected to an open seat on the Omaha City Council. What makes this victory so significant is that an overwhelmingly white constituency chose him over an attractive, wealthy, white business owner who spent four times as much money, only to receive two-thirds as many votes.   How can this be? Those who have made a career out of what is loosely called ""civil rights"" tell us constantly that rampant racism in America would preclude such a thing from happening. How can a black man be given such a mandate by an almost all-white constituency?   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/dougpatton    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]LETTERS FROM THE E-MAIL BAG   GOPUSA.com welcomes your opinions and feedback.  We have received numerous e-mails from folks who have commented on columns posted on the web site, news articles, and their general perspectives.    Please continue to share your thoughts and commentary by posting a message on the new GOPUSA.com Forum  or by sending us an e-mail at eagle@gopusa.com    Re: Linda Chavez Column on John Ashcroft Regarding Ms. Chavez article on John Ashcroft's faith: The article quoted one critic as saying: ""He would be charged with upholding and fully enforcing the constitutional rights and liberties of faith groups that he clearly judges to be wrong and in need of correction."" I suppose it would be alright for a heathen to make those judgements?  It is time conservatives (and Christians) take the high ground in these debates.  I am all for Mr. Ashcroft and only wish we could have had people of his caliber in office for the last twelve years.  -- Martin Barker, Pensacola, FL   It is about time that someone, like Ashcroft, took this country back to the basics it was founded on... God. We who still rely on God in our daily living have been forced to ""accept"" homosexuality and every other depraved activity while we are being denied the right to pray in public. If we as a country would really ""In God We Trust"", we would be invincible, indivisible, one country backed by God Himself. I say hats off to someone who will FINALLY take a stand for good instead of evil... Ashcroft, keep your eyes on God and lead us back to where we belong.  -- Rebecca BarkerRe: Foot and Mouth Disease Regarding the column on ""Foot and Mouth"" disease. People have ""feet"", cows, goats, pigs, and other ruminants have ""hooves"". So, the disease gripping England today is ""Hoof and Mouth"" disease, even as British -- and American! -- politicians continually suffer the more dreaded, ""Foot in Mouth"" disease. Keep up the good work! Best regards,  -- Joe Ames Jr.Re: Bush Administration If W. doesn't go farther to the right I will not vote for him again.  His bipartisan, meet me in the middle is not getting it done. Now with this turn coat from Vermont we will lose the Senate. Way ta go...  -- Ben Martin   I am a registered Republican woman and have been very active in the party for 8 years. I am an ex-officer in our local Republican Women and a member of Tulare County Central Committee. I have e-mailed President Bush numerous times to let him know that I and my family are not happy with some of the things he is doing. I know now that the  Republican party is so out of touch with the American citizens. Bush said he wanted to set a new tone in Washington and all I have seen is more of Clinton's policies being put into place. Bush has done some good on the abortion issues . I am ready to resign as he keeps putting homosexuals in office and Clinton's environmental policies in place. Last year my husband lost his job due to the Sequoia National Monument. Enough is enough and we need a man who will stand up for Common sense and not a Clinton Clone. I will no longer support a man who has no backbone.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Charlie,  ENL's Washington Correspondent Peter Cook and I had the chance to speak with newly-confirmed FERC Commissioner Pat Wood on Thursday.  Commissioner Wood discussed what role he would play within the FERC, the issue of price caps in California and the threat by Governor Gray Davis to sue the FERC.       Immediately following the Wood interview, I spoke with former FERC Commissioner Don Santa to get his reaction to the Gov. Davis lawsuit.  If you missed the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, catch both the Wood and Santa interviews in ENL's Video Library.    The House and Senate are still on recess, but our Washington bureau has much to cover on Friday.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports, with the House and Senate coming back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the change of power in the Senate could be decided sometime next week.  Jay says the bureau is scheduled to take a look at some of the comments and reactions from around Washington, and discuss what effect the power shift could have on President Bush's energy plan and the energy debate.  We'll have insight and discussion from our Washington bureau on Friday.     We're also scheduled to bring you segments from Correspondent Stephanie Stanton's trip to Florida.  She attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline, which is a joint venture between Duke Energy and Williams Energy, parent company of ENL.  Catch coverage of Stephanie Stanton's trip on Friday.   Houston bureau Correspondent Kim Benestante reports she's scheduled to bring us details from a settlement reached between the Texas environmental agency TNRCC, and a group of refiners/utilities over reducing air emission in Texas.  Kim also says the bureau is scheduled to discuss the Texas Fresh Air Project.  The nation's largest residential retail provider of pollution-free electricity, Green Mountain Energy Company, is sponsoring the project.  We'll have these and other reports from the Houston bureau on Friday.     Also from Houston, I'm scheduled to speak with incoming Vice Chair of the Society of Petroleum Engineers James Pappas.  He'll be discussing the upcoming Eastern Gulf of Mexico lease sale in the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Don't miss the Pappas interview on Friday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.  Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.  They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.  If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Charlie,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts today while he's on vacation this week.     From Washington on Thursday, the Senate Energy Committee continued its policy to refrain from holding any committee hearings until a reorganization plan is agreed upon.  We'll keep you updated on further developments when the Senate Energy Committee reconvenes.   The House is out of session on Friday, so we'll get reaction to the events that took place this week and discuss what may be on the horizon for the energy debate in the coming weeks.  Also on Friday, we're scheduled to speak with Gas Daily Assistant Editor Nathan Hodge from our DC bureau.  Hodge will discuss the FERC and El Paso trial and a call to holding hearings on the FERC.  Catch Hodge in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to bring us an update on the agreement between Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and the Calpine Corporation on Friday.  The companies are building a pipeline that will run from New Mexico to the San Francisco area.   Also from Houston, we'll have details on Trico Marine Services' acquisition of two  state-of-the-art supply vessels from a Norwegian company.  The ships use a ""dynamic positioning"" system while exploring in deep waters.  We'll have these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Friday.   From the AMEX in New York on Friday, Environmental Brokerage Group's Managing Director of Emissions Trading Michael Intrator is scheduled to join us.  A panel of top American scientists says global warming is a real problem, and it's getting worse.  Intrator will give us his insight on this statement in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Just a reminder:  On Monday, ENL brings you live reports from our new West Coast bureau.  ENL Correspondent Kym McNicholas is preparing for a summer full of energy news from Sacramento.  Log on Monday to catch the first of many reports from ENL's West Coast bureau.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.   Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

Who wouldn't be in favor of a simple solution to the problems that plague much of the African American community in America today -- especially since all of us are affected, not just blacks? Imagine, a one-time payment that would solve family breakdown, poverty and homicide among young, black males. But there are no easy solutions, and the payment of reparations to the descendants of slaves certainly isn't the answer. It's just more of the same liberal cure-all: Let government redistribute money from one group to try to solve the problems of another.   The reparations movement got a big boost this week when one of America's most distinguished newspapers, the Philadelphia Inquirer, endorsed the concept in an editorial. But the real impetus behind the reparations campaign is the grievance industry -- that group of professional guilt-mongers who hope to enrich themselves by claiming to represent the downtrodden.   Read the complete article at http://gopusa.com/lindachavez    [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]A NEW HOPE FOR SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA  By Austin Bay   I plead guilty to harboring hope.   I hope Secretary of State Colin Powell's recent trip to sub-Saharan Africa marks the end of Washington's era of ""symbolic politics"" in the troubled region.   I hope for a new era of ""African realpolitik"" that directs aid to developing the human resources, political mechanisms and local infrastructure necessary to sustain long-term economic growth and social stability.   But awareness of sub-Saharan Africa's complex demography and extensive problems tempers hope with a strong dose of plain old doubt.

Please continue to share your thoughts and commentary by posting a message on the new GOPUSA.com Forum  or by sending us an e-mail at eagle@gopusa.com    Re: Jim Jeffords There is no reason that Republicans in the Senate have to cede committee ratio to the Democrats -- they do not have a ""majority of the whole number of Senators.""  That according to Senate Resolution 8. Sen. Jeffords conversion to Independent does NOT give a majority to the Democrats.  -- Mike Laurance   The departure of Jeffords is something we here in Vermont, that are in the Republican State Party (as I am) knew could happen. It is my personnel belief that Jeffords had to jump ship because we revealed the true intent of the current administration to further the gay agenda here in Vermont. Mr. Jeffords had no other option but to move to the side of the isle that has supported his office for so long. I now know that here in Vermont we will be able to protect our children from the perversion of the homosexual movement. We have started to picket the presence of Out Right Vermont (which is a radical homosexual organization) at youth rallies. We use their own documents to inform community members (both parents and law enforcement) about their objectives and the results have been glorious and to God Be The Glory. Thank you for all you do in facilitating this occurrence.  -- David Ayer   When they write a book about Republican statesmen, leave Jeffords out! That said, Pres. Bush and the VP blew it by not inviting Jeffords to the Teacher of the Year ceremony. They can say all they want to about how many members of congress they would have had to invite, since all states  had a teach, at the ceremony, but the state congressional delegation from the state the Teach or the Year came from should have been invited.  -- Bob Gregory   Fantastic:  Jeffords Leaves Republican Party  -- Mike WagnerRe: Bush Administration I am very concerned over President Bush's education agenda and policy.  Having served in the U.S. Dept. of Education from 1981-1982 as a Sr. Policy Advisor in the Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) and as the author of a best-selling book The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America... A Chronological Paper Trail, I would like to have input into your discussions on education. I think it is important for Americans to support constitutional principles rather than particular persons, and for that reason I am very concerned about President Bush's education agenda.  The U.S. Department of Education is an unconstitutional entity, and if our nation is to retain its freedom (economic and political) it must be abolished!

>Well, this nightmare known as Enron is almost over for me.  I signed on the dotted line today to become a UBS Warburg employee.  Our trading group was sold in entirety to UBS with Enron only receiving royalty payments if/when we make any money.   I will still be in the same location in Houston (new ""Enron"" building)  There will be 500 - 600 of us joining the UBS team.
>The deal is supposed to close in the first half of February at which time I will officially no longer be an Enron employee.  Thank God!
>
>I must say this has been and continues to be the most amazing debacle I've ever seen.  From walking into work through a sea of reporters and cameras, to having scores of friends and coworkers disappear overnight without a contact number or E-mail, to seeing thousands of innocent employees lose their life savings; it has truly been an experience of a lifetime, yet not a good one.  As I've said all along, this is going to be an amazing movie someday.
>
>For what it's worth, working at Enron up until October was a great experience though.  The horrible corporate monster that is now Enron stands in stark contrast to the company I joined a year and a half ago that was made up of thousands of immensely talented, motivated, and genuinely good people.  Among many other lessons, this shows how (in the worst case scenario) a few corrupt people in the wrong places are capable of inflicting unimaginable grief on literally thousands of innocent individuals.  Let's hope it never happens again.  I'd be glad to share my personal experience in more detail to anyone who is interested.

A platoon of crack Special Forces soldiers have taken the first steps of

The heroic force, composed of Texas A&M corps graduates, have broken into
the dog kennel area of the A&M Veterinary Science Building and captured all
the Afghans.
They reported light casualties.

Enron's Political Contributions: Another Bad Investment
By Marc Levin

Recent revelations about Enron's extensive political contributions have
been portrayed as impugning the integrity of the Bush administration and
bolstering the case for campaign finance reform. However, upon closer
scrutiny, it is apparent that Enron's bevy of political contributions
provided the company little political power when it most needed it.

Thus, far from proving the need for campaign finance reform, the Enron
debacle illustrates that political contributions may be one of the worst
investments a business can make. The real lesson from this fiasco may be
that company shareholder representatives and boards of directors should
be more skeptical of the utility of corporate political expenditures.

Democrats on a Partisan Fishing Trip
By Linda Chavez

Sometimes you're damned if you do and damned if you don't --  especially
if there's partisan advantage in it. That seems to be the case with the
recent controversy involving the Enron Corporation and the Bush
administration. It seems Enron executives, hoping for some help, called
folks in the Bush administration last fall when signs of the company's
financial crisis were becoming clearer to insiders. The Bush appointees
listened, checked with their lawyers and did nothing --  which is
exactly what they should have done. Now some Democrats want to turn the
administration's inaction into a federal case.

What Keeps Rumsfeld up at Night?
By Austin Bay

Does a year make a difference?

When the issue is the efficiency, competence and foresight of U.S.
intelligence agencies, one hopes the passage of 365 days is more than a
calendric event.

Of course, Sept. 11, 2001, is the critical mark on that time line. Its
tragic spike moved ""the intelligence issue"" from the theoretical and
obscure to the immediate and focused.

Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again
By Heather Wayman

Well, it's official! Congress has succeeded in telling the military
retirees of this country that their 20+ years of service in defense of
this nation don't mean diddly squat. They have told veterans in no
uncertain terms that it doesn't matter that they gave the best years of
their working lives to defend the freedoms of those in Congress, the
White House and even the folks down on Main Street, Anytown, USA.
Congress had the power to right a wrong directed at only one group of
persons in this country, the military retiree. They failed miserably and
delivered only lip service.

'Black Hawk Down' Brilliantly Depicts The Peril of Entrusting Our
Military to Liberal Statesmen
By Rick Erickson

Do not miss Director Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down.  Like the tribute
in classic Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down is a motion picture
memorial.  Lest we forget, Black Hawk Down reminds us of our
servicepeople's willingness to enter the fray, regardless of the
political, tactical and numerical odds like the ones our soldiers faced
in Mogadishu, Somalia on October 3, 1993.

The movie, based upon Mark Bowden's Nobel worthy chronicle, honors the
dead and wounded soldiers played by actors who rehearsed their military
roles at Special Operations Command, Fort Bragg, North Carolina - the
proving grounds for most of the soldiers who fought and died at the
Battle of Mogadishu.  The movie achieves realism by simulating the fear,
rage and exhilaration experienced by the soldiers themselves.

The Tax Fight: It's Fun Having the White House
By Fred Wszolek

These last few days have been a truly fun time to be a Republican.

Poor Tom Daschle popped off on how he thought the Bush tax cuts were a
mistake, and soon the White House dropped a political ""Daisy Cutter"" on
him. Daschle was forced to come out and explain how he really wasn't
advocating a tax increase, as a dozen Democratic Senators took turns
running away from their own leader.

Go back a couple of years, substitute Newt Gingrich, and it's an odd
kind of deja vu.

*** Re: New Poll shows the Existence of Political Bias on Ivy League
Faculties (GOPUSA News)

Finally, a report has come out that reflects what we have known for a
long time. Even in non Ivy league schools of learning, conservative
views are not allowed.  Students are rebuked and admonished for even
bringing up such things as anti-abortion or conservatively responsible
points of views.  Students are ridiculed in class.

How much time, money and effort was wasted on this? Will the next poll
be ""New Poll shows Existence of Oxygen in Air""?

*** Re: Final Attack on America: The Assault on Her Christian Heritage
and Values (Dorothy Anne Seese)

She is competely on track here. America will not be destroyed from
without, as the events subsequent to Pearl Harbor, the Sputnik launch,
and September 11, 2001 all demonstrate. There is however much more to
fear from those whom Ronald Reagan (correctly) characterized as ""the
blame America First crowd"". These include the public school personnel
who trash America's past leaders and heritage; those who demand that
clearly failed and destructive cultures be used as role models; people
who see no difference between Al Quaeda and the men who led the America
Revolution; many in the media who have been recently ""outed"" as biased
or dishonest by their peers, and several other people right inside this
nation.  They are undermining the core values and fundamental truths
that have served to make America the great nation that it is.

"follow-up","Hi Charlie,

I got your message yesterday.  I'm very sorry to hear about your
grandfather.

Sure, I'd be glad to play tennis sometime.  However, I'd rather practice
golf.  With all the computer work I've been doing, I really started to
miss doing something competitive.  So, rather than tennis, I'm focusing
on a new challenge, and I decided to get good at golf.

I know you'll laugh at all this, but I'm approaching it the same way I
did tennis and baseball.  I'm watching and practicing.  I've been
working at it for about a month.  Unlike a couple of years ago when I
would just go out and play, I'm focusing on learning the stroke and
getting good.  In the past month, I've gone from high 90s to high 80s.
When I consistently get in the mid 80s, I'll get a good set of clubs and
then keep going.  My goal (which I'll reach) is to shoot in the 70s by
December 2002.  If you care to bet, I'll gladly take you up on it. :)

It's so cool, because in the last week, it finally clicked on how the
wrist snap is similar to tennis, and that made all the difference in the
world.  Now, I can practice a good swing instead of a swing that
happened to yield decent results from time to time.

Anyway, it's great to get outside and focus on something competitive
again.  We have some relatives coming in this weekend, so it looks like
we'll be heading up your way on Saturday.  I'm actually going to be
flying to Victoria and back with my brother-in-law's uncle just for fun
on Saturday afternoon.  I think you said that you won't be in town, but
if you are, let me know.

See ya,

Bobby

"Final Benefits Memo","

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be ""Double Deducted"" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Charlie,
	I spoke with Vance Holtzman yesterday about the 3 of us getting together for lunch.  However, Friday does not work because we are meeting up with a large group of interns for lunch on Friday.  Is it possible that we meet for lunch next Tuesday (June 5)?  Please let me know if this fits your schedule...  Thanks,

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Charlie,  On Thursday, ENL's Stephanie Stanton is traveling to Florida to cover the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline.

Bush Update

Weekly Radio Address

THE PRESIDENT: Good morning. Thanksgiving this year comes 72 days after
a terrible national shock, an act of evil that caused, and continues to
cause, so much suffering. Yet, the evil the terrorists intended has
resulted in good they never expected.  And this holiday season,
Americans have much to be thankful for.

We're thankful for the character of our fellow citizens who are flying
flags and donating to charity and comforting those who grieve. Americans
have aided the families of victims, and the starving children of
Afghanistan, half a world away. This country has a good and generous
heart.

We're thankful for the decency of the American people who have stood for
the American tradition of tolerance and religious liberty -- a tradition
that has welcomed and protected generations of immigrants from every
faith and background.

We are thankful for new heroes -- police officers and firefighters and
emergency workers, who have renewed our respect for public service and
provided lasting lessons in courage.

O'Reilly versus Limbaugh?
By Carol Devine-Molin

In recent years, Cable's Fox News Channel has catapulted television
journalist Bill O'Reilly to the top of the ratings heap with ""The
O'Reilly Factor"", his widely lauded current affairs program. O'Reilly
promptly followed that up with a further wave of success as a best
selling author, his latest tome being ""The No Spin Zone"". Now, just this
past week Internet reporter and gadfly Matt Drudge made the claim that
O'Reilly was throwing down the gauntlet to Rush Limbaugh, determined to
challenge the well- established radio star on his own turf.

According to Drudge, O'Reilly's representatives were ""actively pitching
a 2-hour daily radiocast, to air directly opposite RadioKing Rush
Limbaugh"", with a network deal ""said to be imminent"". But, with all on
his career plate, why would O'Reilly seek an incursion into radio now?
That would be a natural query, given the circumstances. Indeed, Drudge
did broach O'Reilly's timing on the matter, noting that ""It is not clear
if O'Reilly views the Limbaugh franchise as weakened and vulnerable
since Limbaugh announced earlier this season that he has lost his
hearing, or if the timing of the O'Reilly move is simply a natural
progression of his media success"". Clearly, before resorting to this
type of explosive speculation, Drudge should have contacted O'Reilly for
clarification and input. A member of O'Reilly's staff would have surely
returned Matt Drudge's phone call.

Applaud Bush for Limiting The Media's Role in The War on Terrorism
By Rick Erickson

General Tecumseh Sherman executed one of the most triumphant campaigns
in military history by ruthlessly trampling his enemy's symbols and by
methodically devastating their will to fight.  If not for Sherman's
relentless warfare and President Lincoln's trust in General Grant's
choice of tacticians, the Civil War's objective was not achievable
because, prior to Sherman's March to The Sea, anything less than
vindictive war failed to carry the day.

Generals fighting our War on Terrorism have Sherman's tactics in mind.
From day one, a relentless strategy proved effective as Al Qaeda symbols
de-materialized and as the formerly defiant Taliban demonstrated zero
will to fight for Usama bin Laden.  Yet, the media is in a frenzy to be
skeptical of the war's vindication and success.

The Best Defense
By Kerri Houston

As the airport security bill heads up Pennsylvania Avenue for a
presidential signature, it appears Congress may have missed the flight.
The focus of the debate should have been solely about security. And not
just security at the airports - but security on the airliners.
Unfortunately, they strayed.

Airborne safety includes reinforced doors, cabin cameras, air marshals
and armed pilots. Although both the Senate and House had already voted
in favor of arming pilots, several conferees including Arizona Sen. John
McCain tried and failed to strip this already approved language out of
the final bill.

It is important that Congress affirmed the right of pilots to carry
firearms before the FAA could follow through with plans for new
regulations to strip pilots of their ability to defend themselves and
their passengers through the prudent use of firearms.

Dealing with Realities: Economy, War, and the Unknown
By Dorothy Anne Seese

The radio is still a great device even in this age of sci-fi.  Tuning
the dial during the night, the wee hours of the morning, can give a
glimpse of the various levels of reality with which Americans are now
trying to cope.  It isn't all that pretty, but it's better to be aware
than asleep at the switch.  As a nation, we spent too long in our
Emerald Kingdom of dreams and fantasies, false assurances by a negligent
government that handed out money like cotton candy, and a stock
market that seemingly defied gravity.

Taken in relatively small doses, talk radio can be a cross-section of
American public thinking, the Jane and Joe Average concerns.

There is, of course, the reality of a Thanksgiving where not all the
family was home for dinner, because some are in unknown places in or
around Central Asia or the Indian Ocean.  That was layered over the
usual Thanksgiving for the homeless where various religious and
charitable organizations fed those who otherwise might have had to
settle for a can of cold beans or at best a baloney sandwich.  It's good
to give thanks for what we have by sharing our time and
substance with those who do not.  It's also very biblical.

Where are the Clerics?
By SARTRE

For more than thirty years, a consistent slide in religious leadership
has taken over the institutional Churches in America. Once upon a time
their mission was preaching the gospel. Today the assignment is to get
and keep tax-exempt status. The holy grail is an IRS 501 (c) (3)
non-profit tax exempt corporation. Incorporation, of any kind, accepts
the rule of the State, over an organization. Why in the world (certainly
not a requirement of heaven) would an assembly of believers consider
themselves a 'trust' of the government?

The unfortunate answer is an acceptance that avoiding paying taxes is
more important than exhortation of the message. Some will say this kind
of filing is but a minor matter and does not diminish from the tasks of
a ministry. They are just being realistic to the organizational methods
of a modern society. Well, all the rationalization that one can muster,
will not change the reality that a church is NOT a corporation.

In a day when many charities have a suspect record, why are so many
'houses of worship' so eager to join the accounting rush to seek
deductions, exemptions and those blessed privileges of a special status.

Expand RICO, Guilt By Association to Cover Terrorists
By Marc Levin

In Vietnam, most historians agree that America fought with one hand tied
behind its back. In the current war against terrorism, we may be doing
the same, but not because of our lack of political will.  Instead, we
are constrained by our commitment to individual liberty and due process.

One illustration of this is our lax criminal law that prevents us from
convicting terrorists based on guilt by association. The U.S. declined
an offer by Sudan to extradite Osama bin Laden in 1996 because it lacked
sufficient evidence to convict him in a U.S. court. While bin Laden had
not committed most of his terrorist acts at that point, we knew that he
was in the process of organizing a vast terrorist network.

RNC Shakeup: Swapping a General for a Colonel
By Mike Bayham

This past weekend the ""leadership"" of the national Republican Party
converged on Austin, Texas to ratify the second RNC head in as many
years.  The vote to elect former Montana Governor Marc Racicot was a
mere formality with President George W. Bush's post-election/debacle
decree that Racicot should be running the RNC going into the mid-term
Congressional races.

It is tradition, and good policy, that the occupant of the White House,
or his advisers, select the chairman of the national party so that the
strategies and messages coming out of both camps are coordinated.
 Because the now immediate past RNC Chairman did not fully understand
this tradition and reality, he is now out of a job.

New Government Report Raises Concerns in Light of Terrorist Threat
GOPUSA News Wire

In a newly released report, the Census Bureau estimated that perhaps
115,000 people from Middle Eastern countries live in the United States
illegally. The estimates are based on the Bureau's preliminary analysis
of the 2000 census. The findings are especially troubling given the role
failures in immigration control played in September 's terrorist
attacks. Not only were at least three of the September 11th hijackers
illegal aliens, a number of past terrorists have also been illegal
aliens from the Middle East, including Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, who tried
to bomb the New York subway system in 1997, and Mohammed Salameh, who
took part in the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993.

Fighting Terror in the Philippines will be Different
By Austin Bay

Defeating Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan has given the United
States tremendous political momentum, which bodes well for upcoming
military and diplomatic operations in The War on Terror.

However, an American public now familiar with ""the Afghan example"" of
warfare should not expect that model to apply too rigorously in the
Philippines.

Don't Believe Everything You Read
By Linda Chavez

The coincidence was almost too good to be true. ""An old news video of
Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
Reagan Administration,"" the e-mail from a friend began, ""what he said
was stunning!"" I remember the event well.

I worked with Ollie North in the Reagan White House from 1985 until
early in 1986, when I was director of public liaison. He was a
charismatic speaker, one I frequently enlisted for briefings on the
situation in Nicaragua, where the United States was trying to help a
group of guerrillas known as the Contras, who were trying to overthrow
the communist Sandinista government there. When Congress cut off funds
to the Contras, Ollie helped set up a clandestine operation to raise
private money for the group. In November 1986, the operation was
discovered, leading to the worst crisis of the Reagan administration and
to criminal indictments against North (whose conviction was later
overturned) and others involved. The Congress also held hearings in
which North and others testified.

It is the 29th anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  Usually an anniversary
symbolizes a happy occasion, such as a wedding or a graduation or the
birth of a son or a daughter.

It is only since 1973, on that ominous day 29 years ago, that America
celebrates the deaths of her sons and daughters.  Nearly 50 million sons
and daughters to be precise.

""We're a great nation. We're a nation of resolve. We're a nation that

*** Re: Dear Mr. President, There are Still Right-Wing Republicans Out
Here (Dorothy Anne Seese)

This is the best article, and I feel much more comfortable to know that
people like Dorothy exist. I think we Republicans should support this
kind of attitudes and urge the president to take it into consideration.
I am proud of her and whish her the best. God Bless America and bless
people like Dorothy. Thank you
-- Lucia Nazarian

Thank you, Dorothy Anne, for writing so clearly what so many of us are
thinking.
-- Darlene Hagen, Plano, TX

I so much appreciate the article by Dorothy Seese. I have been very
frustated with our party on many issues including the ones in the
article. The writer could have also pointed out the sins of the party
regarding recent legislation such as the ""Patriot Act"" or ""Antiterrorism
Bill"". This legislation destroyed the Fourth Amendment and has many
other flaws. Thank you Dorothy for speaking out.

*** Re: Congress Fails Military Retirees... Again (Heather Wayman)

You have done something most of the press absolutely refuses to do...
you  have allowed Heather Wayman to publish her factual  articles in an
up & coming internet periodical which simply shows the betrayal most
veterans are facing from the government they swore to defend.  Again,
thank you for the fairness you have shown.
-- Roy Alba, USAF, Retired

Great, well written article.  I know President Bush will do the right
thing. We need to do all we can for our Veterans.  I'd rather pay them
than non-deserving welfare recipients.
Barbara Edgerton, Houston, TX

HIP HIP HOORAY! To Heather Wayman! You said it and wrote it correctly.
I'm still baffled by Congress. I wish they would've gotten out there and
spent at least 20 years of military service. But they didn't! Why?
'Cause it's tough duty! I just don't understand them, but I do
understand their pay raises which should be going to disabled veterans!
-- Alma R. Farrar, SFC(Ret.) U.S. Army

Sir, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Heather Wayman and
GOPUSA for the article outlining the injustices pertaining to military
retirees and concurrent receipt of VA disability compensation.  SHe did
a wonderful job, and clearly outlined the injustice to all disabled
military retirees. I am a retiree of the U.S. Navy (20 years), and a
disabled Vietnam Veteran. I have been paying for my own VA compensation
for almost 30 years!! I should have been a Congressman!! Thanks again,
Heather!

*** Re: 'Black Hawk Down' Brilliantly Depicts The Peril of Entrusting
Our Military to Liberal Statesmen (Rick Erickson)

The events of Mogadishu, as depicted in Black Hawk Down, brings
compelling clarity to the reality that when our sons, our daughters and
our fathers who serve in the US military are commanded to put their
lives on the line; that they are allowed to quickly and decisively
effect defeat of their opponent without the restrictions imposed by
political considerations. The US military forces are an awesome power
that should only be unleashed when we mean business, never as bluffing
tool. Hoo-ah!
-- Steve Findley, TX

Thanks to Rick Erickson for telling the truth. As a former US Navy
member serving during that time and wanting to be there, most of my
shipmates were outraged at what Clinton and Aspen did. I would hope that
this information would hit the mainstream press, but I am not holding my
breath. I wonder what the public would say if they knew the real facts
about what really happened. I will go and see this movie and know that I
will shed a tear for my brothers. Thanks again Mr. Erickson, shipmate.
-- A. Shon Nixon, Charlotte, NC

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Charlie,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us reports previewing the 115th OPEC Conference from Vienna, Austria.  On Tuesday, the OPEC Conference gets underway with Wolfgang bringing us live reports from the conference throughout the day.  Wolfgang says on Wednesday he's scheduled to have an interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  Don't miss the Rodriguez interview or Wolfgang's live reports from Vienna on Tuesday and Wednesday.   We're going to be busy in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.  For starters, President Bush is scheduled to meet with heads of several national environmental groups at the White House.  We'll bring you an update on their meeting Tuesday.   However, the biggest news from Washington is the change of power taking place in the Senate.  Tuesday evening Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords is expected to officially leave the Republican Party, thereby giving Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 1994.  The change in power is a huge blow to the Republicans' chances of passing the Bush administration's national energy policy.  We'll have more on these developments on Tuesday.     From our Houston bureau, ENL's Gale Smith reports she'll bring us a package on a minority-owned energy business on Tuesday.   The Houston-based company refurbishes pipelines and flow-measurement equipment, and employs mostly minorities.  Correspondent Kim Benestante says the Houston bureau will also bring us a report on the Valero Corporation.  Valero executed lease agreements with purchase options for a 115,000 barrel per day refinery currently owned by El Paso in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The Houston bureau is scheduled to bring us all the details on these stories and more on Tuesday.   Also from our Houston bureau, Omega Oil Company's Andy Ashby is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss below the reservoir production methods, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We'll speak with Ashby in the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.
