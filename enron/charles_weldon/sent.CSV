Subject:	Fort Pierce--Maximum Gas Consumtion for Planning Purposes

Charlie,

The new plant max consumption for planning purposes should be set at 2,490 mmBtu/hr HHV.  In addition to this it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require 335 mmBtur/hr HHV, or a total of 2,825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

The plant consumption is based on the maximum combustion turbine requirement, plus a 5% margin, plus duct burning requirement.  This should be adequate as a conservative maximum case.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Mike Coleman

If I could get bids by year for the first five yrs, then one number for yrs 6 thru 10, that would be great.  I don't know what the vol will be...just assume 5,000 MMBtu/d.

Visit Location:  Houston
Visit Date:  4/30/01




Trait Description	Rating (1 through 4)	Comments                                                                                              	
                              	 	 	
Communication Skills    	         1	Very strong and effective communicator.	
Poise / Confidence    	         1	No problem here.  Suzette is quite confident without being cocky.	
Leadership Potential   	         1	 It is very easy to imagine Suzette in a leadership role.	
Personality / Enthusiasm    	         1	Very energetic and ascited about the possibility of being   a Texas MBA student.	
Maturity    	         2	She should not have any problem mixing with older, more-experienced students.	
Clarity of Professional Focus    	         2	Seems very focused on the potential opportunities following receiving an MBA degree, but is still open-minded. 	


Please provide the Admission Committee with a brief narrative overview of your AdmissionVisit dialogue. You may use this opportunity to elaborate further on the above rankings. 

We had a very comfortable and open exchange of information regarding her work experience and views on current business topics.  She is well-seasoned in dealing with complex business issues and would very likely be ahead of many of her fellow students.  She exudes confidence yet remains open to new ideas and ways of thinking.  I have no reservation in saying that Suzette would flourish at UT and contribute significantly to the overall quality of the class.


Do you believe this candidate is a good match for the culture and strengths of the TEXASMBA program? Please elaborate on any reservations you may have. 

Suzette is definitely a good match for the Texas MBA program.  She is a high energy, very results-oriented individual with a tremendous track record of successful accomplishments.  Her personality is very conducive to working in a diverse team environment and I see no issue that would prevent her from being a top-notch MBA student at UT.

Hi Guys,

I've got a question about shares.  This past weekend, Kathleen and I
began setting up the QuickBooks files for GOPUSA.com.  We've got the
checking set up, as well as accounts receivable and accounts payable.

It's going to take a lot of work to document all the 2001 activities
because of lack of records, but at least from June 1, we will be totally
on the ball.

How do we record shares as far as the balance sheet is concerned?
Recall, that currently, GOPUSA.com, Inc. holds 60,000 shares as treasury
stock.  I hold 32,000, and Bill holds 8,000.  However, yesterday, I sold
1,000 shares to Kathleen's parents at $2/share.  Thus, the company will
now hold 59,000 shares, but $2,000 will be coming in.  How do we account
for this?

Take care,

Bobby

Subject:	Ft. Pierce Gas Capacity Assumptions

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Greetings,

The folks who are getting this e-mail include state editors, some folks
who have been following the web site closely, and recent posters to our
current message board.

I need your help testing out a new section of the GOPUSA.com web site,
and I hope you will participate.

In the past, GOPUSA.com has not made the proper effort that it should in
promoting its message board.  This is unfortunate, and it's about to
change.  If you notice, despite the fact that GOPUSA.com has not
promoted the board at all, it has received a number of posting over the
last several months.

Now, in our effort to really build a GOPUSA community, we are completely
redesigning the message board!  The new message board is called the
GOPUSA.com Forum.  It uses much better software than we had before, and
it is much more versatile:

* Users will actually register and be assigned a password.  This
password will be sent to them so that e-mail addresses can't be bogus.
The users e-mail address, however, does not have to appear on his/her
posts.
* There is a personal message section on the board in which a registered
user can leave a message for another registered user.
* There is an Announcements section where GOPUSA.com can post new news
and information.
* There are varying levels of ""members"" depending on how many posts a
user has made.
* There are icons incorporated on the board for many symbols.
* There is a lot more as well...

So, what we need to do is thoroughly test out the board.  My plan is to
launch it with an announcement in the Monday morning edition of the
Eagle.  So we need to do as much testing as we can this week.  Then,
late Saturday or Sunday, I'll clean out all the test messages, and open
it up to you guys to start posting real messages.

Here's what I'd like you to do:

* Go to the GOPUSA.com Forum at
http://gopusa.com/cgi-bin/ikonboard/ikonboard.pl
* Register with the Forum
* You'll get a password which you can easily change to a different
password in your ""profile""
* Make some posts to the existing topics.  These posts don't have to be
related to the topic.  We're simply testing at this point.  The post
can, however, contain your opinions about the board, etc.
* Please e-mail me if you can participate in the testing.
* Please e-mail me (and post to the board) your ideas on topics.  A
could place for comparison is http://www.freerepublic.com
* Consider the idea on having state specific categories (a California
section, etc.) or just general categories like I have now.  Please give
me your thoughts on this.
* Test out all the features you can on the board.  If you see graphics
that don't ""fit"" with the layout, please let me know.  I'm customizing
the graphics to fit the GOPUSA.com theme, but I haven't changed all of
them yet.
* Don't comment on the fact that the links aren't working on the general
GOPUSA.com page that contains the Forum.  This is just a template of the
new layout, and it will be working Monday.

Thank you so much for your help on this.  Time is of the essence, and I
apologize for the late start on this.  It was not the orignial plan.  We
are going to make a big effort to build a GOPUSA community, and I know
the Forum will play a large role.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Charlie Weldon

"Ft. Pierce Gas Capacity Assumptions","The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our ""bought-down"" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft.

This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460

April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Hey Charlie,

I responded to your cweldon@houston.rr.com <mailto:cweldon@houston.rr.com>
address yesterday and it came back undeliverable...not sure what is up but
anyway...

How's everything going with you and the family? How is Melissa feeling? Mom
said they had a great time visiting with everyone over Easter weekend. I am
sorry we could not be there. How was your Easter? We had probably the best
set of Holy Week services we have ever had.

How is work going? Are you still having to put in quite a few more hours
these days?

My job is going well. I am starting to settle a bit into my new position,
but am still working through some transition issues from my old position. I
think that I will like doing this new job quite a bit. I have good people to
work with. Our church band is really starting to come together...I am really
excited. We are hoping to have a concert on May 19th or June 2nd (depending
on a business trip I may or may not need to take). Mom and Dad are coming up

Subject:	Best way to proceed

Hi Paul,

I had an hour-long conversation yesterday with a guy from Tyler named
Jorge Uresti.  He proposed a very interesting idea, and I'd love to get
your feedback on it.

Jorge has worked on in media, advertising, etc. for political campaigns
since 1994.  He has experience doing radio spots, tv, print (signs,
billboards) for various levels of campaigns.  I think he sees the vast
marketing potential and national position that GOPUSA has to offer and
he wants to be involved.  He threw out the idea of creating a section of
GOPUSA called GOPUSA MediaWorks.  This division would be under the
GOPUSA umbrella and handle all media operations for conservative
business, candidates, and elected officials.  The scope would be web
design, media, advertising, and on and on.

I'm very excited about this because it taps into the whole top-level
vision I have for the company which is to help get the conservative
message out.  Whether we are doing it ourselves (through our news,
information, and commentary) or providing the tools for others to do it,
we can become THE source for conservative activists to get or deliver
their message.

So, assuming this is a good idea (and if it's totally lame, please tell
me), what would be the best way of structuring it?  Simple
sub-contracting?  Creating a separate division?  My instincts tell me
that subcontracting would be easiest right now.  Plus, if the
relationship turned out to be unworkable, then we simply stop doing
business with them.

How would be go about pricing all of this?  What type of percentage
would be fair?  Obviously, we are talking about work that the current
GOPUSA is unable to perform because I don't have the time (for web
design stuff) or the experience (in the media stuff).  On the flip side,
there is no doubt that we could deliver clients these guys that they
would have never landed on their own.  If some folks in their region
might not know them, but they might be familiar with GOPUSA.

Anyway, I'm just passing along some thoughts.  Perhaps Chris might have
some comments as well.

Take care,

Bobby

I spoke to Ed and Steve Treece at the plant this morning. Please confirm that Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record and whom do we send the invoices to. Both Ed and Steve were confused regarding this issue. I also need in writing asap (email ok) from someone within the project deal team that Enron will guarantee the fuel payment on behalf of FPUA. You need to be aware that the plant only has one truck unloading bay. That is fine with a 200,000 gallon tank fill with no rush, but will be unacceptable when you need the 800,000 gallons tank fill or are burning diesel as a primary fuel. What plans are in the works to build another truck unloading bay? When will that bay be operational?

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

"","John,

Attached is the estimated notional bid for the 10-year term gas (9/2001-8/2011) delivered per your proposed project with National Fuel.

The bid as of Tuesday's closing prices comes to $4.63/MMBTU with the following assumptions:

1)  Per Goeff Storey, the basis spread is zero from the mid using the CGPR-Niagara curve.

2)  National Fuel will deliver the gas on the NFG system at Niagara.  The desired point per Storey would be on TCPL/Niagara system on the Canadian side of the border and hence a 5 cent discount has been applied for transport.    It is possible that it could be negotiated with NFG to deliver the gas on the TCPL/Niagara system.

3) Nymex bid is six cents off the mid for a ten year quote of this (small) size.

Let me know if you have any further questions.


Thanks,

Charlie

Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.  Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.  (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).  Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.  These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.  Use tonights close if you don't mind.

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

The NGI daily prices got messed up somehow when I ran the data fetch program.  I updated them in this file now but I figured you would use GDD prices anyway.

Charlie,

Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's.

Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. 

So, we are pretty close on the p&l. I just need to verify your starting positions to confirm/reconcile our true-ups.

Pat

Subject:	follow-up

Hi Charlie,

I got your message yesterday.  I'm very sorry to hear about your
grandfather.

Sure, I'd be glad to play tennis sometime.  However, I'd rather practice
golf.  With all the computer work I've been doing, I really started to
miss doing something competitive.  So, rather than tennis, I'm focusing
on a new challenge, and I decided to get good at golf.

I know you'll laugh at all this, but I'm approaching it the same way I
did tennis and baseball.  I'm watching and practicing.  I've been
working at it for about a month.  Unlike a couple of years ago when I
would just go out and play, I'm focusing on learning the stroke and
getting good.  In the past month, I've gone from high 90s to high 80s.
When I consistently get in the mid 80s, I'll get a good set of clubs and
then keep going.  My goal (which I'll reach) is to shoot in the 70s by
December 2002.  If you care to bet, I'll gladly take you up on it. :)

It's so cool, because in the last week, it finally clicked on how the
wrist snap is similar to tennis, and that made all the difference in the
world.  Now, I can practice a good swing instead of a swing that
happened to yield decent results from time to time.

Anyway, it's great to get outside and focus on something competitive
again.  We have some relatives coming in this weekend, so it looks like
we'll be heading up your way on Saturday.  I'm actually going to be
flying to Victoria and back with my brother-in-law's uncle just for fun
on Saturday afternoon.  I think you said that you won't be in town, but
if you are, let me know.

See ya,

Bobby

Thank you very much for the info.  I have forwarded the specs on to Doug Leach who will be responsible for ordering the fuel oil.  I asked him to identify any spec parameters that are not readily attainable with commercially available #2 Fuel Oil.  For example, I'm fairly certain that 0.0% ash is not normally available.  I have also asked him  to provide information on what grades of fuel oil are available that we should consider.   I will forward any feedback that I receive from Doug to you so we can then have the team determine how best to proceed from that point.

Thanks again for all your help.

The sheet labeled ""Comparison Specs"" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

"Fuel Oil Vanadium Spec","As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the ""spec"" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.  

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000. 

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

"Re: Fuel Specification Requirements","Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled ""Fuel Oil Spec"" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled ""Comparison Specs"" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

Hi Guys,

I've got a question about shares.  This past weekend, Kathleen and I
began setting up the QuickBooks files for GOPUSA.com.  We've got the
checking set up, as well as accounts receivable and accounts payable.

It's going to take a lot of work to document all the 2001 activities
because of lack of records, but at least from June 1, we will be totally
on the ball.

How do we record shares as far as the balance sheet is concerned?
Recall, that currently, GOPUSA.com, Inc. holds 60,000 shares as treasury
stock.  I hold 32,000, and Bill holds 8,000.  However, yesterday, I sold
1,000 shares to Kathleen's parents at $2/share.  Thus, the company will
now hold 59,000 shares, but $2,000 will be coming in.  How do we account
for this?

Take care,

Bobby

Hi Jay,

Please find the attached file. It has two more tabs for the two regressions, one replacing the holes in the data(reg-wo-hole) and one with manipulation in the holes of the data (Regression-w-hole). Both the regressions suggest similar results. The graph shows regression output. We might want to try only the winter data if that is what you are looking for. Or, we may also put the restriction on the regression that the gas consumption cannot go down beyond 5000 (to take care of negative estimates).

Let me know what you think and I would be happy to do the further analyses.

Thanks

HEADLINE: Back  to borders: The attacks of September 11 will increase the

costs of production  and international trade. As a result, the world may

start to turn its back on  globalisation, says Stephen Roach: 

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ROACH  

BODY: 

The footprints of globalisation have left an obvious and  important mark on

the economic landscape during the past decade. But the  terrorist attacks of

September 11 and their aftermath may bring about its  demise. 

In the economic and financial sphere, globalisation is all about  enhanced

cross-border connectivity. Rapidly expanding trade and capital  flows,

increasingly globalised supply chains, and the rapid expansion  of

transnational activity of multinational corporations has made the world  

smaller place. New information technologies have become the glue  of

globalisation, making cross-border connectivity faster, cheaper  and

increasingly frictionless. 

Evidence of globalisation is  unmistakable. According to Morgan Stanley,

global trade rose to a record 26  per cent of world gross domestic product in

2000 - up from 18 per cent in  1990. Transfers between foreign affiliates of

multinationals surged by nearly  twice as much as global trade did over the

past decade. Trade zones such as  Nafta created new linkages between the

industrial world and its offshore  suppliers: exports to the US account for

25 per cent of Mexican GDP, for  example. Asia, excluding Japan, has also

become tightly linked to the US IT  demand cycle; close to 40 per cent of the

region's overall economic growth in  2000 can be accounted for by surging IT

exports to the US. In many ways, the  world was coming together as never

before. 

But the rules of the game  have changed. Terrorism puts sand in the gears of

cross-border connectivity  and the result threatens the increasingly

frictionless world of  globalisation. The tragic events of September 11 have,

in effect, levied a  new tax on such flows. The security of national borders

will now have to be  tightened - hardly a costless endeavour. That will

affect more than airports  and shipping ports. The porous borders of Canada

and Mexico, the conduits of  increasingly seamless Nafta linkages, will be

tightened too. 

As a  result, cross-border transfers will now cost more and take longer,  and

insurance rates on such shipments will become considerably more  expensive.

Moreover, as the recent outbreak of the Nimda computer virus  indicates, it

will no longer be possible to take instantaneous transfer of  information and

financial capital for granted. Terrorist attacks also instil  fear, raising

the risk premia of global connectivity. Suddenly, the brave new  world looks

a lot less seamless. 

Basic economics says that a tax on  cross-border connections should reduce

the flow of such transactions. In  choosing offshore outsourcing versus

domestic production, the calculus of  relative cost advantages may have been

permanently changed. 

But there  is also a psychological dimension: companies could start to look

inwards. The  appetite for forging new cross-border alliances may diminish in

an  increasingly unstable world. Risk aversion may take on  ever-greater

importance. 

There is another important dimension to this  tax on globalisation. It

reflects the impact of a potential shift of national  output away from

productivity-enhancing investments. Productivity enhancement  and

globalisation have always gone hand in hand. The surge of  offshore

outsourcing has been critical to newfound business efficiencies.  

A tax on globalisation could change all of that. It is not only  the

increments to business costs that might now arise from higher  security,

shipping and insurance expenses. It is also the potential  ramifications of a

shift in government spending back towards national  defence, reversing one of

the more important trends of the post-cold war era.  This peace dividend

reduced defence spending as a proportion of US GDP from  more than 7 per cent

to less than 4 per cent during the past 15 years. At the  margin, reversal of

this downtrend could crowd out private sector investment.  

Productivity growth was set to decline over the next five years as  the

excesses were taken out of an IT-induced capital-spending expansion.  The

costs of fighting global terrorism may take an additional toll. A  slowdown

of trend productivity growth would then put concomitant pressure  on

corporate earning power and, by inference, on expected equity  returns.

Investors could be in for a particularly rude awakening. 

New  alliances among governments are likely, juxtaposed against the  private

sector's potentially diminished appetite for globalisation. The  world's

leading powers now seem to be coming together in an extraordinary  fashion in

the aftermath of the attacks. United in the goal of combating  global

terrorism, other grievances, such as trade disputes, are being put  aside -

at least for the moment. 

But these new alliances may backfire  in one important respect. They may

drive an even greater wedge between the  developed and the developing world.

Such a geopolitical wedge could reinforce  long-simmering economic

differences and increasingly isolate the developing  world. Widening income

inequalities between the rich and the poor nations was  an unmistakable

hallmark of the 20th century. According to research by the  International

Monetary Fund, the richest 25 per cent of the world's  population experienced

a six-fold increase in real GDP per capita during the  last century. By

contrast, the lower quartile of world population enjoyed  less than half that

gain. And these disparities are being exacerbated by the  ""digital divide"" of

the information age - the contrast in economic  opportunities between the

computer literate and those lacking such skills.  

These tensions do not speak well of the ""global village"" as an apt image  of

where globalisation is now headed. The economic benefits of  cross-border

connectivity have long stood in sharp contrast with social  disparities

between rich and poor nations. New political alliances that arise  from a

united front among rich nations against global terrorism may well  compound

this gap. 

Such growing fragmentation means that the world  may be turning its back on

globalisation. The recent cancellation of the  annual meetings of the IMF and

World Bank in Washington is particularly  disappointing in this regard. While

both institutions have come under attack  for mismanaging the process from

time to time - especially during the Asian  crisis of 1997-98 - these

meetings offer a forum to probe the strengths and  weakness of globalisation.

That opportunity will be sorely missed at this  critical juncture in history.

This would not be the first setback for  globalisation. The integration of

the Atlantic economy in the 19th century  held out the promise of powerful

convergence within Europe and between Europe  and the US. Yet this seemingly

unstoppable trend gave rise to an equally  powerful backlash, brought about

by the confluence of rising global income  inequalities and political

instability that played a role in sparking the  first world war. 

Yet another wave of globalisation occurred during the  1920s, only to be

brought to an abrupt end by the Great Depression and a  renewed outbreak of

war. The preconditions of these earlier backlashes -  widening global income

disparities and mounting geopolitical tensions - seem  haunting today. Not

only does history tell us there is nothing inherently  stable about

globalisation, but it also highlights globalisation's tendency  to sow the

seeds of its own demise. Sadly, this time may be no different.  

There is always a chance that we are making too much out of the  implications

of September 11. But the global costs of escalating terrorism  are

unmistakable. A new tax on the price of cross-border linkages is a big  deal.

The same can be said of deepening political alliances in one  powerful

segment of the world. 

The forces of globalisation, which  once seemed unstoppable, are facing new

resistance. So too are the  productivity-led underpinnings of the US and

world economy. The playing field  may be tilting before our eyes.

Charlie,

Here is an update on Stagecoach:  Tennessee Gas Pipeline had to re-file their case with the FERC, which will unfortunately delay the deal and push it out of Q2 and into Q3 or Q4.  We were told to update the model (and all pricing) so we know where we stand on our valuation at this point.  Can you please update the gas price for us when you have a chance?  The load factors and the associated volumes are unchanged from the last information that we sent to you. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.

I purchased 202,000 gallons of low sulfur diesel fuel from Central Oil Company (sub of Martin Gas) to be delivered to the Fort Pierce power plant starting on May 29 through June 5. A typical truck delivery is 7500 gallons so there will be about 27 truck deliveries. Deliveries will be made between 7:00am and 5:00pm during week days only. The fuel is priced at $0.9800/gallon delivered to the plant plus any applicable local, state and federal taxes. The fuel will be undyed. The current buyer of record to be shown on the bill of lading truck ticket will be Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority unless told otherwise prior to the first delivery. The truck scheduler at Central Oil is Tim Dick (813/448-2105) and he will coordinate with Steve Treece at Ft. Pierce. I have communicated all of the information above to Steve. Upon completion of the tank fill I recommend FPUA take a fuel sample and test for all appropriate diesel fuel quality specifications.

I searched all my data and could not find where you might have given me monthly PG&E city gate prices.  At your convenience could you send these along to me along with monthly Nymex going back a couple of years.  I looked at what you had sent Kim and it looks like a PG&E WACOG calculation.

Thanks.

Phil

Charlie,

Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's.

Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. 

So, we are pretty close on the p&l. I just need to verify your starting positions to confirm/reconcile our true-ups.

Pat

Subject:	Ft Pierce


A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   Trucks need pumps.
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3""?     3""
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    Standard or 3 inch disconnects

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  Always someone at plant. Can take delivery 24/7.
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  Need 200K gallons to replace previously burned oil only.
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   Dyed
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   Coastal was previous supplier
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   FPUA is buyer of record
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  
9) Commercial start date of plan     Tank to be ready on 5/15/2001
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Yesterday I faxed a copy of Colonial Pipeline's specifications for fungible low sulfur diesel fuel (74 grade) to Mark Breese. That spec sheet is indicative of the specs for low sulfur diesel in Florida. It must be remembered that Florida has no refineries nor product pipelines and receives their fuel via barges and vessels from domestic and international refineries and terminals. Will forward Colonial jet fuel (54 grade) specs.

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

The sheet labeled ""Comparison Specs"" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

"EOL Live Pricing Link to Excel","Team,

We now have the capability of importing live EOL quotes into our models if so desired.  Colin Tonks, who supports IT development efforts for the trading floor, has made this capability available to us via a file that I have now saved in the Models directory under the name ""EOL_Product_Listen"".

In order to run the file, you will first need to run a program called ""Tibco Rendezvous Client""  You can run this program by going to the Start Menu/System Utility Applications/Installation and Disk Creation/""Install Tibco Rendezvous Client"".  You will have to reboot after installation is complete.  After rebooting you can then open the program ""EOL Program Listen"".

The program has 2 sheets: 1) EOL, and 2) EOL_Search

Sheet 1 (EOL) is the sheet that pulls in the live quotes based on an EOL ID number that you enter in column C. In order to determine the correct EOL ID number, you need to use Sheet 2 (EOL_Search).  On this sheet, you can enter a search string in cell B1 and then hit the search macro.  Efficient use of this search macro requires some trial and error since the search is limited to a max number.  Once you find your product ID #, you can enter it into Sheet 1 (EOL) and then hit the ""Start"" button.  You will then be pulling in live quotes which can be linked to any model which you wish.

A word of caution:  We will likely all find limitations into how this tool can be effectively used.  For instance, it has been brought to my attention that the product ID #'s change each month as new prompt months roll on.  Thus, the tool should be used with discretion and verification that the right ID # is linking up should always be verified, especially on older files.  Nonetheless, as we get comfortable with the tool, I believe that it will provide some value on deals that require real-time pricing inputs.

Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  I can provide a quick demo at my desk if anyone wishes.


Thanks,

Charlie

"Re: Fuel Oil Sample","Our ""spec"" is <.05 ppm.  I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.  We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.  I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.  The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.

Thanks,

Charlie

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.


Charlie

Dear Intern Buddy - 

Thank you for volunteering to assist the Analyst/Associate Program with candidate cultivation this summer.   Summer internships are very important to the overall success of our program and we need your help to insure that our interns have enjoyable and meaningful experiences this summer. 

We have assigned you to be Michael Finger's summer buddy.   

To kick off the summer, the A/A Program will be hosting a ""Meet the Pool"" party on Thursday June 7th at the Hyatt Regency from 5:00PM to 9:00 PM.

We would like for you to use this opportunity to meet your summer buddy and to introduce them to others in the pool.  Please make contact with your buddy as soon as possible to make plans to attend the party together. 

In addition to attending this party together, we would like for you to spend a little time each week with your buddy.    We will send out an email next week with some suggested things for you and your buddy to do together.  Whether it is lunch or a simple phone call, your continued interaction with these interns could make a difference in the intern's decision to join Enron fulltime.  Suggestions from you are always welcomed!

As we progress through the summer, please make an attempt to gain insight into your buddy's internship.  Any feedback from them regarding their summer experiences will be welcomed, positive or negative.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at x35275.

Thanks again for your help.

Sincerely, 

Ted Bland

Charlie,

Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's.

Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. 

So, we are pretty close on the p&l. I just need to verify your starting positions to confirm/reconcile our true-ups.

Greetings Editors and Board Members,

Just wanted to pass along a few items and wish you a good weekend.

First, for state editors... remember that you do not need to send me an
e-mail this weekend or any future weekend with you Monday morning
headline.  If I get an e-mail from your updater page on either Saturday
or Sunday, I'll then check your section on Sunday evening and use your
first headline for the State News Briefs section of the Eagle.  If you
want me to use a headline other than the first one, please send me an
e-mail.  Again, I'll include a headline if it is done on Saturday or
(even better) Sunday.  I won't use a Friday headline because I'd like
the news to be fresh.

Board members... please work on bios and pictures.  I'd like two
versions of the bio.  One is a one paragraph version which will be
contained on a web page of all directors, and the second is the full
bio.  I hate to say this, but there is really no rush on this. :)  I'd
just like to get it done.  Immediately following the board meeting at
the end of the month, the Eagle will run a store announcing the board of
directors and corporate officers, so that's the real deadline.

Finally... for all on this e-mail... on Monday, we will begin running
our first ad.  It is for CNSNews.com.  PLEASE CLICK ON IT.  They and
GOPUSA.com will be monitoring click-throughs, and I want to make sure we
deliver good results.  A few clicks per day would be cool.  They will be
running the ad for the entire month of June.

Take care, and please let me know if you have any questions.

Bobby

HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 

Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.

Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my
nephew.  Love, Margaret

I just wanted to confirm that you received my resume OK.  I just noticed that I  replied to your EGM message you sent out yesterday instead of your ENA Trading Track message that I received Friday.  I just wanted to make sure that you didn't accidentally overlook it due to the wrong subject header.


Thanks,

"Ash Spec Response from MHI","Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Charlie,

Here is an update on Stagecoach:  Tennessee Gas Pipeline had to re-file their case with the FERC, which will unfortunately delay the deal and push it out of Q2 and into Q3 or Q4.  We were told to update the model (and all pricing) so we know where we stand on our valuation at this point.  Can you please update the gas price for us when you have a chance?  The load factors and the associated volumes are unchanged from the last information that we sent to you. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need more information.  

Thanks,

John

Subject:	Ft. Pierce Evaluation

Jennifer, attached is a summary model of the Ft. Pierce evaluation using Enron's curves.  Please note that there are two scenarios provided, based on a best case and worst case pipeline demand charge scenario.  The spread option model was dispatched based on the same assumptions as utilized by the gas group in developing their pipeline cost assumptions.  I've tried to add notes to the models outlining potential areas of additional value as there are some unique characteristics of this deal that should provide additional value to the project.  I'll be over to help review the cash flow model.  

Thanks for everyone's help (Edith/Charlie)

- Jim

I got my offer from UBS Friday and turned it in today, signed.  The judge approved the deal Friday also so if nothing gets screwed up in the next few weeks then I should have a new employer (when the deal closes)

Have fun,
