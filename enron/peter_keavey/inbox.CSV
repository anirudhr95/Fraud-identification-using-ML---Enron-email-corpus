Face-off on McDonald's

Is the world's number-one fast-food chain really poised for a comeback --
or is the stock depressed for good reason.

By Michael Sivy

MONEY editor-at-large Ken Kurson and Michael Sivy go head-to-head over this
column's recommendation of McDonald's (see Supersize this Stock!
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/010514.html ]).
On Monday, Sivy argued that the stock is a good buy even though it appears
beset with problems -- the economic slowdown in the U.S.; fears about
mad-cow disease and hoof-and-mouth disease that have depressed beef
consumption in Europe; and the chronically weak euro, which reduces the
value of McDonald's European profits. Sivy believes that these problems
will soon pass, profit growth will pick up again, and the stock's valuation
-- well below historical levels -- will climb back toward normal. Kurson
doesn't buy it. Their debate follows:

Kurson
This time you've gone too far! How can you possibly like anything about
McDonald's -- either the business OR the stock? (I'm assuming you at LEAST
detest the food.) Yes, the valuations are cheap next to its own historical
averages, but NOT against competitors. The PEG ratio is by far highest in
the group: McDonald's PEG is 1.39 versus 1.01 for Brinker [EAT], 0.99 for
CBRL Group [CBRL], 1.06 for Darden [DRI] and a lowly 0.95 for Tricon [YUM]
(despite those endless delicious stuffed crust innovations at Pizza Hut).
And McDonald's price/sales ratio is more than TWICE any of its competitors.

And for what? A proven ability in the PAST to build faster and a net profit
margin that's the envy of the sector. But as your column points out,
overseas is where the opportunity is and also where the problems are. You
say the problems will pass, but I totally disagree. Mad-cow disease and
hoof-and-mouth disease MAY be temporary, faddish, fashionable concerns. I
happen to think they're not so easily dismissed, but even conceding that
point, it doesn't get at the root of MCD's failure to replicate overseas
the disgusting (and disgustingly profitable) empire it has erected here.
Evidence? Japan, where MCD is planning a piddling 220 new stores in 2001
(versus 360 in 2000). That's the company's second biggest market (bigger
than Europe) and there are concerns about profit margins there, as well.

You rightly point out the company relied too heavily on promotional
gimmicks. But then you give MCD points for totally ridiculous stuff like
high-end coffee at their McCafes. Yeah, right. I'm sure Starbucks is
quaking in its boots. Just like Pizza Hut was terrified by McPizza.

Sivy
The short response to the points you raise is that I don't really believe
in securities analysis.

Here's the longer version: I don't believe that projections of a company's
business trends are more reliable than the stock's actual track record and
natural statistical tendencies, such as regression to the mean. If analysts
couldn't anticipate the effect of telecom infrastructure overbuilding on
Cisco's business, they can't anticipate anything.

Fact is, McDonald's has proved remarkably resilient over time, despite its
mediocre products. The same arguments you make now have been made before.
And yet McDonald's has retained its dominant position relative to Tricon
and Wendy's and other smaller chains.

When globalization was a hot concept right after the Berlin Wall fell,
companies with global franchises enjoyed excellent growth. Now ""globaloney""
is out of fashion and no one is willing to pay up for such franchises (that
goes for U.S. packaged food companies too).

At the moment, everything is going against McDonald's stock. But most of
the these trends are cyclical, in one way or another. The U.S. economy will
turn. And the McDonald's marketing machine will improve its success rate.
And sooner or later, the stock's multiple will improve. I'm not looking for
the next Dell Computer, but I do think that from this price the return on
McDonald's will beat a 12 percent hurdle rate.

As to the current backlash against beef, I regard it as a temporary -- and
rather ridiculous -- expression of deviant psychology. Basically, the same
sorts of people who supported North Vietnam in the '60s have redirected
their self-hatred from the national to the personal level. This leads to
body-piercing, food phobias, and incompetent riots at international
free-trade meetings. This too shall pass -- or at least be redirected again
to rescuing mink, or something.

Kurson
I, too, place no faith in securities *analysts*, and thus share your
suspicion about growth-rate projections. But I certainly believe in
securities *analysis*, and you do, too, because that's what it is to
recommend MCD based upon its history, the cyclical nature of the economy,
the foolhardiness of those who oppose beef. These all fit comfortably under
the heading of traditional analysis, and I don't see any percentage in
throwing out all the tools just because a couple of them display the greasy
fingerprints of sell-side analysts.

As for your point about past record being more compelling, yeah, I give a
company credit for a track record. But only when there's a forward-looking
justification for why that success (and higher valuation) will continue. I
mean, if a stock costs more than the stock of its peers because the company
is doing things differently and is hard to imitate, I'm willing to afford
it some juice. But if a stock costs more simply because it always has, I'm
skeptical. Especially when things have changed to make previous advantages
less impressive -- as I believe has happened to McDonald's. That's why I
cited the sharp fall-off of store openings in Japan.

Any drop in beef consumption may very well be temporary: There's clearly no
limit to how fat Americans are willing to become and like a lot of trends,
we're way out in front and I expect the rest of the world to follow suit in
time. However, I DON'T think McDonald's will continue to show the dominance
in fulfilling that demand, or at least continue to do so way better than
competitors.

Sivy
Where I differ with you is that I have a far greater skepticism toward all
trend projections, even though I acknowledge that we have to use them to
value stocks.

Just as economists have predicted 19 of the past seven recessions,
securities analysts tend to over-predict changes in earnings trends. What
really changes, though, is the level of valuations. A decade ago, everyone
loved companies with global brand names. Now they ignore those stocks. I
tend to think that the fashion has changed far more than the underlying
fundamentals. Statistically, it's most successful to bet on companies with
strong track records when they're off their game and valuations are low --
that's true even if you can't predict where their next success will come from.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

\----------------------------------------------------------/

1. Main Course: In New York, It's Cheese-Cart Gridlock
======================================================

The cheese-centric restaurant Artisanal is only the latest,
and most over the top, example of New York's sudden mania
for anything aged and moldy.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09CHEE.html?0509wd

-----

Critic's Notebook: Funky, Runny, Ripe? Waiter, Bring It On

No cheese is too obscure for Times critic William Grimes
(see his review of Le Cirque, below), who counts himself
among a swelling population of cheese snobs.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09NOTE.html?0509wd

-----

Paan: To Refresh a Palate, or a Sultan's Kiss

The experience of eating paan, a tantalizing mix of Indian
flavors and textures, is as seductive as a stolen kiss, as
relaxing as an after-dinner cigar.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09PAAN.html?0509wd


2. Recipe of the Week: Mexican-Flavored Chicken Thighs
======================================================

Chicken thighs have a huge advantage over lean breasts. They
are juicy and flavorful, and made even more so by Mark
Bittman's Mexican-inspired treatment, a quick liquid rub for
the thighs, which packs plenty of punch, even if you use
just a little cayenne.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09MINI.html?0509wd

-----

Tagines: A Secret Kept Under a Terra Cotta Lid

If you can get your hands on a tagine, the Moroccan pot with
a hoop skirt of a lid, try one of these luscious dishes,
including one for striped bass and another for chicken with
olives and preserved lemons.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09TAGI.html?0509wd


3. Wine List: The Day California Shook the World
================================================

Frank J. Prial remembers the 1976 wine tasting in Paris that
American winemakers and cultural historians have come to
characterize as the defining moment in the evolution of fine
wine in this country.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09WINE.html?0509wd

-----

Tastings: Protean South African Blend

Judging strictly by flavor and price, says Eric Asimov,
South African pinotages are among the best red wine values
out there.

Wine picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Washington State is becoming known for its red-hot reds --
from cabernets to merlots. Check these out:

1998 Gordon Brothers Cabernet Sauvignon
$22 - Juicy, jammy fruit, spice, chocolate and a meaty
component are well framed by firm tannins -- this is one for
the cellar.
Four stars
http://www.winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=20239&SUBMIT.x=28&SUBMIT.y=9

1998 Seven Hills Seven Hills Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon
$28 - Ripe and concentrated yet supple. Interesting for its
spice components that back up rich, deep, dark, fruit
flavors of black cherry, blackberry and black currant.
Four stars
http://www.winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=19737&SUBMIT.x=28&SUBMIT.y=9

1999 Andrew Will Klipsun Merlot
$40 - For those who like wild and daring flavors in their
merlots.
Four stars
http://www.winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=20095&SUBMIT.x=28&SUBMIT.y=9


4. Multimedia: Cooking With the Times -- The Mayo Clinic
========================================================

Learn classical French technique through recipes and video
instruction. This month's class: The Mayo Clinic. Despite
what you might think, homemade mayonnaise is a true sauce, a
culinary treasure.
http://www.nytimes.com/cooking?0509wd


5. NYC Restaurants: A Glittery Circus With Many Rings
=====================================================

Behold Le Cirque 2000, a giddy swirl of wealth and
privilege, of gilt without guilt, a glittering social
pageant that cries out for a Balzac or a Wharton. As pure
spectacle, there is nothing in New York like it. (Three
stars.)
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/09/living/09REST.html?0509wd

Take a Video Tour of Le Cirque
http://www.nytimes.com/library/dining/050901lecirque-video.ram?0509wd

To Go: Pizza's Turkish Twin

The real specialties at Sultan II in the Flatiron District
are the fresh-baked breads, savory pies and lahmacuns, or
Turkish pizzas.

The spot formerly known as Mother may not be chic (or well
ventilated), but it's not a bad spot for some low-key

6. Readers' Opinions: Menu Suggestions for a New Mom
====================================================

From simple recipes for a new mother to what wines might be
best for your health, readers share their insights and
answer fellow readers' questions.

Q. I have never been much of a cook, but things have been
pretty pitiful since my baby arrived 5 months ago. I have
very limited time for food preparation, and the stew-type
standbys aren't as appetizing as it gets warmer. I am going
for healthy, balanced meals that don't require too much
hands-on prep time. -- sozobe

"Organization Announcement","Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

1. Main Course: For Oysters, the Raw and the Cooked
===================================================

The iced-and-shucked variety of oysters will always have its
fans, but cooked oysters aren't just for the apprehensive
eater.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/living/25OYST.html?0425wd

Pork Belly: Living Low on the Hog

Is it a meaty fat or a fatty meat? Either way, the tempting
pork belly shows true genius when it's cooked.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/25/living/25BELL.html?0425wd


2. Recipe of the Week: Spinach, Oyster and Chorizo Stew
=======================================================

This rich, multifaceted stew is one example of what cooked
oysters can add to a dish.

tea with an accent of salt.

3. Wine List: Chardonnay Finds Its Inner Finesse
================================================

Chardonnay is not only America's favorite white wine, it's
also become the whipping boy for wine lovers who see it as a
garish emblem of much that is wrong with wine today. But
quietly, some California wine producers have developed a
crisper, more lively Chardonnay, using an older style of
winemaking.

5. NYC Restaurants: A Find, Once Found
======================================

Virot's namesake chef, Didier Virot, is inventive, with an

ordinary meal. (Two stars.)

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

The favorite phone

Despite all the problems in the telecom industry, Verizon looks like it's
in terrific shape.

By Michael Sivy

If you were looking for an industry to be the poster child of the tech
wreck, you'd have to pick telecom. All three of the major long-distance
telephone firms -- AT&T, WorldCom and Sprint -- are having to face up to
business strategies that have failed. And suppliers of the industry's
infrastructure -- from Corning to Lucent and Nortel Networks -- have seen
short-term demand for their products collapse. But amid all the wreckage, a
few of the local phone companies are in surprisingly good shape. And none
has more to cheer about than Verizon [VZ].

As industry deregulation opened the door to more competition, everyone
expected that long-distance and high-tech would thrive while local service
withered. But just the opposite has happened. Offering long-distance
service is easy: All a company needs is one junction point in each market
it wants to serve. But to compete in local, it needs connections to each
subscriber's house. AT&T tried to get around that by using wireless
technology and cable TV lines to deliver local service.

But getting around established local service has been much harder to pull
off than anyone expected. Local phone companies may indeed face competition
on the home front in three to five years. But in the meantime, they're
enjoying the best of both worlds -- a near-monopoly on their core business,
combined with excellent expansion opportunities in other areas. And no
company is playing both sides better than Verizon.

Verizon's core market is arguably the most valuable in North America -- the
Northeastern United States from Maine to Virginia. Moreover, the company,
which was formed by a merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE in June 2000,
has land lines to more than 30 states. Currently, Verizon is permitted to
offer long-distance service in New York State and Massachusetts and will
expand to other states as regulators permit.

Even more impressive, the company has very strong positions in two of the
fastest-growing telecom businesses -- wireless phones and digital
subscriber lines (DSL) that are used for Internet access. Verizon is No. 1
in wireless, providing service almost everywhere in the U.S. and enjoying
more than a quarter of the total market share. The company's DSL business
is expanding faster than scheduled, passing 500,000 subscribers at the end
of last year and on track to top its 1.2 million target at the end of this
year.

Of course, the company is feeling a bit of a pinch because of the current
economic slowdown. But the merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE provided
the usual post-merger cost-cutting opportunities that give Verizon some
room to compensate for minor business shortfalls. Cost savings could reach
$800 million in 2001 and approach $2 billion in 2002.

For some reason, investors don't seem to be registering all these
strengths. The share price is exactly where it was when I last recommended
the stock in January, even though the company's outlook continues to
improve. Over the next five years, Verizon could offer as much as 12
percent compound annual earnings growth along with a 2.8 percent dividend
yield. That's clearly the makings of above-average total return -- and yet
the shares now trade at 17.5 times earnings. Local phone service may not
sound glamorous, but those are tough numbers to beat.

Unrecognized power plays

These five electric utilities are undervalued and under-appreciated by
analysts. But they offer superior long-term returns.

By Michael Sivy

Given the recent turmoil in the stock market and uncertainty about the
economy's prospects for the rest of the year, many investors have been
diversifying their portfolios with income investments. In March, for
instance, shareholders pulled a record amount of money out of equity mutual
funds -- the last time stock funds saw comparable outflows was in the
aftermath of the 1987 crash. Much of the money has gone into income
investments, and especially bond funds.

Funds that invest in Treasury bonds and other high-quality long-term issues
are especially popular. Personally, though, I think there are better
alternatives that offer higher yields, more flexibility and long-term
growth potential. Preferred shares, for instance, can offer yields of more
than 7 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for Treasuries. (For more
information on these unique investments, see ""Preferred shares: uncommon
values"").
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001020.html ]
And they generally sell in round lots costing only about $2,500, versus at
least $10,000 for most bonds.

My top income choices, however, are utility stocks, and for one very simple
reason: rising dividends. When you buy a bond or a preferred stock, you
lock in a certain level of return. And since there is always some
inflation, the real purchasing power of your income erodes over time. But
most electric utilities offer long-term dividend growth. Even though
utilities' earnings increases don't look like much compared with the growth
rates of tech stocks, even 5 percent or 6 percent a year will keep you
ahead of inflation -- and eventually outpace the return on bonds (see
""Selecting stocks for income,"").
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001016.html ]

One of my top utility picks over the past year has been Duke Energy [DUK],
an electric company based in the Carolinas. In addition to having a
well-run local business, Duke has profited enormously because one of its
subsidiaries provides power to the California market where electricity
prices are soaring. As a result, the stock has gained 50 percent since I
first recommended it last summer. I still think Duke has attractive
long-term prospects, but obviously it's not as good a buy as it was a year ago.

Where are today's best values in the electric utility sector? For the
answer, I turned to the Leuthold Group, a value-oriented investment
advisory firm in Minneapolis that regularly does a quantitative screen for
stocks that are undervalued because they are out of favor. Of the 53 stocks
the most recent screen identified, 10 are electric utilities. Of those,
I've winnowed out five that have solid finances and offer projected
earnings growth of 5 percent or more over the next five years. In addition,
these electric companies have modest P/Es, based on this year's estimated
results.

The five include DTE Energy [DTE] at $43.40 a share. The parent company for
Detroit Edison is in the process of acquiring MCN Energy, a Michigan gas
company, which could boost the combined firms' long-term earnings growth.
In the meantime, DTE pays a 4.8 percent yield and trades at a 12.2 P/E.
FirstEnergy [FE], the holding company for Ohio Edison, is in the middle of
a complicated attempt to acquire GPU, and uncertainty about the deal has
depressed the stock. Whether it goes through or not, at $29.40 a share,
FirstEnergy offers a 5.1 percent yield and a 10.4 P/E.

OGE [OGE] Energy is the holding company for Oklahoma Gas & Electric. At
$22.10, the stock offers a 6 percent yield and a 12.5 P/E. Pinnacle West
Capital [PNW], parent of Arizona Public Service is expanding its generating
capacity in the Southwest. At $49.50 a share, this growth-oriented utility
pays a 3 percent yield and trades at a 13 P/E. Finally, Potomac Electric
[POM] supplies power to Washington D.C. and the surrounding area. The
company is acquiring the Delaware utility Connectiv, in a move that should
enhance long-term returns. At $22.40 a share, Potomac Electric carries a
4.4 percent yield and a 12 P/E and should grow as long as Washington keeps
expanding.

Subject:	Sitara EOL Bridge Problem Today

The problem we faced today was due to 2 eol deal packets (2098073, 2099764) not having startdate and enddate.  Missing these 2 tibco message fields caused the bridge to bounce and resulted in the queue to build up while the bridge is starting up. (The bridge takes 2 minute for startup).  Each time these deals are sent/resent, it continuously cause the Sitarar EOLBridge to restart, thus magnifying the buildup of the queue.

The corrective action we are taking at our end is to build a rejection logic when eol packets do not have start and/or enddate.

Enron Global LNG
Enron Global LNG is positioning itself to be a creator and leader of a global wholesale LNG market.  The rising prices of natural gas in the United States and concerns over future energy supplies have created a bullish outlook for LNG in the U.S. and around the globe.   LNG has played a major role in serving energy needs in many parts of the world, but its place in the U.S. energy picture has been limited. An LNG market that spans the globe can supply vast amounts of otherwise stranded gas to the world's growing appetite for cleaner burning fuels.   Enron Global LNG sees great opportunity for Enron's wholesale energy business model to help shape yet another energy market.


IN THE NEWS

Enron Corp. Says First-Quarter Profit Rose 20 Percent 
Houston, April 17 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the largest energy trader, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent as sales almost quadrupled. Profit from operations rose to $406 million, or 47 cents, from $338 million, or 40 cents, in the year-earlier period.  Enron raised its 2001 profit forecast to $1.75 to $1.80 a share, from its January projection of $1.70 to $1.75.

First-quarter revenue surged to $50.1 billion from $13.1 billion as Enron boosted the volume of power sold in North America by 90 percent. Enron had a first-quarter gain of $19 million, or 2 cents a share, for an accounting change, making net income $425 million, or 49 cents a share. There were no charges or gains in the year-earlier period.

In need of a new image

Bristol-Myers is evolving from a consumer-products company to a drug giant.
But investors still haven't caught on.

By Michael Sivy

When you've been plodding along your whole life, it's hard to change your
image -- that's the challenge Bristol-Myers Squibb [BMY] now faces. Most
investors still regard the company as a slow-growth consumer-products
business defined by brand names such as Clairol and Excedrin. But they're
missing something important. Over the past few years, Bristol-Myers has
been repositioning itself as one of the nation's largest pharmaceutical
firms. And when investors catch on, the stock could receive a valuation at
least 30 percent above current levels.

I last recommended Bristol-Myers in September at $53.50 a share. The stock
has always received lower valuations than Pfizer and Merck because it gets
less than three-quarters of its sales from pharmaceuticals. But
Bristol-Myers had been transforming itself, and for a while, it looked as
if it was getting more respect. By January, the share price had risen
nearly 40 percent to top $74. But since then, the shares have given back
almost all their gains. One reason is that the company is posting flat
earnings growth this year. Moreover, several of the company's top-selling
drugs, such as Glucophage for diabetes, are facing competition from
generics, which will force lower prices and eat into market share. Even so,
the long-term outlook for the stock has actually improved.

On May 21, the company announced that it would sell Clairol to Procter &
Gamble for $4.95 billion. That sale will reduce the percentage of
Bristol-Myers' business that comes from consumer products. Even more
important, when the deal closes, Bristol-Myers will have $6 billion in cash
-- four times its total debt outstanding. That cash hoard can be used to
make acquisitions. Pharmaceutical giants are like movie studios -- they're
basically immense distribution systems looking for product. All
Bristol-Myers has to do is revamp its product pipeline with the acquisition
of boutique drug companies or biotech firms, and the stock will suddenly
look a whole lot flashier.

Since it won't be hard for Bristol-Myers to complete its transformation
into a drug powerhouse, without even hurting its balance sheet, you'd think
that investors would be giving the stock more of a premium. At $56.25,
Bristol-Myers trades at 24 times this year's estimated earnings. That's
certainly a fair valuation for a stock with a 12 percent core growth rate
and a 2 percent dividend yield. But if you look not at what Bristol-Myers
has been, but what it so easily could become, you'd think a substantially
higher P/E should be in order.

"The Insider from Travelocity.com","Please respond to feedbackRomance in Paradise!
Dear Peter,
Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more 
developed resort. For others, it's not about the outdoors at all--if 
you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City"" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us. Destination Guides Reservations engine

What We're Reading[IMAGE]  Pearl Harbor: The Day of Infamy - An Illustrated History 
by Dan Van Der Vat
 President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously declared December 7, 1941 as ""A day that will live in infamy,"" the day the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, pulling the U.S. into World War II. This visually stunning book, by noted historian Dan van der Vat, features groundbreaking research, over 250 images, including previously unpublished personal photos from the perspective of both Americans on the ground and Japanese in the air, as well as a moment-by-moment breakdown of the attack. There are also numerous personal accounts, memorabilia, and illustrations by Tom Freeman. A major achievement. 
  Our Price: $31.96  You Save: $7.99  (20%)     [IMAGE]  An Album of Memories: Personal Histories from the Greatest Generation 
by Tom Brokaw
 As he's done in his immensely popular Greatest Generation volumes, Tom Brokaw again celebrates the trials and triumphs of the Americans who experienced the Depression and World War II. Album of Memories is a collection of letters written to Brokaw by those who lived during this period, and in some cases, their children. Complete with photographs and memorabilia, the overall emotional impact of these letters is intense. To read them is both a moving experience and an opportunity to experience history at its most intimate.

by Dan Kurzman
 Just after 5 a.m. on April 18, 1906, an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale ripped through sleeping San Francisco, toppling buildings, exploding gas mains, and trapping thousands of citizens beneath tons of stone, broken wood, and twisted metal. Drawing on meticulously researched and eye-witness accounts, Dan Kurzman re-creates one of the most horrific events of the 20th century. More riveting than fiction but incredibly true, Disaster! is unforgettable history--a masterful account of the calamitous demise and astonishing resurrection of an American city. --From the publisher

Standard Time was one of the crowning achievements of Victorian progressiveness and one of the few Victorian innovations to have survived practically unchanged into our era. Few technological inventions have proven to be both as invisible and as important. In Time Lord, Clark Blaise introduces us to an almost-forgotten figure, who saw the world as a whole and overcame traditional and national objections to the rational accounting of time. --From the publisher
  Our Price: $19.20  You Save: $4.80  (20%)     [IMAGE]  April 1865 : The Month That Saved America 
by Jay Winik
 April 1865 is one of those rare, shining books that takes a new look at an old subject and changes the way we think about it. Jay Winik shows that there was nothing inevitable about the end of the Civil War, from the fall of Richmond to the surrender at Appomattox to the murder of Lincoln. Readers will come away with a new appreciation for that momentous month and a sharpened understanding of why and how the Civil War was fought. This is a magnificent work--surely the best book on the Civil War to be published in some time.

Subject:	FW: Cactus Project


Self explanatory.

A class of elementary students started a class project to make a planter to
take home & wanted to have a plant in it that was easy to take care of, so
it was decided to use cactus plants. The students were given greenware
pottery of a clown planter & they painted them with glaze & had them
professionally fired at a class outing so they could see the process. It was
great fun. They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters & they
grew nicely but unfortunately were not allowed to take them home.
The cactus plants were removed & a small ivy replaced them & the children
were then allowed to take them home.
The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time..

"Sivy on Stocks: Why aren't banks doing better?","SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
June 6, 2001

Why aren't banks doing better?

Interest rate trends couldn't be more favorable, but leading banks such as
J.P. Morgan and Bank One can't get any traction.

By Michael Sivy

If I were asked to name the single most important stock market indicator,
I'd say the tilt of the yield curve. When long-term interest rates are at
least half a percentage point higher than short-term rates, the economy
typically grows at a healthy rate. But when short-term rates are even with
or higher than long-term rates, the economy almost always stagnates or
starts contracting. The yield curve is especially important for banks,
since they have to borrow short-term money that they lend to long-term
borrowers. The difference between short- and long-term rates, therefore, is
a rough gauge of banks' profit margins.

After five cuts in short-term interest rates this year by the Federal
Reserve, the difference between short and long rates is two full percentage
points. With loan margins that fat, you'd think that the top U.S. bank
stocks would be in great shape. But they aren't. Shares of leading banks
such as J.P. Morgan Chase [JPM] and Bank One [ONE] are flat to down so far
this year. And both stocks have announced that their earnings for the
current quarter will be below what analysts were expecting. What's the
explanation for the lousy results?

Essentially, there are two problems. Many of the big banks lent
aggressively during the boom of the past five years and now find themselves
saddled with lots of problem loans. In the case of J.P. Morgan Chase, those
loans are to tech firms, such as telecoms. Bank One's problem loans, by
contrast, represent credit-card debt. But in both cases, the banks will
have to clean up their portfolios before they can truly profit from the
improved interest-rate environment.

Global giants, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, have a second set of problems.
Over the past five years, their earnings became increasingly dependent on
investment banking activity, such as IPO underwriting, private equity
investments and proprietary trading. All of those businesses are depressed
and will likely remain so until the tenor of the market improves
substantially. And even though the Nasdaq is up 35 percent from the April
lows, J.P. Morgan's losses on past investments are still outpacing its
gains on those that are recovering.

Where does that leave the stocks? Basically, they have a lot of sewage to
wade through for the rest of this year. But they should be coming back
strongly by the start of 2002. And, of course, share prices normally
anticipate such improvements by at least a few months.

I recommended J.P. Morgan Chase in January at $53 a share, saying the bank
faced a rough six months, followed by accelerating growth over the coming
three years. That scenario is unfolding more slowly than I expected, and
the share price has declined by six bucks. But for long-term investors, I
continue to believe that this is the must-own bank stock. However long it
takes to clean everything up, the bank will be a powerhouse a couple of
years from now. And after slipping back since January, the share price
seems absurdly cheap. The bank's earnings power is well over $4 a share, a
rate it should reach sometime next year. At the current $47 share price,
that's a price/earnings multiple of less than 12 for a stock with a 12
percent compound growth rate and a 2.8 percent dividend yield.

I'm less enthusiastic about Bank One. Consumer indebtedness has doubled
since 1992. So I can't help but wonder how quickly the bank's problem loans
will be taken care of. It's true that consumers will be getting some tax
relief and that recent mortgage refinancings have boosted disposable
income. But we all know that most of that money is going to be spent
instead of going to reduce household debt. As a result, I think Bank One
will be working through problem loans for a while -- and it's a more
expensive stock than many other bank issues.

"Sivy on Stocks: The rebound begins","Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
April 18, 2001

The rebound begins

Greenspan's aggressive rate cutting will fuel a market comeback that should
boost stock prices 20 percent or more over the next 12 months.

By Michael Sivy

For nine months, the economy has been slowing. And most growth stocks have
been dragged down by a brutal decline in tech shares. Through it all,
investors complained that the Federal Reserve was keeping interest rates
too high. Well, there's nothing left to complain about. Fed chairman Alan
Greenspan's surprise half-point cut on Wednesday brings interest rates down
to where they should be. And make no mistake about it -- the economy will
begin picking up speed, and the stock market will be substantially higher a
year from now.

Greenspan has been widely criticized for keeping rates high for so long. He
began raising them in early 1999 and continued to keep rates up through the
end of last year. High rates made sense in the first half of 2000, when the
GDP was growing at an annual rate around 5 percent, fast enough to rekindle
inflation. But it was a mistake for Greenspan to continue keeping money
tight after growth slackened to 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Moreover,
even once he began cutting rates in January, he brought them down too slowly.

I believe that Greenspan held up rates for so long because he knows how
tough it is to fight inflation. For political reasons, it's often hard to
increase interest rates. So when the Fed has a chance to give inflation an
extra push down simply by keeping rates up a bit too long, that's the
politically savvy choice. Greenspan even has a term for that ploy -- he
calls it ""opportunistic disinflation.""

Such a policy was perfectly feasible as long as the economy was expanding
slightly -- and thereby narrowly escaping recession. But capital spending
continued to weaken and mounting stock market losses threatened to undercut
consumer spending. Then when the March employment numbers were announced on
April 6, they showed the first drop in a long time. With employment
weakening -- and unemployment rising -- Greenspan could no longer afford to
keep his foot on the brake. And so, two weeks later he cut rates, laying
the groundwork for a substantial rebound.

I'm not minimizing the risks that still exist. The economy will most likely
be weak for another quarter. And plenty of individual stocks will suffer in
May and June as companies warn of disappointing second-quarter results.
There are also lots of industry-specific problems to worry about. Banks
face rising losses on bad tech loans, telecommuniciations companies could
suffer from overcapacity for at least another 18 months and various tech
firms are still trying to work off excess inventories.

In fact, the current market rally could burn out in a week or two. But I
believe the market has already seen its lows. And if those lows are
re-tested between May and July, I doubt the indexes will go much below
where they've already been.

More important, the prices of big, strong, well-established growth stocks
figure to be substantially higher a year from now. Historically, after the
Fed has cut rates four times in a row, blue chips gain more than 20 percent
over the following year. I think we're looking at those kinds of gains
again. Tech stocks will rally, but so will other glamour growth stocks,
including entertainment shares and top retailers.

I've already mentioned in this column that I jumped the gun by loading up
on tech indexes in January and February, and then running up 15 percent to
20 percent losses in March as the sector suffered its final drop. Well,
after today I'm almost even, so I plan on buying myself a really good
brandy after dinner this evening. And whatever the ups and downs of the
next few months, I expect to be feeling even better come next April.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

""To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling."" --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release issued regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties. Otherwise the settlement is confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or otherwise.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

"Capital Book","To further the process of reaching the stated objectives of increasing Enron America's Velocity of Capital and associated Return on Invested Capital, we have decided to create a Capital Book. The Capital Book will have no profit target associated with it and will be managed by Joe Deffner. The purpose of creating this book is to ensure that all transactions within Enron Americas, with any form of capital requirement, are structured correctly and are allocated the appropriate cost of capital charge. 

The previous numbers used in the Business Plans at the beginning of this year will remain for all transactions in place and where we hold assets. Therefore, on any assets currently held within each business area, the capital charge will remain at 15%. Internal ownership of these assets will be maintained by the originating Business Unit subject to the Internal Ownership Policy outlined below.

The cost of capital associated with all transactions in Enron Americas will be set by Joe. This process is separate and apart from the current RAC process for transactions which will continue unchanged.

Capital investments on balance sheet will continue to accrue a capital charge at the previously established rate of 15%. Transactions which are structured off credit will receive a pure market pass through of the actually incurred cost of capital as opposed to the previous 15% across the board charge. Transactions which are structured off balance sheet, but on credit will be priced based upon the financial impact on Enron America's overall credit capacity.

On transactions that deploy capital through the trading books, the Capital Book will take a finance reserve on each transaction, similar to the way the Credit Group takes a credit reserve. This finance reserve will be used specifically to fund the capital required for the transaction. As noted above, the Capital Book will have no budget and will essentially charge out to the origination and trading groups at actual cost.

By sending market-based capital pricing signals internally, Enron America's sources of capital and liquidity should be better optimized across the organization. 

Questions regarding the Capital Book can be addressed to:
Joe Deffner		853-7117
Alan Quaintance	345-7731

Stock strategies for the energy mess

High oil prices and electricity shortages may put pressure on economic
growth. Here's what you can do to protect your portfolio from the power
crunch -- and maybe even profit from it.

By Michael Sivy

Anyone who has been reading this column over the past few months knows why
I think the recent market upswing is the start of a major recovery in stock
prices. But there is one fly in the ointment -- energy prices have been
soaring at a rate not seen since the 1970s. Since January 1999, in fact,
oil prices have more than tripled, while the cost of natural gas has more
than doubled. In addition, California -- and other West Coast states, to a
lesser extent -- have been suffering from electricity shortages that have
pushed up power prices.

Memories of the mid-1970s oil crisis -- along with double-digit inflation
and a crushing recession -- are still fresh in many investors' memories.
But today, the real threat isn't inflation -- it's the drag on economic growth.

Demand for energy is relatively inelastic. In everyday terms, that means
that people buy roughly the same amount of gasoline and use roughly the
same amount of heating oil no matter how prices change in the short run.
When prices are high, therefore, the extra costs simply come out of money
consumers would have spent on something else. That creates a drag that some
economists call an ""energy tax."" Fortunately, the negative effect on
overall growth is fairly small -- maybe a quarter of a percentage point a
year -- and the stimulative effect of lower interest rates and the tax cut
will more than overcome that.

Individual sectors and specific stocks may be a lot more directly exposed
to high energy costs, however. So assess each of your holdings to make sure
its profits won't be hurt significantly by fluctuations in energy prices.
Instead, look for companies, such as Johnson & Johnson [JNJ], that have
impressive track records of consistent earnings gains and dividend increases.

Of course, there will also be a chance to cash in on the renewed boom in
oil and gas exploration. Just remember that many such stocks already
reflect those opportunities. Vice President Cheney's old firm Halliburton
[HAL] will be a prime beneficiary of the Administration's energy plan. But
Halliburton shares -- up 50 percent since April -- look expensive at 36
times this year's earnings.

Surprisingly, there are still a fair number of value plays in the oil
sector. Domestic integrated oil companies, such as Amerada Hess [AHC] and
Phillips Petroleum [P], trade at P/Es below 10 and will continue to profit
enormously as long as oil and gas prices remain fairly high. Unocal [UCL],
at an 11 P/E, is also attractive and is rumored to be a takeover target.
Those may not be the most exciting stocks, but they'll surely help to
balance any stock portfolio that is betting heavily on a resumption of
economic growth.

Special situations

These tips for identifying investment opportunities will help you find
stocks that can move up even when the stock market is flat on its back.

By Michael Sivy

As long-time readers of this column know, I like to focus mainly on the
biggest, most financially healthy companies. Such blue-chip growth stocks
are well-followed by Wall Street analysts and by the media, so their
prospects are generally reflected in the share price. Occasionally,
however, those stocks get undervalued -- but they generally return to fair
valuations within a few years. If you buy them when they're down, odds are
you'll at least match -- and probably slightly outpace -- the general
market over a decade or longer. (For a list of the stocks I think are most
worth tracking, see the Sivy 100.)
[ http://www.money.com/sivy100/ ]

There are, however, smart ways to enhance that basic strategy. Some
investors, for example, search for so-called ""special situations,"" stocks
that will rise or fall based on unique events, like a takeover bid or a
corporate restructuring. Anticipating such events takes some savvy, but
there are guideposts that can help. One excellent source for those tips is
The Superstock Investor, a new book by Charles LaLoggia and Cherrie Mahon,
published by McGraw Hill.

I've known Charlie for more than a decade and he's spotted a lot of great
opportunities, particularly among midcap and smaller stocks that aren't
well followed by analysts. In fact, I featured one of his recommendations
in Sivy on Stocks last November 8 -- United Industrial [UIC], a small
defense-related company with little debt. Since then, the stock has risen
40 percent to $16 a share.

Since every special situation is different, the best way to learn about
them is to read through a lot of case studies -- and Charlie's book is full
of them. But he also lists a number of signs to watch for that can help you
identify a stock poised for big gains. The most important thing to remember
is that a special situation needs a catalyst that can unlock its value.
Here are 10 potential triggers:

* An outside investor files a 13-D form with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, revealing that it has accumulated more than 5 percent of a
company's stock.

* A company with one outsider that owns more than 5 percent of the stock
attracts other investors who buy big stakes.

* An outside owner announces that it is seeking ways to enhance shareholder
value or expresses an interest in selling its stake.

* A dispute about the best way to get the stock price up breaks out between
a company's management and a major outside shareholder.

* A company with one or more large outside owners announces a stock buyback
program, giving more influence to the biggest shareholders who will push to
get the stock price up.

* A company in a consolidating industry sells or spins off non-core assets,
thereby turning itself into a pure play that is likely to be even more
attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry announces a restructuring charge
that causes its share price to decline substantially, making the stock
highly attractive to potential acquirers.

* A company in a consolidating industry is partially owned by a brokerage
or buyout firm that could devise a strategy to boost the value of its stake.

* The founder of a company who owns more than 10 percent of the stock
passes away, removing potential opposition to an acquisition.

* A company that owns a stake in another company is itself acquired,
leading the acquirer to try to raise cash by selling the stake and putting
the company in play.

None of these factors by itself is a reason to invest in a company. But if
the stock is attractive on fundamental grounds, the chance that it will
turn out to be a special situation provides an enormous kicker.

Higher Flyer

Top techs such as Nokia may not look cheap by traditional valuation
measures. But they may still be good buys.

By Michael Sivy

Value is a relative term. Every once in a while, you get a chance to buy
shares in a company with annual earnings growth of more than 20 percent at
a price/earnings ratio of 16 or less. But that doesn't happen very often.
Most of the time, conservative investors are lucky to find 14 percent
growth at a 16 P/E. Slightly more aggressive investors might be happy with
18 percent growers at P/Es in the low 20s. The most successful growth
stocks, however, may never fall all the way down to those cheap valuations.
But that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy them.

In fact, there are good reasons to devote at least a part of your portfolio
to those kinds of high flyers. For one thing, those companies are typically
among the world's most successful. In addition, they receive ongoing
support and sponsorship from Wall Street analysts. As long as they continue
to meet expectations, they will hold up fairly well in temporary market
downturns. And they will be among the first stocks to bounce back.

A perfect case in point looks to be Nokia [NOK]. The Finnish giant is the
most successful firm in one of the world's most rapidly growing industries.
And since 1997, Nokia's share of the global wireless-phone handset market
has risen from less than 20 percent to 35 percent, helping the company
nearly double earnings per share since 1998.

Of course, no company can increase its market share indefinitely, but there
are several factors that should help sustain Nokia's superior profit
growth. Since most everyone who would use a cell phone already has one, the
bulk of the sales of cell phones using existing technology is replacement
business. And when existing users switch phones, they tend to maintain
brand loyalty -- if they change providers at all, they migrate toward the
strongest one (say from Ericsson to Nokia, but not the other way around).
As a result, Nokia could gain another couple of market share points in
current-technology handsets.

Even more important, the company is capable of attaining a market share
topping 40 percent in the next generation of handsets -- both those that
use more sophisticated technology for voice transmission and those that
will provide paging, instant messaging, and Internet access. Overall, the
handset market is projected to grow at an annual compound rate of just
under 23 percent over the next four years. And with market share gains,
Nokia's sales should do even better.

In the past few quarters, the over-capacity problems that have plagued the
telecom industry have been hurting handset makers as well as service
providers. Not only has growth slowed -- total sales of cell phones were up
only 12 percent in the first quarter -- but the introduction of new
technology is being delayed. As a result, Nokia's earnings, up just 15
percent in the first quarter, will likely fall short of a 20 percent gain
for the year as a whole.

Once the current slump passes, however, Nokia's growth should recover to
nearly 25 percent a year. And so, despite a P/E of 40 based on estimated
earnings for the current year, the stock seems quite attractive. At $33,
Nokia is trading at just over half the level it was a year ago. And the
share price, which dipped as low as $21 a month ago, now appears to be in
an upswing. Even if the next couple of quarters show subpar results, Nokia
figures to be back among the market's brightest stars within 12 months.

Bigger is better

Tech stocks are coming back, and giants that dominate important markets are
likely to lead the advance. At the forefront of that group is Microsoft, as
the company's latest earnings report shows.

By Michael Sivy

""It may be that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the
strong -- but that is the way to bet,"" said Damon Runyon, whose short
stories about the hustlers of New York City's theater district served as
the basis for the musical ""Guys and Dolls."" Runyon's street-smart
observation is good advice for today's stock market. It may be that almost
all computer and telecommunications stocks were hurt in the Tech Wreck of
the past year. But not all of them will rebound equally as the economy
improves. Some dot-coms are gone for good. And many small tech stocks have
permanently lost market share. But the biggest tech companies, which
dominate important industry sectors, are likely to lead a powerful advance.

The next six months will be tough for technology companies, with excess
inventories and infrastructure overcapacity afflicting industries such as
semiconductors and telecom. But the longer term outlook argues powerfully
for a rebound. Over most of the past century, stocks have gained
substantially -- as much as 65 percent -- in the 18 months following four
straight interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. And as soon as
investors are convinced that the worst is past and that the outlook for the
next few years will be increasingly positive, they'll begin moving money
into the most solid tech choices.

That's essentially what has been happening with Microsoft [MSFT]. The share
price dropped to less than $41 in December. But since the Fed began cutting
rates in January, the stock has climbed a whopping 70 percent to nearly $69
a share. And on Thursday, Microsoft's rebound was reinforced by a
surprisingly good first-quarter report. It wasn't that earnings were so
high -- they were only a couple of cents a share above expectations. But
both analysts and investors were impressed by how well Microsoft's
businesses are holding up.

In the first quarter, Microsoft's revenues climbed 14 percent from
year-earlier levels. Sales were particularly solid for upgrades of the
Windows operating systems used by corporations and for server software. And
though the company indicated that earnings growth for the next couple of
quarters would be flattish, the revenue outlook remains quite positive. For
next fiscal year, which begins in July, earnings are projected to improve
by a bit less than 10 percent.

That near-term growth alone can justify Microsoft's 35 P/E, based projected
earnings for next year. But investors aren't looking at current profits.
They want to know whether the franchise is strong -- and whether it's
getting stronger. The answer to both questions is yes. And since Microsoft
is a massive cash generator -- with $30 billion in liquid assets -- it
shouldn't ever have to worry about financial problems.

Microsoft provides such a broad range of software products that it can
thrive even if sales of personal computers remain low. Further, the
company's large established base of users means that upgrades can boost
revenues even when sales of new software products are unimpressive. Most
important of all, by the end of the year Microsoft will have upgraded most
of its important products. That means that the world's software giant
figures to be at the forefront of the next market advance once the current
bear market is clearly over and the economy is in an upswing again.

Building boom

Prospects for a strong economy next year are boosting the share prices of
companies like Caterpillar and Fluor.

By Michael Sivy

The stock market has been listless since mid-May, marked by low trading
volume and weak share prices. But although the financial media seem to be
focusing almost entirely on daily earnings warnings and weak trading volume
trends, the accumulating evidence points to an excellent 2002. Most
Fedwatchers think that chairman Alan Greenspan will cut interest rates at
least one more time this summer -- probably at the June 26-27 meeting.
Since rate cuts need six to nine months to take effect and the first cut
occurred in January, the economy should be picking up by October at the
latest -- and should continue to gather momentum through the early part of
next year.

The consensus forecast for 2002 is that the economy will grow more than 3
percent, that unemployment will hold steady below 5 percent, and that oil
prices will come down slightly. That, in turn, should lead to a small
decline in inflation. Accelerating growth combined with falling inflation
is the magic formula for a rising stock market. And though neither trend
figures to be strong, they both are definitely going in the right
direction. Not surprisingly, such an economy is great news for cyclicals,
such as construction-related businesses.

One stock I like is Caterpillar [CAT], the world's largest maker of
earthmoving equipment, especially big-ticket machines that can weigh more
than 50 tons and sell for $500,000. I first recommended the shares in
August at $39, or about 11 times this year's estimated earnings. Since
then, the shares have appreciated 43 percent to $55.80. Despite that run,
shares trade at just 16.4 times next year's estimated results, and are
still 10 percent below their all-time high, set in 1999.

One reason the stock's price/earnings ratio remains moderate is that
profits are expected to rise more than 30 percent next year, as the economy
rebounds. Such growth isn't sustainable, but longer term, earnings should
be able to rise at a compound annual rate of 11 percent. Include the 2.4
percent yield, and the stock's total return potential still looks quite
attractive.

A slightly riskier, but potentially lucrative choice is Fluor [FLR], a
leading construction and engineering firm that is just coming out of a
major restructuring. Fluor manages enormous projects, such as building oil
refineries and electricity-generating plants. Given U.S. energy needs over
the next five years, as well as likely demand for other big construction
projects as the economy rebounds, Fluor should be set to enjoy good times.

The stock is up a little over 12 percent since I recommend it in April. At
a current $57.40 a share, the stock trades at 23.4 times next year's
estimated earnings. Profits are expected to rise more than 23 percent next
year, and earnings could rise at a 12.5 percent compound rate over the next
five years. Moreover, once a coherent U.S. energy policy is in place --
presumably before the end of the year -- investor attention will likely
shift even more to a company that boosts the nation's capacity to keep
gasoline and electrons flowing.

"(01-150) Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule","
Notice # 01-150
May 4, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Amendments to NYMEX End of Week Post-Close Trading Session Rule

DATE:
May 4, 2001
===========================================================

Please be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of
changes to the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule that were
recently approved by the Board will become effective.

Specifically, beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001 and continuing for
subsequent Friday post-close sessions (and post-close sessions the day
before a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in
effect:

(1)  Contract months eligible for trading in these sessions will be
expanded from the first four to the first 12 consecutive listed contract
months.

(2)  The sessions will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.57(""POST-CLOSE TRADING SESSION"") AND
NYMEX RULE 6.57A (""END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 6.57A.     END OF WEEK TRADING SESSION

On the last trading day of the calendar week, and, in any week when an
Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close
trading session provided on the trading floor pursuant to Rule 6.57.
Instead, on such dates, an end of week trading session (the ""End of Week
Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week
Session shall commence twenty (20) minutes after the close of trading in
all futures contracts and shall continue for a period of [ten (10)]  * five
 (5) * minutes in all energy and metals futures contracts, subject to the
following conditions:

(A) Trading during the End of Week Session shall be limited to the first
[four] * twelve * listed delivery months;

(B) Trades occurring during the End of Week Session for a particular
contract month of a futures contract shall be executed openly and
competitively at a price within the daily trading range of the applicable
contract month for that futures contract * and as further expanded above
the daily high and below the daily low only for the contracts listed below
provided however that no such expanded trading range may exceed the price
fluctuation limits in effect for the applicable contract as of the end of
the RTH session:

Contract                 Additional Ticks

Crude Oil                20 ticks
Natural Gas                   50 ticks
Unleaded Gasoline             50 ticks
Heating Oil                   50 ticks *

(C) During the End of Week Session, Floor Members, Floor Brokers and their
customers may participate in the same manner as trading occurring during
the regular RTH session, except that any order submitted during the RTH
session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have
expired as of the end of RTH for purposes of this End of Week Session.
Accordingly, in the event that a market participant with such an expired
order seeks to participate in the End of Week Session, a new order must be
submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week
Session shall not be considered in determining any settlement price; and

(F) Floor Members executing trades during the End of Week Session shall
mark a line across their trading cards prior to the entry of an End of Week
Session trade.

\---------------------------------------------/


1. Main Course: In Cookbooks, a Passport Home, Wherever
That May Be
===================================================

A number of new cookbooks, filled with recipes that seem
at once familiar and new, give you all you need to satisfy
a yearning to feed others. Amanda Hesser discusses some of
the best, and includes selected recipes.

On Menus Everywhere, a Big Slice of Patriotism

The entire city has been swept away by a tide of patriotic
sentiment, writes William Grimes, and those engaged with
food are no exception.
http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/24/dining/24NOTE.html?rd=hcmcp?p=041IN0041IMH44iiz012000mN97rN9Rx


2. Recipe of the Week: Combining Fire and Rice, and a Few
Choice Flavors
===================================================

Pilaf is far easier to make than risotto, it is equally
delicious, and it is capable of producing scores of spin-
offs. Mark Bittman provides recipes for basic pilaf, plus
a set of wonderful variations.

Gelee: So Chic, So French, So Slippery

This recipe for crab salad with Apple gelee mixes Jell-O's
very sophisticated Gallic sister with the tanginess of
apples and the softness of crab.

3. Wine List: Trivial Pursuit That Goes to Your Head
===================================================

The Shafer Line on Wine newsletter, from Shafer Vineyards
in the Napa Valley, offers no harvest reports, no tales of
the winery cat, not even a single obvious plug for Shafer
wines. And that, says Frank J. Prial, is a good thing.

Wine picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

The adage ""what's old is new again"" certainly holds true
for wine as grape varieties synonymous with Old World
wines are thriving in the New World. Pinot noir, the grape
responsible for red Burgundy, is causing a buzz in New
Zealand; syrah, a star in France's Northern Rhone region,
is rising to new heights in Chile; and barbera, a staple
of Italy's Piedmont region, has found a home in
California's Gold Country.

1999 Lynskeys Wairau Peaks, Pinot Noir
Marlborough, New Zealand
$33 -- Can the promise of pinot noir be realized in New
Zealand? The quality has been unpredictable over the past
few years, but this bottling shows the potential of the
grape in cool-climate Marlborough. The ripe, black cherry
fruit is reminiscent of an Oregon pinot, the velvety
texture is almost Californian in nature, and it sports
just enough earthiness to think of Burgundy. All these
elements, however, blend seamlessly in this unique wine.

1999 Caliterra, ""Arboleda"" Syrah
Colchagua Valley, Chile
$20 -- Syrah from the Northern Rhone region of France is
known for its rustic, intense nature while syrah from
Chile is just beginning to develop its own personality. If
you like Rhone wines, Caliterra's new label, Arboleda, is
one to seek out. It's powerful and rather opulent with a
telltale smoky, blackberry character, but also has zesty
acidity, which wakes up the palate.

1999 Boeger Winery, Barbera
El Dorado, California
$15-- Barbera from Italy's Piedmont region is juicy, fresh
and rather tart. In this version Boeger has managed to
capture the quality of the grape variety while injecting a
little California sunshine. Think plump raspberries and
bing cherries with a dash of licorice.


4. NYC Restaurants: A Supercool Setting, but a Warm
Welcome
===================================================

Somewhere along the line, Man Ray decided that a
restaurant does not have to sneer to be stylish. William
Grimes reviews the restaurant, which he says takes its
food seriously -- perhaps even too seriously.

$25 and Under: A Traditional Cook-It-Yourself Korean Feast

The New York Kom Tang Kalbi House recalls a time not long
ago when Korean restaurants were cloistered in several
blocks of Midtown. Eric Asimov prefers the way Kom Tang
serves their tabletop grill, with braziers filled with
natural wood charcoal.

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 17th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

"The Insider from Travelocity.com","Please respond to feedbackRomance in Paradise!
Dear Peter,
Everyone has their own definition of paradise. For some it's 
unspoiled beaches and lush tropical jungle. For others it's a more

you're one of those people who thinks a place called ""Sin City"" 
sounds just about perfect, we can help you, too. However you like it, 
Travelocity can help make it happen. Whether you're traveling with 
your sweetie, or just into the romance of traveling, Travelocity can 
help you plan and book the perfect trip. And that sounds like 
paradise to us. Destination Guides Reservations engine

Importance:	High

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

"Notes from DTI Customer Meeting","DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 25, 2001

Texas Eastern Transmission, LP (Texas Eastern) notifies all customers
that, for the reasons described below, scheduled receipts into and
deliveries out of the system must match actual receipts into and
deliveries out of the system.  This system-wide warning is issued as a
result of actual receipts into the system significantly exceeding actual
deliveries.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern?s
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (OFO) requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Easterns FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"(01-184) Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the NYMEX Division","
Notice # 01-184
May 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder on Use of Money Market Funds as Original Margin Deposits on the
NYMEX Division

DATE:
May 31, 2001
===========================================================
This Notice is a reminder regarding certain rule changes and related policy
guidelines that will go into effect on June 1, 2001 for the NYMEX Division.
The rule changes going into effect on June 1, 2001 on the NYMEX Division
allow shares of certain money market mutual funds to be acceptable for
purposes of original margin deposits.

Corresponding rule changes for the COMEX Division  have also been approved
by the NYMEX Board of Directors and filed with the CFTC; the changes for
the COMEX Division will be implemented at a later date.

     Rule Amendments
The amendments generally require that in order to be used for such purpose,
a money market fund must be approved by the NYMEX Board and also must
comply with CFTC Regulation ? 1.25.  For purposes of original margin, the
Exchange's Clearing House will value such money market fund shares at 95%
of their market value.  In addition, a Clearing Member's participation in
any approved fund or any group of approved funds offered by the same issuer
shall be limited to the greater of $250,000 or 25% of the Clearing Member's
total original margin obligations. Finally, no more than 25% of the total
assets of an approved money market mutual fund may be used to meet original
margin obligations at the Exchange.

Exchange Policy on Money Market Funds
The NYMEX Board of Directors also recently adopted three additional

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Iron horse

The lousy economy is masking steady improvement at the nation's largest
railroad Union Pacific.

By Michael Sivy

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - As October draws to a close, the stock market is
being forced to digest some nasty news. On the economic front, there were
negative earnings forecasts and fears of a massive debt default in
Argentina. Reports of new anthrax cases and the growing belief that the
U.S. has lost the initiative in Afghanistan further undermined investor
confidence. In addition, many mutual funds that close out their fiscal year
on Oct. 31 were ""window-dressing"" -- dumping losing stocks that they don't
want to have in their portfolios when they next report to shareholders.

The overall result was that the stock market opened lower on Monday and
fell throughout the day. At the close, the Dow was down 275 points, or
nearly 3 percent, while the Nasdaq was almost 4 percent lower.

Still, nothing has really changed. Eventually, the economy will turn, and
many top-quality growth stocks with great franchises and strong financials
are clearly cheap. Among them: tech leaders, such as Applied Materials and
Microsoft; health-care giants, such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson;
depressed entertainment stocks, such as Disney; and top financial services,
such as Citigroup, MBNA and Fannie Mae.

STOCKS TO CONSIDER
Applied Materials
Citigroup
Fannie Mae
Johnson & Johnson
Microsoft
Pfizer

There are less-glamorous stocks, however, that are advancing under the
radar, particularly cyclical businesses that have been reducing their costs
and are now poised for big earnings gains when the economy finally
rebounds. A good case in point is the railroad industry -- and particularly
the nation's largest railroad, Union Pacific.

The current company was created in 1996 when the old Union Pacific acquired
Southern Pacific. The merger was a strategic masterstroke on paper -- and a
practical disaster. Difficulties integrating the two railroads went far
beyond the usual post-merger stumbles. Rail traffic jams in Texas became a
mess that took years to sort out. As a result, Union Pacific's share price
has yet to surpass its 1996 high -- in fact, it is currently 30 percent
below that level.

Nonetheless, the company has slowly been getting its act together. Traffic
problems have been resolved, and much of the excess overhead resulting from
the merger has been eliminated. Because business remains weak, however,
very little of this progress is evident.

Today Union Pacific (UNP: down $1.18 to $50.25, Research, Estimates)  is
the largest U.S. railroad, both in track miles and in freight revenue. The
company's rail network covers the western two-thirds of the country with
major links both to the East Coast and to Mexico. Union Pacific's customer
mix is highly diverse, including low-sulfur coal and agricultural products.

Revenues have basically been flat this year. Lower costs and cheaper energy
prices have offset this top-line weakness, allowing Union Pacific to post a
4 percent earnings gain in third-quarter results, which were announced a
couple of weeks ago.  And analysts expect these trends to continue through
the first quarter of 2002.

As the economy improves next year, however, earnings could shoot ahead at
better than a 20 percent annual rate and continue to grow in the low teens
over the next five years. At a current price of $50 a share, Union Pacific
trades at only 12 times next year's projected earnings. Moreover, cash flow
is more than double net income. That means plenty of cash will be pouring
in to improve the company's balance sheet from a B+ to an A. Relative to
cash flow, Union Pacific's stock is about as cheap as you can get -- and
the upside leverage in a recovery is considerable.

November 25, 2001

Due to continued unseasonably mild weather and shippers filling contract
storage inventories in anticipation of the coming winter heating season,
Texas Eastern has virtually no storage capacity or linepack available
for system operational purposes and cannot continue to absorb imbalances
left on the system.

Pursuant to Section 3.3 of Rate Schedule TABS-2, Texas Eastern offers to
permit TABS-2 Parties to decrease physical receipts of gas into the
system by an aggregate quantity of 300,000 Dth/d.  Any decreases in gas
receipts pursuant to Rate Schedule TABS-2 will not reduce such TABS-2
Parties? scheduled deliveries, whether at a TABS-1 Service Point or city-
gate markets.  This request for decreased receipts under TABS-2 is
applicable for the STX, ETX, WLA, and ELA TABS-2 Service Points.  All
requests for decreased receipts under Rate Schedule TABS-2 will be
accepted on a first-come, first-served basis.  After Texas Eastern?s
operational need for decreased receipts has passed, Texas Eastern will
notify all participating TABS-2 Parties and such parties will have a
reasonable time to come back into balance.  Any TABS-2 party willing to
decrease physical receipts into the system should contact their Account
Manager.

Waiting for the payoff

Cable television independent Comcast has a terrific franchise, but the
stock has gone nowhere. Now it looks ready to pay off.

By Michael Sivy

Sometimes businesses have great franchises and are well run, but you'd
never know it from the share price. Momentum investors would tell you to
dump such a stock because the market just doesn't like it. Not me. It can
sometimes take three or four years for a stock's price to catch up with its
fundamentals, and if you're really a long-term investor, you should be
willing to wait. As superstar investor Warren Buffett says, the stock
market transfers money from the active to the patient.

A perfect case in point is Comcast [CMCSK], the No. 3 cable television
company (after AT&T and AOL Time Warner, the owner of this website). I
recommended Comcast stock in December 1999 at $52 a share and over the next
five months it fell 40 percent to around $30 a share, at which point I
recommended it again. Now, at $44, I still like what I see.

There were several reasons for last year's decline. Most cable stocks
dropped in the initial phases of the Tech Wreck (although most of them
turned up long before other tech stocks did). Comcast also suffered after
reporting lower-than-expected earnings for last year's first quarter, in
part because of expenses associated with acquisitions. In addition, because
85 percent of the company's voting stock is held by insiders, the potential
for a takeover doesn't support the stock when it becomes undervalued.

Comcast's dealmaking may have hurt reported earnings last year, but it has
greatly enhanced the long-term value of the company's franchise. Through
strategic sales, purchases and swaps, Comcast has sharpened the focus of
its cable territories, which are centered on the greater Philadelphia
market. In addition, Comcast has aggressively upgraded its systems to use
the latest digital technology. Moreover, the company has valuable
investments in other businesses, including a 57 percent stake in the QVC
home-shopping network.

Over the past year, Wall Street analysts have become increasingly bullish
on Comcast's future, and two have recently upgraded the stock to a ""strong
buy"" in advance of the company's first-quarter earnings report expected on
May 8. The reason: Two important trends are bullish for the cable TV
industry as a whole, and Comcast is at the forefront of each.

First, cablers are poised to reap the benefits of technological
improvements, including digital video, interactive television, cable modems
and cable telephone service. Second, the industry will finish a series of
very expensive upgrades next year and will then enjoy several years of
lower capital spending. That means that the torrent of cash the cable TV
business generates will be available to companies to reduce debt, buy back
stock, raise dividends, make strategic acquisitions or otherwise increase
shareholder value.

At the current $44 share price, Comcast trades at 18 times next year's
estimated cash flow. That's a fair valuation and could look very cheap a
couple of years from now as Comcast cashes in on its first-rate technology
and enjoys soaring free cash flow.

"(01-186) Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit...","
Notice # 01-186
June 1, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division and COMEX Division Clearing Members

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of Amendments on Use of Letters of Credit, Certain
Securities and Deliverable Warehouse Receipts as Margin  for NYMEX and
COMEX Transactions

DATE:
June 1, 2001
===========================================================

1. Implementation of Rule Amendments. As previously announced in Notice to
Members #01-147 (May 4, 2001), this Notice is to remind NYMEX and COMEX
Clearing Members of rule amendments that become effective today, June 1,
2001, that expand the types of non-cash assets that customers may deposit
with their Clearing Members for margin purposes.

2. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit. Clearing Members are
further advised that a form has been prepared by the Exchange that will
serve as the authorized  uniform form for irrevocable letters of credit for
use on a pass-through basis at the Exchange.  This form may be obtained
from the Exchange's Clearing Department.

3. Exchange Form for Pass-Through Letters of Credit: Specification of Joint
Beneficiary. The Pass-Through Letter of Credit differs from the Standard
Letter of Credit in that the Pass-Through Letter of Credit provides for
Joint Beneficiaries.  In this regard, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the NYMEX Division should specify NYMEX as one of the
Joint Beneficiaries.  By comparison, a Pass-Through Letter of Credit to be
used as margin on the COMEX Division should specify the COMEX Clearing
Association as one of the Joint Beneficiaries.

4. Restriction on Issuers of Letters of Credit. Please note that, under
applicable NYMEX and COMEX rules, a Clearing Member that is a bank
subsidiary or is an affiliate of a bank may not deposit with the applicable
Clearing House a letter of credit issued or confirmed by such bank, bank
parent or affiliate bank.




As to the actual rule amendments, which are attached below, these rule
changes permit the use of letters of credit, certain securities and
deliverable warehouse receipts by customers to meet their margin
requirements. The rule changes provide for consistent treatment in the use
of such assets for both NYMEX and COMEX Divisions.

Letters of Credit.  As a result of the rule changes, letters of credit
(LCs) now will be allowed for customer margin on both divisions.

Use of Letters of Credit on Pass-Through Basis.  In addition, the rule
changes allow letters of credit to be used on a ""pass-through"" basis on
both divisions.  In other words, Clearing Members on both divisions will be
able to pledge to the applicable clearinghouse certain LCs posted by
customers. It should be noted that while securities and deliverable
warehouse receipts, as detailed below, may be used by customers for margin
purposes, such assets may not be used on a pass-through basis by a Clearing
Member to meet its margin obligations with the clearinghouse.

Securities. Customers also will be able to deposit with their Clearing
Members certain types of securities as margin. The types of acceptable
securities are the kinds of securities that have been accepted for some
time on the COMEX Division.  Specifically, the rule changes will permit
customers to deposit the following types of securities as margin with
Clearing Members on either division:

securities listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or the
American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the over-the-counter
market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
Board except that such securities must be free from liens and encumbrances;
can represent no more than 5% of the issued and outstanding shares of any
one issuer; and will be valued for purposes of margin at 75% of their
market value.

Deliverable Warehouse Receipts. On both divisions, deliverable warehouse
receipts for any of the commodities traded on the Exchange will be accepted
as customer margin provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at
no more than 75% of the value of the commodity.

If you have any questions concerning this change, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance Section,
NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928; or Charles Bebel, Vice
President, Clearing Department, at (212) 299-2130.


AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 4.01 (""CUSTOMER'S MARGINS""), NYMEX RULE 9.05
(""MARGINS"") AND TO COMEX CLEARING ASSOCIATION RULE 48 (""DEPOSIT OF
SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT AS ORIGINAL MARGIN"")

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

Rule 4.01. CUSTOMER'S MARGINS

(A) Initial margin at least equal to the level set for customers shall be
required of all customers. In no case shall a customer's initial margin be
less than a specified amount per contract, or a specified percentage of the
market value at which any commodity is bought or sold, such customer's
margin to be determined and announced by the Board of Directors or its
designee.

 (B) Once the required initial margin has been deposited for each
individual transaction, such trade and such margin shall, for the purposes
of this rule, lose their individual identity and be commingled with all
other trades and margins in the same commodity for the same customer
account.

 (C) When the margin (Net Liquidating Value plus Non-Cash Deposits) in a
customer's account declines below the maintenance margin requirement
applicable to the open positions carried in such account, the Member Firm
carrying said account is required to collect (call) from the customer such
funds, which when deposited, will restore it to the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (D) A Member Firm shall not accept orders for new trades on behalf of an
undermargined customer account other than those which reduce its initial
margin requirement unless such Member Firm has been given assurances by
said customer that funds sufficient to restore the account to its then
prevailing initial margin requirement are forthcoming and will be received
in a reasonable amount of time not to exceed one business day for Floor
Members and three business days for all other customers.

(E)(1) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more
of the following forms as margin to cover open NYMEX Division positions:

 (a) United States Currency; or any currency freely convertible to United
States currency; provided that if foreign currency is deposited, its value
shall be calculated so that at the current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar
equivalent of the foreign currency satisfies the customer's margin
obligation.

 (b) securities issued by the Department of the Treasury of the United
States maturing within ten (10) years of the date of the deposit and
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States Government.
Such securities shall be valued at ninety five percent (95%) of par value.

*(c) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in
the over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free
from liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued
and outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of
the market value thereof;

(d) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.

(e) deliverable warehouse receipts for commodities traded on the Exchange
provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more than 75% of
the value of the commodity.*

[(c)] *(f)* The net liquidating value in a customer's account over the
initial margin requirements for the positions carried for such account.

(2) A Member Firm may accept deposits from its customers in one or more of
the following forms as margin to cover open COMEX Division positions:

(a) United States currency, checks payable in United States currency, or
currency freely convertible to United States currency; provided that if
foreign currency is deposited, its value shall be calculated so that at the
current rate of exchange the U.S. dollar equivalent of the foreign currency
satisfies the customer's margin obligations;

(b) the net liquidating value in a customer's account over the initial
margin requirements for the positions carried for such account;

(c) securities issued or guaranteed by the United States, provided that
such securities shall be valued at the lower of the par or market value
thereof;

(d) securities which are listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Inc. or the American Stock Exchange, Inc., or which are traded in the
over-the-counter market approved for margin by the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve Board provided that such securities; (i) are free from
liens and encumbrances; (ii) represent no more than 5% of the issued and
outstanding shares of any one issuer; and (iii) are valued at 75% of the
market value thereof;

(e) *deliverable* warehouse receipts *for commodities traded on the
Exchange provided that such receipts will be valued as margin at no more
than 75% of the value of the commodity*; [provided that such warehouse
receipts shall be valued in accordance with the following:

(i) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the commodity
underlying either the futures contract sold or the futures contract which
is the subject of the call options sold, not more than 90% of the value of
the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(ii) if the warehouse receipt is for a deliverable grade of the futures
contract purchased or the put options sold, not more than 75% of the value
of the commodity may be considered as margin; and;

(iii) if the warehouse receipt is for either: (A) deliverable grade of a
commodity other than the commodity underlying the futures contract or
option to be margined; or (B) a form of silver or gold not deliverable
under a futures contract, then not more than 75% of the value of the
warehouse receipt may be considered as margin.]

(f) physical commodities (but not forward contracts therefor) if the
carrying member is in possession and control of negotiable documents
covering such commodities, provided, however, that the value of such
commodities shall be based upon the contract market price for the grade of
such commodity or if the commodity is not of a grade deliverable on a
contract market, then at the price for the grade of such commodity on the
spot market;

(g) a letter of credit in favor of a clearing member carrying an account*,
or in the case of any letter or credit to be used on a pass-through basis
with the Clearing House a letter of credit in favor of the Exchange.  All
letters of credit shall be* issued in such form as may be prescribed by the
Exchange and by a depository which has been approved by the Exchange for
issuance and confirmation of letters of credit drawn in favor of the
Clearing Members *or in favor of the Exchange, as applicable.*

 (3) Calls issued by Member Firms for additional margin from customers may
only be met by: deposits conforming to the requirements of Rule 4.01(E)(1)
for open NYMEX Division positions, or conforming to the requirements of
Rule 4.01(E)(2) for open COMEX Division positions, or, for open positions
on either division of the Exchange, favorable market movements which, when
taken into consideration and combined with any other monies available,
enable the customer's margin to equal or exceed the then prevailing initial
margin requirement.

 (F) Withdrawals of margin from a customer's account may only be permitted
by a Member Firm carrying such account if the remaining funds in such
account are equal to or in excess of the then prevailing initial margin
required of the applicable open positions at the time of said withdrawal
request.

(G) The customer's response to a margin call issued by a Member Firm must
be timely and complete. A Member Firm may call, at any time, for margins
above and beyond the minimums required by the Exchange. A Member Firm may
liquidate any or all positions maintained by a customer for failure to meet
a margin call. The customer will be liable for any loss or deficiency
resulting therefrom.

 (H) The margin requirements established by the Board or its designee may
vary for different commodities and may be changed from time to time by the
Board or its designee, and in the discretion of the Board or its designee,
may be made applicable to all open trades as well as new trades.

 (I) Arbitrage

(1) For the purposes of Exchange margin requirements, an arbitrage position
is a purchase or sale of an Exchange futures contract in one delivery month
which futures contract is offset by a futures contract to sell or to
purchase a similar quantity of a related commodity in the same or different
delivery month which offsetting futures contract is executed on or subject
to the rules of a different exchange. In order to qualify as an arbitrage
position, each contract long and short must be carried by the same member
firm for the same account.

(2) The Board of Directors, by resolution, may identify those futures
contracts, that are executable on and/or subject to the rules of a
different exchange, which shall be deemed to qualify as part of an
arbitrage position.

(3) The Board of Directors or its designee may set levels of margin for
arbitrage positions at a rate less than applicable to outright positions;
provided, however, that except for interdivision straddles, no such rate
shall be lower than the rates established for clearing members' margins.


Rule 9.05. MARGINS

*    *    *    *
(E) Clearing Members may meet original margin calls by depositing:

(1) Cash (U.S. Currency);

(2) Original Margin Certificates issued by an original margin depository,
in form acceptable to the Clearing House, for delivery to the order of the
Clearing House, representing securities issued by the Department of
Treasury of the United States of America maturing within ten (10) years
from the date of the deposit and guaranteed as to principal and interest by
the United States Government; such securities shall be valued at ninety
five percent (95%) of the par value; or

(3) Subject to a maximum limit of 50% of the Clearing Member's total
original margin obligations, Irrevocable Letters of Credit payable to the
order of the Clearing House *including such Letters of Credit that are
deposited with the Clearing Member in accordance with Exchange procedures
by a customer*, in form acceptable to the Clearing House, issued by or
confirmed by an original margin depository and having an expiration date of
not less than three (3) or more than eighteen (18) months from the date of
issuance; provided, however, that such Letter of Credit may not be used to
meet original margin obligations during the fifteen calendar days prior to
the expiration date thereof (if the fifteenth day prior to the expiration
of the Letter of Credit is not a business day, the period during which such
Letter of Credit may not be used to meet original margin obligations shall
begin on the business day immediately preceding that day); and, provided
further, that on the business day!
!
 preceding the fifteenth calendar day prior to the expiration of the Letter
of Credit, the Clearing House shall issue a call for original margin to be
deposited in a form and manner acceptable to the Clearing House for
positions held open as of the close of business on that day and margined by
the Letter of Credit. The Clearing House shall have the unqualified right
to call on any Letter of Credit at any time prior to expiration.

CCA Rule 48. DEPOSIT OF SECURITIES AND LETTERS OF CREDIT A ORIGINAL MARGIN

*    *    *    *
(b) Irrevocable Letters of Credit.

(i)  The Corporation will accept as original margin for the full face
amount thereof a letter of credit in favor of the Corporation issued by any
institution selected by the depositor *including such Letters of Credit in
favor of the Corporation that are deposited with the Clearing Member in
accordance with Exchange procedures by a customer*, provided that

(A)  such  institution has been approved by the Board as an approved
depository or such institution is organized under the laws of the United
States or the laws of any state and the letter of credit issued by such
institution has been confirmed by an approved depository;
(B)  that the aggregate amount of letters of credit which may be accepted
at any time from any one approved depository, or for the account of any one
Clearing Member may be limited by the Board from time to time;
(C)  that a letter of credit issued on behalf of a Clearing Member by an
institution which is an affiliated firm of such Clearing Member must be
confirmed by an institution which is not an affiliated firm of such
Clearing Member; and
(D)  such letter of credit shall be in form and substance approved by the
Board and shall be in such denominations as may be determined by the Board
from time to time; shall be irrevocable, shall be available to be drawn
upon by the Corporation by  a clean sight draft(s) or written demand(s) and
shall run for a period of not less than ninety (90) days from the date of
issue.

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Winning a loser's game

Companies that make the fewest mistakes will fare best in the current
market. And 3M is trying to not miss a trick.

By Michael Sivy

Some sports, such as football, are winner's games. The team with the most
successful offense wins. Others, such as golf, are loser's games. Players
don't defeat their opponents -- victory goes to the person who makes the
fewest mistakes. What kind of game is the stock market? That depends on
what type of market you're in.

Bull markets are basically winner's games. If you take as much risk as you
can stomach, chances are you'll be rewarded. The broad upward sweep of
share prices will make up for any minor errors in timing or stock
selection. But when you're in the midst of a bear market, realize that
you're playing a loser's game. Anything that goes wrong -- a slight
shortfall in earnings, for example -- will have a disproportionately
negative impact.

Right now, investment success hinges on not losing, and the smartest
strategy is to favor companies with a high degree of consistency and
predictability. Such companies typically have strong finances,
well-diversified product lines, a balance between domestic and
international sales and a long history of dividend increases. One stock
that fits that description is Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, or 3M
[MMM], which recently raised its dividend for the 43rd consecutive year.

At first glance, the results 3M reported on Monday look pretty good for a
near-recession economy. Earnings were up 3 cents a share on a 2.3 percent
gain in revenues. Analysts were cautionary, however, because the company's
U.S. revenues were down -- all the gains came from international sales,
which account for half the company's business. I don't have a problem with
that. Domestic sales are off because we're in the middle of an economic
slump. I see the fact that foreign business is supporting the company's
growth as a sign that 3M is well-diversified. The bigger issue, though, is
how the company will fare when the U.S. economy rebounds.

I recommended 3M last July at $88.50 a share as a stalled growth stock that
would get a higher valuation once growth picked up again. Since then, the
share price has risen more than 30 percent to $116.50. And I see further
gains ahead, as domestic sales improve over the next few quarters. For more
than a year, the company has been fine-tuning its product mix, which
includes more than 50,000 items ranging from electronics, medical devices,
and automotive parts to Scotch Tape and Post-it Notes.

That restructuring seems to be accelerating under new CEO W. James
McNerney, 51, formerly the CEO of GE's Aircraft Engine subsidiary. Analysts
applaud the speed with which McNerney has developed a comprehensive
cost-cutting plan since taking over on January 1. Along with first-quarter
earnings, 3M announced it would be shedding 5,000 jobs worldwide, or 7
percent of its workforce. In addition, 3M is planning to up its research
and development spending. The goal: deriving at least 20 percent of 2005
sales from products that don't even exist yet.

This year, earnings gains will likely be held to 5 percent or so, which
makes the stock look fully valued with a P/E of 24. But with a leaner cost
structure and an improving product pipeline, revenue and earnings growth
could accelerate starting in 2002. And that's the kind of outlook that
makes for winners, not losers.

"(01-156) NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules","
Notice # 01-156
May 9, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
NYMEX Post-Close Trading Session Rules

DATE:
May 8, 2001
===========================================================

This Notice advises Members and Member Firms of changes to the two
post-close session rules applicable to the NYMEX Division.

!    As a result of amendments to both rules, the post-close sessions
generally offered Monday-Thursday will be the same as the Friday sessions
with two exceptions.

!    Monday-Thursday. These sessions will start at 3:25 p.m. and will be
two minutes long.

!    Fridays. These sessions will start at 3:30 p.m. and will be five
minutes long.


End of Week Post-Close Trading Session (Rule 6.57A)

As a reminder and as a follow-up to a Notice distributed last week, please
be advised that beginning on Friday, May 11, 2001, a number of amendments
to NYMEX Rule 6.57A, the NYMEX End of Week post-close trading session rule,
will become effective. The new version of this rule is attached below.

For Friday post-close sessions (and for post-close sessions the day before
a mid-week Exchange holiday) the following changes will be in effect:

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The sessions now will be 5 minutes in duration.

(3)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks


Monday-Thursday Post-Close Trading Sessions (Rule 6.57)

In addition, please be advised that beginning on Monday, May 14, 2001, a
number of amendments to NYMEX Rule 6.57, the Exchange's post-close trading
session rule for days other than Fridays, will become effective.  The new
version of this rule is attached below.

(1)  Eligible contract months will be expanded from the first four to the
first 12 consecutive listed contract months.

(2)  The trading range for these sessions will be expanded by adding the
following ticks above (below) the
daily high (low) for the applicable contract month (provided that this
expanded trading range does not violate the maximum permissible price
fluctuation limits then in effect):

Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

(3)  Customer participation will be expanded to the same extent as is
permitted for the End of Week Post Close Session. Please note that any
order submitted during the RTH session, including but not limited to
resting orders such as stop orders, limit orders and good until cancelled
(GTC) orders, will be deemed to have expired as of the end of RTH for
purposes of this Session.  Accordingly, in the event that a market
participant with such an expired order seeks to participate in the Session,
a new order must be submitted.

(4)  As a consequence of the expanded trading range and customer
participation, trades done during this period will be price reported on
PRS.

Finally, please be advised that, as a matter of practice, the Exchange does
not currently offer post-close trading sessions for Propane futures
contracts.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)
299-2207.

Exchange holiday falls on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday on the trading
day preceding such midweek Exchange holiday, there shall be no post-close

Session'') shall commence on the trading floor pursuant to this rule and
subsequent to the close.  Except as otherwise provided by the President or
the President's designee for a particular trade date, such End of Week

session, including but not limited to resting orders such as stop orders,
limit orders and good until cancelled (GTC) orders, will be deemed to have

submitted.

(D) Prices for trades executed during the End of Week Session shall  be
reported on public ticker services;

(E) Current market prices and trades executed during the End of Week

"$218 rt or less usa/canada/coast-to-coast"," Today's Hottest Travel Deals from Bestfares.com!
 
This week, we find summer travel to Europe a little soft, but we do expect many new deals in the very near future. On the international front, Canada looks awfully good--especially for travel to Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa through August 31, 2001. We have airfares ranging from $171 to $191 roundtrip from cities such as Miami, Orlando, Tampa, New Orleans, Austin, San Antonio, Nashville, Knoxville, Charlotte, Raleigh, Norfolk and Colorado Springs. West Coast area fares start at $226 and include San Diego, Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. On the domestic front, our best travel deals are for those flying in twos. Phoenix and Columbus (OH) are the hottest cities averaging just $158 per person, per couple from select cities. Travel between 56 other U.S. cities and the average ticket price per person is still only $218. We also have new offers to the South Pacific, Mexico and the Caribbean, as well as free stopovers in London, Rome and Milan for summer travel. Read the stories below and find your best destination, and of course, your best fares. 
TAKE OFF TO CANADA FROM $135 RT THROUGH AUG. 30, '01 
Even though we are super proud of our special reduced airfares to Europe, wait until you see these great fares to Canada, for travel through August 30, 2001. Many of these discounted fares only require a three- or seven-day advance purchase. Sample airfares to Toronto, Montreal or Ottawa include Pittsburgh at $135; Milwaukee at $148; Kansas City, Austin, San Antonio, New Orleans, Raleigh, Charlotte, Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale and Miami at $171; Phoenix from $229; San Diego and Seattle at $226; Colorado Springs at $222 and Portland (OR) at $211. Visit 
http://www.bestfares.com/travel/desks/story.asp?id=55  
TAKE A FRIEND COAST TO COAST FOR $60 RT THROUGH OCT. 26, '01 
If you're traveling in twos this summer, we have a new offer that will help you fly for less. Purchase one already-low, discounted fare for coast-to-coast travel between 58 city pairs, and you can take along one companion for only $60 roundtrip. Be flexible in your travel plans for the best savings. The lowest fares are available for the first traveler on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Travel on other days is available, but the fares increase by $40 each way. The $60 companion fare, however, is valid for travel any day of the week. Travel is valid through October 26, 2001, and a seven-day advance purchase is required on most routes. If you need to fly between Chicago, Detroit, Providence, Baltimore, Orlando or many more to Las Vegas, Reno, San Diego, Seattle or Portland (OR), the first traveler pays $376 roundtrip, and the second just $60 roundtrip. Other great markets include Phoenix to Fort Lauderdale, San Diego to Islip (NY), San Jose (CA) to New Orleans, Baltimore to Los Angeles, Hartford to Albuquerque, or Oklahoma City to Manchester (NH). Bring a friend and save big bucks by visiting 
http://www.bestfares.com/travel/desks/story.asp?id=22405   
COAST-TO-COAST 3-DAY ADVANCE PURCHASE FARES $198-298 RT 
If you're like most people, it's hard to plan something three weeks ahead. That's why we have three-day advance purchase airfares up to 60 percent off the standard 21-day advance fares. Plus, these fares only require a Friday night stay, giving you greater flexibility, and most are good for travel through October 15, 2001. You can travel between more than 50 U.S. cities with only three days notice and not break the bank. Visit

"Employee Referral Program","


	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"HHub Elec","Pete,

Here is what the new Henry Hub swap would look like on the website.  Prior to this going live, I will need to run it by Mark Taylor in Legal.  Let me know what you think.

US Gas Daily     HHub Elec               Oct01           USD/MM

A financial Swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by Counterparty on the Website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number days in the relevant Determination Period.  The Payment Date(s) will be 5 business days after the Floating Price is determinable. The Floating Price shall be the average of the Index for each day in the relevant Determination Period.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the Product description on the Website.
The Index for a day shall be the price published on such calendar day under the heading ""Electronic Trading Indices"" in the Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the price published on the next succeeding Business Day.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per day.

"BCP Seat Assignments","All:

Attached you will find a list that reflects your seat assignments for Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  These seats are located on the 30th and 31st Floors of Enron Center North (ECN).  As previously communicated, you will report to these designated seats in the event of an outage in ECS.

The exception to this is as follows:
If your seat assignment is located on the 31st Floor, you will report to your original location that you occupied prior to your move into ECS.  This will hold true until the Monday after Thanksgiving, as we will have the 31st floor seats set up at that time.

Testing:
Once you have moved to ECS, if you would like to test your BCP location, you will be able to test your seat for functionality every Thursday from 3-6pm.  Testing is not required, but is highly recommended.

If anyone has any questions or concerns about these procedures, please feel free to contact me at any time.

"Internet E-mail","
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Answers to questions about tech indexes, preferred stock, AT&T and Diebold.

By Michael Sivy

I've received a lot of questions and comments lately about the volatile
tech sector. So let me begin by explaining what I think is going on and
outlining my best guess about the outlook for the rest of the year. In
recent columns, I've been generally upbeat about the long-term prospects
for tech stocks, but I've also warned about the likelihood of a June
pullback, as companies begin to project weak results for the current quarter.

The bad news has already begun, with Sun Microsystem's warning on Tuesday
that its quarterly earnings would be well below expectations. The stock
plummeted nearly 13 percent on Wednesday and helped depress the Nasdaq
composite index by more than 4 percent. And the market is likely to remain
shaky until second-quarter reports are mostly out around mid-July.

I expect that business conditions will be starting to recover by the end of
the third quarter. The Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts take six to
nine months to work, and since the first cut was in January, we certainly
should be feeling the effect by Oct. 1. In the meantime, there will
probably be a lull, but that doesn't change the long-term case for big,
top-quality tech stocks. It just foreshadows a dismal summer.

Now here are answers to some specific questions:

Q. You've written about the Nasdaq-100 Trust and the SPDR technology
portfolio. What are they and where can I find them?

A. They are unmanaged index funds that trade on the American Stock
Exchange. You can buy them through any broker just as though they were
common stocks. The Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) [QQQ], which holds 100 Nasdaq stocks,
is the more aggressive of the two. The tech SPDR (XLK) [XLK] holds more
than 80 tech issues, but includes mature businesses like IBM that trade on
the New York Stock Exchange. Both, however, are a good way to buy a broad
cross section of big tech stocks to hold for several years.

Q. In ""The Bull is Back!,"" you recommend a Merrill Lynch preferred stock.
Where can I find it?
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/010518a.html ]

A. I think preferred shares are a worthwhile alternative to bonds for
investors looking for fixed income. Many good-quality preferreds yield more
than 7 percent and they often can be bought in round lots costing less than
$2,500 (compared with at least $10,000 for a bond).

The biggest problem with preferreds is that they often can be called, or
redeemed, before maturity. Most preferreds are protected against calls for
four years or so, but some Merrill Lynch issues have longer call
protection. In the past, I've recommended Merrill Lynch
preferred F (mer-f), which appears in the Wall Street Journal preferred
stock table and currently yields 7.2 percent. (Preferred ticker symbols
vary from one financial website to the next. For the most recent quote on
Money.com, click here [MER-F].)
[ http://quote.money.com/money/quote/qc?symbols=MER-F ]
For more information on how preferreds work, see ""Preferred shares:
Uncommon values.""
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/001020.html ]

Q. What do you think about AT&T?

A. Frankly, I don't know what to think at this point. Chairman C. Michael
Armstrong was right that the company couldn't stick with its traditional
strategy. But the so-called broadband company he tried to build through
expensive acquisitions of cable companies hasn't solved the problem.

Now AT&T [T] is backtracking by splitting up again with planned spinoffs of
its wireless and cable TV operations. I figure that the share price is
cheap relative to the total value of AT&T's assets, but the company isn't
earning much money right now. To my mind that makes the shares a hold, on
the theory that sooner or later the asset value will show through.

Q. You've recommended Diebold before. What do you think of it now?

A. I basically like Diebold [DBD], a midsize tech stock that is a leading
maker of automated teller machines. Diebold's stock dropped more than 60
percent in 1998 as bank mergers and branch closings slowed demand for new
ATMs. And currently, demand is suffering from the capital spending slump
caused by the economic slowdown. Even so, the stock is up 50 percent to
$30.25 a share over the past 18 months -- and it has gained a couple of
bucks since I last recommended it in November.

Capital spending should improve over the next couple of years. Diebold's
earnings look to be flat this year, but should be up more than 10 percent
in 2002 and could grow at nearly a 15 percent compound rate over the next
five years. Best of all, the stock is cheap at only about 16 times
estimated earnings for the current year.

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Global Markets 
In a combined effort, Global Risk Markets (GRM), a unit of Enron Global Markets, and Southeast Power Origination, part of Enron Americas, closed Enron's first Contingent Call Outage Option in the 1st quarter 2001. The product was created to provide customers with a cost effective risk management tool to hedge against high commodity prices after experiencing an unplanned power generation outage.

The transaction was entered into with UtiliCorp United to manage its generation risk for summer 2001. This risk is associated with a forced outage of their largest coal unit during peak summer demand. The transaction, which was developed jointly with the Southeast Power group, highlights the benefits of cooperation between business units within Enron. GRM is working with a number of business units to integrate this risk management product into other Enron businesses to enhance value to our customers.  For additional information on the product, please call David Hoog in the New York office at 212 702 3920.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Travel Tip of the Week:  Book non-refundable tickets. Airlines typically allow unused non-refundable tickets to be applied towards subsequent travel. Even if you need to make a change at a rate of $100, in many cases the change fee plus the ticket price is still less than a refundable ticket.
	For example:  Houston to Washington, D.C.
	     Refundable:		$ 1,447
	     Non-refundable      	$    540

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"FW: Enron Europe Organization Announcement- VOLUNTARY LAYOFFS","

Subject:	FW: Enron Europe Organization Announcement- VOLUNTARY LAYOFFS



Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this.   However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the ""back burner""and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

"Enron Center South (ECS) Move Back-up Plan","


A backup seat and a backup computer have been assigned to you.  Please read this communication in detail.


Purpose:  Net Works has developed a backup plan for possible work stoppages after moving to the new building.  A wider business continuity plan will be rolled out next year.

Location:  Large areas of the 30th and 31st floors of the current building, Enron Center North, will be set aside for recovery purposes.  Your name has been put on the list and you will be notified once the seat assignments are finalized.  Locations will also be posted at the entryways on the 30th and 31st floors.

Timing.  Through November, backup seats assignments will be announced as each trading group moves to the new building.  The backup seats will be available at least to January 1st.

Testing.  Test times to try the backup PC and to familiarize yourself with your backup location will be announced by the IT team as the locations are finished.

Telephones.   Only regular phones will be available.  For those with speed dial phones, the IT team will download the numbers and leave them on a piece of paper at your seat assignment.  Because the numbers change frequently, we ask that you rely on keeping track of the numbers yourself and use the number lists as a last resort.
 
Other supplies.  The IT team is not responsible for non-technical or special needs.  If you rely on hard copy forms, address books, etc, you will need to be sure to leave appropriate supplies when you test the computer, or bring supplies along if you are asked to move to your backup seat.

Limited Access.  The backup floor is not meant as a backup day-to-day work environment.  To keep the equipment functioning and secure, we plan to limit access except for test times and if we need to invoke the plan because of a work stoppage.  

Escalation Procedures.  The plan will be  as follows:  

I.	During regular business hours

A.  Announcement.  You will be notified via the PA system if you need to move to the backup location.  

-OR-

B.  No Announcement.  If an obvious problem like a fire or power shutdown occurs, for example, all personnel with a seat assignment will be expected to make their way to their backup seat without notification.


II.	After hours

For after hours issues, greeters will announce the move to the backup location as people arrive to work.  E-mails and voice mails will also be distributed.

"Final 2 days; usa, europe summer super sale"," Today's Hottest Travel Deals from Bestfares.com!
 
There are just hours left to take advantage of some of the best fares for summer 2001 travel. This could be your last chance to take advantage of free stopovers in London, three free hotel nights in London and discounts up to $700 off for travel to Dublin, Shannon, Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Milan, Frankfurt, D?sseldorf and several other European cities. For travel across the U.S., you just can't beat our $174-178 roundtrip or less airfares through October 26, 2001. From the East Coast to the West Coast, pick the right cities and we've got you covered. Also, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Hawaii and Tokyo are all on sale. Now, for the bad news--unless we can convince our suppliers to extend these sales, many will expire this Thursday, May 24, 2001. We are working hard for an extension, but our chances are as good as a coin flip. We suggest making your purchase by Thursday. Don't miss out on this summer super sale that can save you super big bucks. Read the stories below for the appropriate links. 
FINAL 2 DAYS: NEW LOWER FARES TO EUROPE WITH FREE LONDON STOPOVER, FREE HOTEL NIGHTS & QUADRUPLE MILES 
As we stated a few weeks ago, new lower fares to Europe have arrived at Bestfares.com with supersonic speed. For the next four days only, we have been able to cut these prices back even more. Destination cities include Amsterdam, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin, D?sseldorf, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Nice, Paris, Rome, Shannon, St. Petersburg and Venice.

"Corporate Culture","Pete,

Just a quick note to see how things are going down there?  I'm sorry to hear
that Enron's on some tough times, hope you're area is safe.  Got to love
paying Andersen for their quality financial statements huh?  Old AA is in
hot water for their F/S for Enron, Waste Management Inc. and couple other
companies.  Their getting some pretty bad press and rightfully deserved,
since all they've tried to focus on is building up a consulting firm years
before the inevitable split with Andersen Consulting (Accenture).

On a personal side, hope you, Anne and the girls are doing ok.  Kim and I
move into our new place on Monday.  Of course we were supposed to move in
back in September, but what can you do.  We're cutting it close to Kim's due
date, but if she keep her legs together until after Monday we should be ok.

New address:	80 Ellison Avenue
		Bronxville, NY  10708

Phone		(914) 337-7510 (same as before)


I'll catch up with you later.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like ""Industry Overviews"" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
""We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,""  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

"Cliff Baxter","It is with sadness and regret that we announce that Cliff Baxter is resigning as an employee of Enron.  We are happy, though, that Cliff's primary reason for resigning is to spend more time with his family.

Cliff is a unique talent.  His creativity, intelligence, sense of humor, and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career.  He will be missed.

Cliff joined Enron in 1991 and was a key member of the team that built Enron's wholesale business.  Before becoming Vice Chairman of Enron, Cliff served in a variety of positions in Enron's wholesale businesses, culminating in his appointment as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Enron North America in 1999.

We have asked Cliff, and he has agreed, to continue in a consulting role for the company while concluding negotiations on a number of key asset dispositions.

Please join us in thanking Cliff for his service to the company and in wishing him the very best.

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Cabernet sauvignon is one red everyone seems to love. Here's
a selection of cabernets for all price ranges:

von Strasser Winery 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$50 - Don't listen to the talk of '98 as a mediocre vintage
in California. This is a classic Napa Valley cabernet with
the intensity of mountain-grown fruit and the telltale
opulence of von Strasser.
4 stars
http://www.winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=19233

Seven Hills Winery 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$28 - This Washington State winery is producing concentrated
and intense cabernets. Beautiful ripe fruit flavors are
backed up with touches of spice and a supple texture.
4 stars
http://www.winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=19737

Vina Carmen 1998 Cabernet Sauvignon
$15 - Chile is a country producing many affordable
cabernets. Try this organic wine, which is deep, intense and
full of unique minty character.
4 stars

4. Multimedia: Video Instruction for Preparing Salmon
=====================================================

Learn some of the less common and possibly more intimidating
approaches to salmon, such as curing, hot smoking and raw
marinating.
http://www.nytimes.com/cooking?0606wd


5. NYC Restaurants: Lutece Steps Into the Future
================================================

Lutece, under the new chef David Feau, is trying to project
a more contemporary image while retaining an old-fashioned
sense of luxury. William Grimes gives it two stars.

6. Readers' Opinions: Peppermills
=================================

From the superiority of ground pepper to matching wine with
food, readers share their insights and answer fellow
readers' questions.

Q. I have recently been told by a few friends that using a
peppermill is better than using pre-ground pepper. Are there
different kinds of peppercorns and how do you select what
kind to buy? -- LoisFEP

A. There is absolutely no comparison between freshly ground
peppercorns and the powdery stale stuff that comes in those
little cans. Going to a peppermill is probably one of the
best ways of making your cooking taste better. . . .

"See Jim Cramer's Personal Portfolio","Please respond to Dear RealMoney.com Subscribers,

It's hysterically funny what people are demanding
of my personal account. People want it updated
immediately and they want the ideas ahead of when
I actually buy (I am doing that). In fact I am letting
our readers front-run me on everything! I reveal what
I am about to recommend and I recommend before I buy.

That's the total antidote to the way Wall Street works.
They want to know how much money I am putting into each
stock. Done. They want the dates that I did it. Harder
because I buy in small increments. They want my stop-loss
limits if I could stop-loss out. I can't do that because
of my holding period, but I will do it anyway and just
not sell. They want better performance and they want it
yesterday or at least when I started this game, and the
market was much higher.

Hey, I am listening! Exclusively on RealMoney.com, you
now have access to my own Personal Portfolio, which is
made up of my picks, shares owned, basis, current value
and gains that he buys and sells on a day-to-day basis.

As of Friday, the portfolio market value is $1,247,537
making me a profit of $124,650.03.

Don't miss a move, click here to see what I am up to:

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

Zinfandel has a cult following unlike any other grape
variety. We're not talking about the wimpy white kind,
either. Every January more than 5,000 Zinfandel fanatics
converge on San Francisco to taste the serious red stuff at
one of the largest tastings in the country. What's so great
about America's classic grape? Give these wines a try and
you'll see:

1998 Peterson Winery Bradford Mountain Zinfandel
$22 - Many Zins are known for their powerful,
take-no-prisoners style, but this lovely wine is elegant,
restrained and full of black cherry and plum flavors.
4 stars
http://winetoday.com/search97cgi/s97_cgi?Action=FilterSearch&SearchPage=result_end.html&collection=WineTodayReviewsEnd&Filter=result_end_filter.hts&ResultTemplate=result_end.hts&querytext=&wineid=20165&SUBMIT.x=28&SUBMIT.y=9

1998 Ridge Vineyards Geyserville Zinfandel
$30 - If there's a first-growth of Zinfandel then Ridge tops
the list. Complete with all the spice and ripe fruit

1998 Pepperwood Grove Cabernet Franc
$7 - Zinfandel used to be one of the best-value reds around.
Not true anymore. But here's a wine that offers bright
blueberry flavors, good peppery spice notes and still
carries an affordable price tag.

6. Readers' Opinions: The Perfect Barbecue Fire
===============================================

From building the perfect barbecue fire to the best methods
for saving open bottles of wine, readers share their
insights and answer fellow readers' questions.

Q. One of my family's GIANT outdoor grilling days is coming
up, and here's a problem that always troubles me: How do you
decide how many briquettes are going to be enough? How do
you know when the fire is hot enough to cook without
cremating? How do you get it to last until everything is
done? -- KennethRay

A. Those chimney-style fire starters work *really* well, and
you can have briquettes ready to go in a very short time . .

Subject:	March of Dimes

Hello All--

Shelley Corman has asked me to forward the attached letter to you regarding Enron's fundraising efforts on behalf of the March of Dimes.  

Please take a moment to review--any contribution you can make would be greatly appreciated and will be matched 100% by Enron.

Please ket me know if you have any questions or need any additional information

Thanks!
  
Please make checks payable to the March of Dimes and send to me at Location EB3275F. 
 
==========================================================================================================================
Dear ENA Team Member:
 
I am proud to serve as a sponsor of Enron's March of Dimes 2001 Walk Team.   March of Dimes is a national nonprofit organization whose mission is to improve the health of babies preventing birth defects and infant mortality.  Childhood health is a cause near and dear to my heart.   
 
Obviously, it is a cause that is near and dear to Enron employees as well.  Last year our Enron team raised over $46,000.   This year our team has set a goal to raise $75,000.  With your help, I believe we can achieve this aggressive goal. 
 
I understand that you are called upon to donate your time and money to many worthy causes and clearly I am not a seasoned fundraiser.  What I can tell you is that I am proud of our employees that have rallied a grassroots effort to support March of Dimes here at Enron.  I am committed to continuing their work.  I ask that you consider making a donation in any amount.  

Please use the attached envelope to make your donation to the March of Dimes and forward you check back to me by Friday, April 27th.  Your contribution is totally tax deductible and Enron will match your gift dollar for dollar (I will take care of the matching paperwork).  
 
Thanks, in advance, for your donation and support of the March of Dimes.  You can read more about the March of Dimes at www.modimes.org.  
 
Sincerely,

Suzanne Calcagno

"Sivy on Stocks: A bounce for the brokers","Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 2, 2001

A bounce for the brokers

Stocks such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley were up at
least 5 percent on Wednesday -- and appear poised for even bigger gains.

By Michael Sivy

Most of the people I know are bearish on the shares of the company they
work for. Particularly when business conditions are as difficult as they
are right now, employees tend to focus on the short-term problems their
companies are facing and ignore the long-term fundamentals.

Perhaps that's the explanation for why analysts have recently been
downgrading brokerage stocks. They look around their offices and see
depressed profits and layoffs. Merrill Lynch's earnings fell 21 percent in
the first quarter, for instance, as commissions declined 30 percent,
trading revenue fell 15 percent and underwriting revenue dropped more than
6 percent. Things are so bad that Merrill Lynch and other major firms are
planning to slash their head counts -- by attrition in some cases and
outright layoffs in others.

But those short-term problems mask the fundamentals that long-term
investors should be paying attention to. At the most basic level,
brokerages are proxies for the stock market, so if you expect a resumption
of the bull market in the near future -- as I do -- you have to like the
sector.

And the fundamentals figure to keep improving. The economy should receive
an enormous boost over the next nine months from the Federal Reserve's
recent interest-rate cuts. And a large tax cut will encourage consumer
demand. Plus, concessions to Congressional Democrats that allow for higher
government spending will add further stimulus. Finally, potential Social
Security reform that permits some form of privatization would be a direct
benefit to financial-services firms.

The stock market has already recognized what the brokerages' own analysts
haven't. Stocks of the leading brokerages were up 5 percent on Wednesday,
and many have rallied at least 25 percent from their 52-week lows.

Still, these shares are hardly overvalued. Even after Wednesday's rally,
the stocks are anywhere from 15 to 35 percent below their highs of the past
seven months. Moreover, they still trade at less than 18 times estimated
earnings for the current year. That isn't much given their projected
long-term earnings growth of 13 percent or more.

Among the leaders in the group, Goldman Sachs [GS], with a 13 percent
growth rate, closed Wednesday at $98 a share for a 17 P/E; Merrill Lynch
[MER], 13 percent growth, traded at $67 for a 17.5 P/E; and Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter [MWD}, 14 percent, closed at $66.50 for a 16 P/E.

Investors might also want to consider A.G. Edwards [AGE] as an undervalued
takeover play. The leading independent brokerage based outside of New York,
A.G. Edwards of St. Louis trades at $43 for a P/E of less than 14. The
trend toward financial services behemoths threatens to chip away at
Edwards' market share. But industry consolidation could also make Edwards a
takeover target, not only for major brokerages but also for the big banks.
Whether the stock is taken over or not, it's cheap based on fundamentals --
especially since it got up to nearly $58 a share when takeover rumors
heated up last summer.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Subject:	FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 24, 12:00 PM
FERC Approves Transco's Leidy Project, Petal Expansion, New ANR Lateral 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued draft orders Wednesday for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's Leidy East expansion in Pennsylvania, a pipeline and deliverability expansion at Petal Gas Storage in Mississippi and a new ANR lateral to serve to 1,050 MW Badger power plant in Kenosha, WI. 
Transco's $98 million Leidy East pipe expansion project would make up for the failed Phase III portion of its MarketLink expansion. The Leidy East project will provide up to 130,000 Dth/d of transportation from Leidy, PA, to northeastern markets in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. The expansion consists of six pipeline loop segments that amount to 26 miles of 42-inch diameter pipe, and about 5 miles of 30-inch diameter, mostly in Western PA. The project also would add 3,400 hp of compression in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
Williams said this summer that it expects the Leidy East facilities to be in service by November 2002 (see Daily GPI, June 20 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20010620e.html>). The Williams subsidiary said Aquila Energy Marketing, PECO Energy Co., Reliant Energy Services and Williams Energy Marketing are all customers. 
Petal Gas Storage LLC's new pipeline would extend 59 miles to a connection with Southern Natural at a compressor station near Enterprise, MS. The $94 million project also includes a new 9,000 horsepower compressor station. 
ANR Pipeline's lateral will carry about 210 MMcf/d of gas to Badger Generating Co's proposed power plant in Wisconsin. The 13-mile long pipeline would cost $19.5 million and should be in service during the summer of 2003.

"(01-154) Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (Give-Up Trades) IMPORTANT MEMO","
Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.


If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Wine Picks: Leslie Sbrocco's Cellar Suggestions

If you're looking for affordable Italian red wine, don't
automatically grab for a Chianti, try a bottle of Barbera.
Well-known examples come from Northern Italy and the region
of Barbera d'Alba, but California is also home to impressive
new bottlings.
See our WineGuide for more information:
http://winetoday.com/wineguide/encyclopedia/wg_encyclopedia_entry_174.html

1999 L'uvaggio Di Giacomo Il Gufo Barbera
$15 - This small Napa Valley producer makes one of the
hottest Barbera bottlings around. Juicy and supple, it's a
wine to enjoy immediately.
4 stars

1998 Easton, Shenandoah Valley, Barbera
$18 - A big league California Barbera with serious fruit
flavors. Ripe and full-bodied, this is an Italian-style red
meant for a side of beef hot off the grill.
4 stars

1998 Vajra, Barbera d'Alba
$15 - The real deal from Italy. Vibrant cherry flavors pair
with soft tannins in a wine that captures the essence of
good Barbera.

What We're Reading[IMAGE]  War Letters : Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars 
by Andrew Carroll (Editor), Douglas Brinkley (Introduction)
 From a treasure trove of over 50,000 submissions, Andrew Carroll selected 150 letters, spanning 130 years of warfare from the Civil War to Bosnia, to create this remarkable collection. Most were written by uncelebrated but dearly loved soldiers from barracks, trenches, and flooded foxholes, as well as combat journalists, nurses, and family members on the home front. His rich sample testifies to the universal and poignant themes of love and honor, courage and rage, duty and fear and mortality. A major contribution to the understanding of war and its impact, and a powerful tribute to those undone by it. 
  Our Price: $22.40  You Save: $5.60  (20%)     [IMAGE]  Ghost Soldiers: The Forgotten Epic Story of World War II's Most Dramatic Mission 
by Hampton Sides
 In January 1945, 121 Army Rangers slipped behind enemy lines in the Philippines to liberate 513 comrades--the last survivors of the Bataan Death March--being held in a concentration camp. In Ghost Soldiers, journalist Hampton Sides recounts both the hellish imprisonment as well as that daring rescue. Thrilling from start to finish, his book celebrates the heroism of hundreds of warriors, and brings renewed attention to one of the Rangers' finest hours.

 Following in the footsteps of the greatest Spanish adventurers, Michael Wood retraces the path of the conquistadors from Amazonia to Lake Titicaca, and from the deserts of North Mexico to the heights of Machu Picchu. Few stories in history match these conquests for sheer drama, endurance, and distances covered, and Wood's gripping narrative brings them fully to life. The stories in Conquistadors are not only of conquest, heroism, and greed, but of changes in the way we see the world, history and civilization, justice and human rights. --From the publisher

An Interview with Patrick O'Donnell[IMAGE]  Beyond Valor: World War II's Ranger and Airborne Veterans Reveal the Heart of Combat 
by Patrick K. O'Donnell
 A pioneering oral historian, Patrick O'Donnell used his Web site, The Drop Zone, to solicit personal histories from individual soldiers willing to share their experiences. The result, Beyond Valor, is a moving and often brutal firsthand look at World War II from the perspective of Rangers and Airborne veterans. In an  interview with Amazon.com , O'Donnell explains the ""hidden war"" behind the official histories and why it's vital that such stories be told before they are lost forever.

History Bestsellers[IMAGE]  Close to Shore : A True Story of Terror in an Age of Innocence 
by Michael Capuzzo, Mike Capuzzo
 Michael Capuzzo tells the harrowing story of the real-life Jaws that helped inspire Peter Benchley's classic novel (and movie). Modern science now tells us that shark attacks are exceedingly rare and limited to just a few species. Yet they do occur, and one of the most terrifying episodes of fatal attacks occurred near the New Jersey shore in 1916, when a renegade great white shark went on a man-eating spree that left three adults and one boy dead. Good summer reading--but don't take it to the beach.

by Don Kladstrup, et al
 It's a well-known fact that Adolf Hitler did not like wine. Still, the Germans showed no distaste for French wine when they invaded France in 1940. Indeed, among the first acts of the occupying army was to seize great stores of wine, sending tens of thousands of barrels to the Third Reich and ordering the conversion of thousands of hectares of vineyards into war production. Wine and War recounts a fascinating and little-known subplot of World War II.

Subject:	System Imbalance Notice

October 24, 2001 

To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and 
Shippers 

Re: System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive 
negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of 
receipts) on its system throughout the month.  Effective 
immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional 
negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.  Absent 
voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to 
suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.

Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further 
notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its 
pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently 
allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers 
with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the 
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with 
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to 
the 4% tolerance levels. Transco will not enforce these pool 
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, 
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits 
identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may 
proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies 
at pooling points.

If you have any questions, please call Terry Fitch at (713) 215-
3361 or John McGrath at (713) 215-2514.

Volunteers will help play with the kids, ages 2-12.  It is so much fun and a short time commitment.  Volunteers get a FREE Museum membership as a thank you.  Please respond by May 16 to Jennifer Milligan X35272.


Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.

"Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition","
After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

"Questionable Mail/Suspicious Packages","The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.

Shattered glass

Reflections from the Corning debacle.

By Michael Sivy

NEW YORK (CNNmoney) - I receive e-mails from time to time taking me to task
because stocks that I like have gone down. Not surprisingly, these e-mails
have become more frequent in the past six months as the bear market has
worsened. But not all stock market disappointments can be fully explained
by the recession. Some stock disasters are genuinely shocking and seem to
violate all the principles that usually keep investors out of serious
trouble. Such cases are worth special consideration and analysis.

There is no stock that has surprised me more over the past year than
Corning, the world's leading maker of fiber optic cable. Had you told me a
year ago that Corning (GLW: down $0.12 to $7.90, Research, Estimates)  was
going to drop from more than $100 a share to less than $8 today, I would
have said that was practically impossible. And yet it happened.

The fundamental case for Corning seems unassailable. The former maker of
high-performance glass discovered that the company's expertise could be
much more profitably employed in high-tech than in making ovenproof
cookware. The burgeoning telecom market had a seemingly endless appetite
for fiber optic cable. And Corning quickly became the world's biggest
producer with 40 percent of the market. Moreover, the company not only was
the big-volume producer but was also the leader in the most-profitable
cutting-edge fiber optics.


Then came the problems

Only trouble was that telecom companies became so overconfident in the late
1990s that they laid far more cable than they actually needed. In fact,
there will be excess capacity for at least another 12 months. Needless to
say, few customers are going to order a lot of cable from Corning in the
interim. So sales volume in some product lines is down more than 50 percent.

In its third-quarter report, released after the market closed on Thursday,
Corning announced a 74 percent drop in operating earnings to 9 cents a
share. And that was the good news. Aftertax restructuring costs for the
quarter were $222 million. More restructuring charges are still to come.
The fourth quarter will likely result in an operating loss of at least 20
cents a share. And Corning's chief fiber optic cable plants will be idled
for at least two months.

At this point, there are three questions that need to be answered. Where
does Corning go from here? Is there any point at which it would be a
contrarian buy? And finally, is there anything to be learned from the
situation?

If I owned individual tech stocks rather than indexes, I would have owned
Corning, I would have held it throughout the decline -- and I certainly
wouldn't sell it here. The company remains the dominant player in fiber
optic cable. And for all the cable that has been laid, there is still 10
times as much left to do. Moreover, when the wiring starts again, Corning
will profit from being the technological leader with the best high-margin
products.

On the negative side, Corning is spending somewhere in the neighborhood of
$1 billion on restructuring. Less than half of that is in cash and Corning
has more than $1.5 billion on hand, so serious financial problems are
unlikely. But they are possible if business deteriorates far more than
anyone expects. At this point, I would treat Corning stock like an option.
The upside is enormous -- three or four times the current price in a couple
of years. But the risk is much greater than usual for a stock of Corning's
quality.

The most basic truth to be learned from the Corning story is that your
reasoning can be impeccable and you can still lose your shirt on a stock.
Corning seemed to have everything going for it -- leadership and
technological dominance in a market with a very high core growth rate and
an exemplary balance sheet. Corning is the poster child for
diversification. The goal is not so much guarding against obvious risks,
but rather guarding against risks that can't happen -- but do.

Two final thoughts. Corning traded as high as 91 P/E last year, and market
historians will tell you that as a rule no company sustains a P/E of more
than 50 for any length of time. There's just not enough good news in the
world for that. Finally, one-product companies -- no matter how brilliant
that product may be -- always carry special risks. In the short run at
least, the market for Corning's fiber has turned out to be an optical
illusion.

"Sivy on Stocks: Staggering toward profits","Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
May 4, 2001

Staggering toward profits

The economic numbers are hard to sort out, and some analysts are talking
about stagflation. The best stocks for this environment include consumer
products companies like Procter & Gamble.

By Michael Sivy

The most recent economic data all contradict each other. First we hear that
real gross domestic product grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the first
quarter -- a stunner, because just about everyone was expecting growth to
be down from the 1 percent rate of the fourth quarter. So no need to worry
about recession, right? But then we get employment data that shows payroll
numbers tumbling and unemployment up from 4.3 percent to 4.5 percent. In
addition, inflation pressures -- particularly labor costs -- are moving
ominously higher. Economists are starting to talk about stagflation, the
awful combination of inflation and low growth. The last time they did that
we had an oil crisis and a horrific bear market.

Don't take any of this too seriously. Confusion and economic cross-currents
are normal at this point in the business cycle. What we're seeing now is
the regular churning that occurs as the economy completes a slowdown and
struggles to get back on a growth track. For investors, the key is to
isolate the trends that really matter.

The most important one is that the economy as a whole is still growing.
Despite lots of scattered bad news, we still haven't has a single quarter
of declining GDP. We might get one, but it's hard to imagine that we'll get
two really bad quarters back to back -- and that's what defines a
recession. At worst, it looks as though we'll get what they used to call a
""growth recession"" back in the 1960s -- a drop more or less to zero, but
not a meaningful decline.

That's basically good news for corporate profits. Companies can maintain
earnings during a brief growth recession by cutting costs. And a modest
rise in unemployment is also positive for corporate America, because it
makes jobs easier to fill, and restrains labor costs.

An uptick in unemployment is also likely to encourage the Federal Reserve
to cut interest rates. The majority of Fedwatchers expect chairman Alan
Greenspan to reduce rates at least a quarter percentage point at the next
Fed meeting on May 15. The continuing trend toward lower rates will
encourage home refinancing, which will add another $100 or $200 a month to
some household budgets and help keep overall consumer spending healthy.

What stocks are most timely at this point in the cycle? As I've said
before, I think that the big money over the next five years will be made on
the largest tech stocks. Nearer term, I think we could see strong
performance among defensive consumer stocks -- the shares of companies that
sell everyday products. No one is going to stop buying toothpaste or
detergent because of a mild economic slowdown. And a whiff of inflation is
actually good for consumer stocks because it makes it easier to raise
product prices.

One obvious candidate is Procter & Gamble [PG], with brands that include
Tide, Ivory, Head & Shoulders and Charmin. The stock has dipped since I
last recommended it, but since April 24, P&G has risen 12 percent. And I
expect that rally to continue.

P&G has a number of big issues. The company is in the midst of a
restructuring, and it could take a while to work through all the kinks. In
addition, P&G is bidding to acquire Clairol from Bristol-Myers Squibb. But
over the next year, P&G should emerge from its restructuring as a more
focused collection of extremely attractive businesses. What matters most
now is that the stock is depressed and that sales won't be exposed to any
significant economic downturn.

This past week, P&G announced a surprisingly solid 9.4 percent gain in
operating profits for the first quarter. Much of that was from price
increases. Still, analysts thought the results were encouraging, and
Salomon Smith Barney upgraded the stock to ""outperform."" Full-year growth
this year and next may be only around 7 percent, but P&G's growth rate
could be back above 10 percent by sometime next year. Add in a 2.1 percent
yield, and you're talking about above-average total return potential. At a
current price of $64 a share, P&G is trading at less than 21 times this
year's estimated earnings. That's pretty cheap, and any successful results
from the restructuring would just be gravy.

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook

Power Plants Returning to Natural Gas as Prices Fall: Outlook

     Palatka, Florida, June 2 (Bloomberg) -- Natural gas is
burning again at Florida Power & Light Co.'s Putnam power plant in
Palatka.
     Last winter, Florida's largest utility reconfigured the plant
to run on fuel oil instead of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fuel
that for years had been comparatively cheap. Last month, as gas
prices plunged to a 10-month low, the plant switched back to gas.
     Florida Power & Light wasn't the only one. Many electric
utilities in the U.S. are able to burn both fuels, and several are
making the switch to gas, which is now cheaper than oil in some
regions. Companies such as Detroit Edison Co. had been burning oil
since the winter.
     ``It wasn't really until the early May timeframe, when gas
and oil prices crossed paths and gas became cheaper,'' that the
switch was made, said Gary Lapplander, the company's manager of
fuel supply. Michigan's largest electric utility had been running
its 780-megawatt Greenwood plant near Port Huron on oil since last
December.
     Fears of winter shortages drove natural gas futures on the
New York Mercantile Exchange to a record $10.10 per million
British thermal units in late December, more than quadruple the
year-earlier price. This year, prices have fallen below $4, partly
because last year's rally caused so many generators and industrial
customers to seek alternate fuels, such as oil.

                           Saving Money

     Fuel can account for more than 90 percent of a power plant's
operating costs, according to some estimates.
     Mild weather across the U.S. this spring has reduced demand
for gas to heat homes and power air conditioners, while record
drilling in the past year has led to higher gas flows from U.S.
wells. Since late March, utilities have been pumping gas into
underground storage at almost three times last year's rate,
according to American Gas Association figures.
     Fuel oil has a much different story. Prices for No. 6
residual fuel oil -- the grade most commonly burned in power
plants -- are linked to crude oil prices, which have climbed 4
percent this year.
     The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has cut
crude oil production twice this year after raising it four times
in 2000. And refiners have been sopping up supplies in recent
months to make gasoline for the summer driving season.
     Natural gas prices at Chicago's distribution hub fell below
fuel oil prices during the week ended May 18, the first time it
was cheaper in almost seven months, according to Bloomberg
figures. Fuel oil prices in Chicago are little changed this year.
     ``It's really a factor of economics,'' said Carol Clawson, a
spokeswoman for Juno Beach, Florida-based FPL Group Inc., parent
of Florida Power & Light, which can switch about a quarter of its
power plants between gas and oil on a few hours' notice. ``We are
detecting gas prices coming down, and as that occurs, we are going
back to gas.''

                          Fear of a Rally

     To be sure, some power-plant operators may be wary of
switching back to gas because of the chances for a rally this
summer, said Tim Evans, senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus in
New York. As hot weather arrives, homeowners and businesses will
turn up their air conditioners, pushing electricity use higher and
lifting gas demand. Natural gas futures last summer rose 29
percent.
     Adding to that demand, gas-fired power plants with about
25,000 megawatts of capacity are expected to start up this summer,
according to a U.S. Energy Department report published last month.
Last year, about 22,000 megawatts of new gas plants started up,
boosting total U.S. gas demand by 500 billion cubic feet, or 2.3
percent. A megawatt is enough to light 1,000 homes.
     Other variables in the gas market include the extent of any
heat waves this summer, and whether hurricanes will enter the Gulf
of Mexico, disrupting operations at offshore rigs that account for
a quarter of U.S. production.
     ``People don't fully trust gas,'' Evans said. ``They're
wondering if it's going to remain the cheaper fuel, or if it's
just going to turn around and do to them what it did last
winter.''

                           Still Cheaper

     Oil is still cheaper than gas in some regions. In the New
York City area, where utilities don't have to pay as much to get
oil delivered from tanker terminals in New York harbor, heavy fuel
oil costs $3.89 per million Btu, compared with $3.99 for natural
gas, according to Bloomberg figures.
     Even so, the drop in gas prices has prompted Brooklyn, New
York-based Keyspan Energy Corp. to increase gas's share of its
total power generation to about 40 percent, said company spokesman
David Manning. That's up from about 3.5 percent at one point last
December.
     Normally, almost all of the company's plants would be burning
gas at this time of year, Manning said. Keyspan produces power for
about 1.1 million customers on Long Island.
     ``We're right on the cusp'' of gas prices falling low enough
to switch the remainder of the company's generation away from oil,
he said. ``We would anticipate we will be running on gas even more
this summer, unless something dramatic happens with the weather.''

"Sivy on Stocks: Construction project","Please respond to Sivy on Stocks SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com

Construction project

The need for aggressive oil exploration and new electrical power plants
should be a bonanza for firms like Fluor that can manage such projects on a
global basis.

By Michael Sivy

It may seem hard to believe today, but back in the 1970s, one of the
hottest stock groups was Construction and Engineering. These C&E firms
managed mega-projects, including oil refineries and pipelines in the Middle
East, and were minting money because of the oil shortage. But during the
past decade, the energy crisis seemed like only a distant memory. And even
the best C&E firms, such as Fluor [FLR], ran into trouble.

For most of the late 1990s, Fluor's earnings were stagnant. The company
over-expanded in 1994 and subsequently began missing its growth targets. As
the problems got worse, the stock fell from a high of $75 a share in 1997
to less than $23 early last year.

To fix these problems, Fluor decided it would be smart to split the company
in half, separating its C&E businesses from its coal-mining operations,
which now trade as Massey Energy [MEE]. Since the split late last year,
Flour has been doing well and appears poised for even better times to come.

But this improved performance has gone unnoticed by many investors because
the division of the company and the shift of its reporting schedule from a
fiscal to a calendar year have made earnings comparisons difficult. In
fact, some research sources have stopped following the stock altogether.

That's a pity because the outlook for energy is better than it's been in a
decade. The scare of higher crude prices should greatly improve prospects
for oil projects, while electricity shortages in California -- and possibly
in other states as well -- will encourage the construction of power plants.
In fact, a joint venture between Duke Energy and Fluor is one of the
world's leading contractors and has the largest U.S. market share for the
construction of natural-gas-fired power plants. Two weeks ago, the
partnership was awarded a contract to help build two power plants in
Massachusetts.

Fluor's share price has climbed more than 50 percent since its
restructuring, and several major brokerages have upgraded the stock to a
""buy"" on the strength of Fluor's improved business outlook.

At a current $51 a share, Fluor trades at 26 times this year's estimated
earnings. Profits are projected to gain 18 percent next year and then
continue to grow at a core annual rate of about 15 percent. And those
estimates could easily prove to be too low if the climate for energy turns
out to be more positive in the next five years than it has been in the past
five. And to me, that looks like a pretty good bet.

"(01-168) Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A","
Notice # 01-168
May 17, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX and COMEX Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Revised Implementation Date for New NYMEX Rule 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

DATE:
May 16, 2001
===========================================================
Previously, in Notice to Members #01-154, the Exchange stated that new
NYMEX Rule 9.11A
(""Give-Up Trades"") would go into effect on June 1, 2001.  The Exchange is
revising the implementation timeframe in order to provide Floor Members and
Member Firms with additional time to obtain necessary records and become
compliant with the requirements.  Accordingly, please be advised that this
rule now will go into effect beginning on the trade date of August 1, 2001.
Further, it is anticipated that a similar rule will be implemented for the
COMEX Division following final review and approval by the COMEX Governors
Committee.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term ""executing broker"" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A (""Give-Up Trades"")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The ""executing
broker"", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject (""DK"") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

Small is beautiful

Stocks with market caps of less than $7 billion are cheaper than the
market's giants -- and are likely to outperform them.

By Michael Sivy

For most of the past seven years, stocks with the largest market
capitalizations outperformed mid- and small-cap stocks. As a result, the
big guys grew more overvalued relative to smaller companies. In the wake of
the tech wreck that valuation gap is narrowing, but there's still a long
way to go. And that means opportunity.

Shares of the 300 largest companies -- those with market caps of roughly $7
billion or more -- trade at an average P/E of around 23. Smaller companies
have average P/Es in the 16 to 19 range. P/Es vary with companies' earnings
growth rates, of course, but right now smaller stocks offer growth at a
cheaper price. As investors realize what good deals are available, share
prices of those companies are likely to benefit from rising price/earnings
multiples. Here are three companies that look well worth further investigation:

T. Rowe Price [TROW] is a stock I've always liked. The share price has gone
nowhere since 1998 -- the stock traded in the high $30s back then and is
currently at $36.70. The reason, not surprisingly, is the economic downturn
-- mutual fund companies take such setbacks especially hard. But T. Rowe
Price seems to be past the worst -- the share price is up 25 percent since
the April lows. I view this stock as a lot more than just a cyclical play,
however. Mutual funds companies earn profits based on the dollar-value of
the assets they manage. And those assets grow in two ways. First, investors
can add new cash to funds. Except for a couple of months earlier this year,
inflows into stock funds have remained uninterrupted for most of the past
decade. That trend will continue as Americans become increasingly
responsible for providing for their own retirement. A fund company's assets
under management also grow, however, simply because the market rises over
time, increasing the total value of the stocks in the funds they run. So if
the S&P 500 returns 12 percent a year, T. Rowe's profits should climb a bit
faster. The shares currently trade at 24 times this year's estimated earnings.

St. Joe [JOE] is a special situation -- a real estate holding company that
controls a big chunk of the Florida panhandle. Much of the company's 1
million-plus acres -- or nearly 3 percent of the state -- is beachfront or
near-waterfront (within 10 miles of the Gulf Coast). St. Joe is a competent
developer of resorts and planned communities, but in truth the stock is a
play on the opening up of the Florida panhandle. Acreage there is cheaper
than along other parts of the Gulf Coast because of lousy transportation
and infrastructure. More highways and an enlarged airport are in the works,
however, and as they're completed land values could rise substantially. At
$25.70, the shares look a bit dear on a price-to-earnings basis, but St.
Joe is really valued on its assets.

Whole Foods Market [WFMI] operates a chain of more than 120 natural foods
supermarkets, making it the category leader. A quarter of the stores are in
California, and profit margins have been hurt there by power shortages.
Nonetheless, earnings were up more than 10 percent in the most recent
quarter. And the company has indicated that earnings could grow at a 15
percent-plus annual rate in the second half. Analysts believe Whole Foods
could more than double its number of stores over the next seven years,
simply by expanding to other parts of the U.S. The chain's compound
earnings growth is projected at up to 20 percent for the next five years.
At $56.30, the stock, which will soon split 2-for-1, trades at 26 times
this year's estimated earnings.

Steady profits

Companies like Johnson & Johnson that post consistent profit gains are the
best choice to balance volatile tech stocks.

By Michael Sivy

Tech stocks soared on Monday -- their fifth straight winning session. Over
the past two months, in fact, the Nasdaq Composite index has soared more
than 35 percent, fueled by falling interest rates and signs that the
economy is holding up reasonably well. Moreover, after five interest rate
cuts this year by the Federal Reserve, it's likely that the economy will be
in an upswing by next year and that tech stocks will go on to further big
gains over the next 12 to 18 months.

But even the most aggressive investors should think twice about putting too
much money into the tech sector. It will continue to be extremely volatile,
and might hit another air pocket before the economy begins a sustainable
recovery. Fortunately, there are several other stock groups with
above-average growth rates that can help balance a tech-heavy portfolio.
Companies with the most consistent earnings include broadly diversified
makers of drugs and other health-care products. And among those firms,
Johnson & Johnson [JNJ] stands out.

I last recommended J&J in April 2000 at a price of $77.50 and a
price/earnings ratio of 23 (see ""J&J bounces"").
[ http://www.money.com/money/depts/investing/sivy/archive/000417.html ]
At the time -- well before the downturn had even started -- analysts were
forecasting that the company would turn in earnings growth of 13 percent to
14 percent. And despite the unexpected economic slump, J&J has hit the
high-end of that target. As a result, the stock has gained 30 percent since
then to $100.50 a share. And all the indications are that the company will
be able to maintain its solid earnings growth rate through the rest of this
year and beyond.

A large part of J&J's consistency comes from the fact that it is so well
diversified. In addition to making well-known items such as Band-Aids,
Tylenol and baby shampoo, the company has a booming pharmaceuticals
business, as well as major biotech and medical equipment divisions. Among
drugs, one of J&J's hot new products is Procrit, used to treat anemia. And
the medical equipment division has a state-of-the-art stent -- used to prop
open clogged arteries -- that can treat abrupt vessel closure even in cases
that have traditionally been difficult.

But diversity is not the only explanation for J&J's success. The company
has been extremely deft in managing its portfolio of businesses, disposing
of more than 20 and acquiring more than 40 over the past decade. Most
recently, J&J announced in March that it would acquire Alza, a leader in
drug-delivery technology.

In addition, J&J has raised its dividend every year for the past 38 years,
most recently by 12.5 percent in April. At the same time, the company
announced that it would split its shares 2-for-1 on June 13, for
shareholders of record as of Tuesday's close.

Despite potential long-term returns averaging more than 15 percent
(including a 1.5 percent dividend yield), J&J still trades at a P/E 22
percent below those of other major drug stocks. That discount reflects
J&J's heavier dependence on over-the-counter health and beauty aids and a
less impressive new product pipeline than companies such as Merck and
Pfizer have. Nonetheless, J&J's 26 P/E looks rather low compared with its
growth rate. Adding such a stock to a portfolio of high-flying tech issues
is a no-tears formula for lower risks and more consistent returns.

"(01-137) Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm)","
Notice # 01-137
April 20, 2001

TO:
All New York Mercantile Exchange Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Rule Changes to Implement enymex(sm)

DATE:
April 19, 2001

===========================================================

Please be advised that the NYMEX Board of Directors has approved a number
of rule changes, which are summarized below, to incorporate the
implementation of enymexK. These rule changes, which have been filed with
the CFTC and thus may become effective at any time, will be implemented
upon the launch of enymexK.

An unmarked version of these rule changes can be found on the Exchange's
website.  A hard copy ""black-line"" version of the rule changes, which shows
changes from the current rules, can be obtained by calling Kelly Ann Neeson
at (212) 299-2217 in the Exchange's Legal Department.

The rule changes include the following areas: trading; position limits,
accountability and reporting; arbitration, Clearing Member obligations and
a summary disciplinary procedure for denial of access.

     Trading Rules
A number of changes are being made to existing rules to reflect the
roll-out of enymexK, such as expanding such rules to cover both NYMEX
ACCESS7 and enymexK.  For example, the NYMEX ACCESS7 error trade rule has
been retitled and revised to cover error trades occurring on either system.

EFP and EFS. Similarly, Rule 6.21B and 6.21C are the Exchange's rules that
respectively govern EFP and EFS transactions for futures contracts traded
only on NYMEX ACCESS7, i.e., electricity futures contracts.  These rules
will now also govern enymexK EFP and EFS transactions.

Settlement Procedures. New NYMEX Rule 6.52E (""enymexK Settlement Price
Procedures"") was modeled upon the current settlement price rule for
electricity contracts trading only on NYMEX ACCESS7. Thus, settlement
prices generally would be determined manually by the Settlement Committee,
or if the Settlement Committee was not available, by Exchange staff using
the same criteria used by the applicable Settlement Committee.  However,
one difference is that the electricity settlement rule provides that no
settlement price shall be established that would be lower than the best bid
or higher than the best offer that: (a) was for at least twenty-five (25)
contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and remained available
for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes of trading.  By
comparison, new NYMEX Rule 6.52E contains more general language that would
allow the Exchange to customize for each enymexK contract the bids and
offers that would be protected in the settlement!
 process.

Position Limits, Accountability and Reporting.  With regard to the four
physical delivery enymexK crude oil contracts, the amendments to NYMEX
Rules 9.26 and 9.27 provide for position accountability in the back months
and a spot month limit of 2,000 contracts for each of these four contracts.
Also, the Exchange's current hedge exemption procedures will be made
applicable to the enymexK contracts. With regard to the cash-settled
enymexK contracts, the rule amendments provide for position accountability
across all contract months. The amendments to Rule 9.34 establish a
reporting level of 25 contracts for each enymexK contract, the same
reporting level currently used for many other Exchange contracts. However,
NYMEX staff also has initiated discussions with CFTC staff regarding
possible regulatory relief to exempt market participants from these
reporting requirements to the CFTC for the cash-settled contracts.

Brokerage and Clearing Member Financial Responsibility. As to brokerage,
new Rule 9.04A (""enymexK Trading"") permits brokerage to be done for enymexK
products.  Section (C) of new Rule 9.04A clarifies that a Clearing Member
will be financially responsible for trades done for each account it
carries, even if there is a system malfunction.

     Arbitration Rules
The Exchange's arbitration rules are being amended to reference Non-Member
enymexK Users and to provide that disputes between a Member and a
Non-Member enymexK User or between Non-Member enymexK Users would be
subject to Exchange arbitration on a permissive rather than on a mandatory
basis.

     Summary Disciplinary Procedures
The sole disciplinary sanction that would be applicable to a Non-Member
enymexK User would be denial of further direct access to the system.
Consistent with this approach, new Exchange Rule 8.99A establishes a
summary disciplinary procedure that would allow the Exchange to take action
when necessary on an expedited basis.

Please note that Exchange Members who are enymexK Users also will continue
to be subject to Exchange rules.

If you have any questions concerning these rules, please contact
Christopher K. Bowen, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, NYMEX
Legal Department, at (212) 299-22200; or Brian Regan, Senior Associate
General Counsel, NYMEX Legal Department, at (212) 299-2207.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"(01-162) Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions","
Notice # 01-162
May 11, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Reminder and Clarification on NYMEX Division Post-Close Trading Sessions

DATE:          May 11, 2001
===========================================================
Reminder
Changes will be going into effect today, Friday, May 11, 2001 for the End
of Week post-close trading sessions and also, beginning on Monday, May 14,
2001, for the Monday-Thursday post-close trading sessions. The trading
range for all of these sessions will be expanded by adding the following
ticks above (below) the daily high (low) for the applicable contract month
(provided that this expanded trading range does not violate the maximum
permissible price fluctuation limits then in effect):
Crude Oil      20 ticks
Heating Oil         50 ticks
Unleaded Gas        50 ticks
Natural Gas         50 ticks

     Clarification
Previously, the trading range for the Monday-Thursday sessions was the
closing range for the applicable contract month. Exchange staff interpreted
the rule to provide that if a contract month did not trade during the
close, there would be no closing range and thus it would not be permissible
to trade that contract month during the post-close.  Now, as noted above,
the post-close session trading range on any day of the week will be an
expanded version of the daily range. Therefore, the Exchange is issuing the
following clarifications as to the contract months that can be traded
during a post-close session (on any day of the week):

1.   Only the first twelve listed contract months are eligible for trading
in the post-close.

2.   If a particular contract month does not trade during the RTH session,
it may not be traded during the post-close.

3.   It is not necessary for a contract month to trade during the close in
order to be traded in the post-close as long as it has traded during the
RTH session.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact George
Henderson, Vice President, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212) 299-2071; Rob
Stasi, Manager of Trading Floor Systems, NYMEX Floor Department, at (212)
299-2067, or Brian Regan, Senior Associate General Counsel, at (212)

Supersize this stock!

For six months, McDonald's has been battered by nonstop bad news. Now the
outlook is improving and the stock appears poised for a strong rebound.

By Michael Sivy

Since last fall, McDonald's has been hit with one problem after another.
The weak U.S. economy has been bad enough. But since half the company's
sales and operating profits come from overseas, McDonald's has been
severely hurt by the weak euro and the renewed scares about mad-cow disease
and hoof-and-mouth disease, which have reduced European beef consumption.
Finally, though, the outlook appears to be improving. Earnings trends may
remain unfavorable through the summer, but by the fourth quarter, business
should be back on track. That should mean a big payoff for contrarians who
scoop up McDonald's [MCD] today at prices just a few dollars above the
stock's 52-week low.

I last recommended the stock in December at $31 a share. At that price, 35
percent below the record high set in 1999, McDonald's looked like a great
value play, and the stock rallied 12 percent going into January. But it
began slipping back as soon as it became evident that business would not
immediately turn around. In fact, earnings per share fell 12 percent in the
first quarter.

Basically, McDonald's has been beset by a string of problems that have been
compounded by poor management choices. The first is the economic slowdown
in the U.S., which has depressed growth in same-store sales. In addition,
the company has relied too much on promotions and other marketing gimmicks,
which haven't been working well in the tougher economy.

More serious, however, has been the falloff in profits from foreign sales,
particularly in Europe. To compensate for the decline in beef consumption
and the chronically weak euro, which has reduced the dollar-value of
profits earned in Europe, McDonald's has been increasing the pace of
new-store openings. But that has only undercut existing stores, and
profitability has suffered.

Fortunately, those problems are all transient. As the U.S. economy picks up
again, domestic results should improve -- particularly if McDonald's is
successful with innovations such as cafes that offer Italian-style coffee
at prices cheaper than Starbucks charges.

International results should improve as the company diversifies its menu to
offer a wider range of non-beef items. But the key to better European
results is a revival in beef consumption, and a rebound in the euro, which
is likely after coins and bills actually start circulating in January. And
already, there is evidence that the beef scare has peaked and that
consumers are starting to order more burgers.

There's no question that McDonald's stock is cheap. The shares trade at 17
times earnings, compared with multiples that have been regularly in the
mid-20s since 1996. True, the rebound has taken longer than I expected. But
I think that we'll see earnings growth pick up toward year-end, and then
continue at a 12 percent-plus compound rate over the next five years. In
addition, the P/E should rise once it's clear that prospects are improving.
That combination should make McDonald's an above-average holding for
patient conservative investors.

"Enron Center South Occupancy","This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Office of the Chairman

"","Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian

"EGM Organization Update & Announcement","
The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

Aluminum shines

The economy should come back later this year, and classic cyclical stocks,
such as Alcoa, have already begun major upswings.

By Michael Sivy

Amid all the concern about technology stocks, many investors seem to have
forgotten that the traditional business cycle still exists. But while the
drop -- and the more recent recovery -- in tech has been the most dramatic
event in the stock market, companies in other sectors have felt the results
of the economic slowdown, too. In fact, many traditional cyclical companies
experienced a classic bear market that ended a few months ago -- and they
now appear to be in the first phase of a recovery that could last as long
as five years.

The biggest gains figure to be in industries that benefit both from
improving economic activity and from moderate increases in inflation. Chief
among these stocks are the producers of raw materials. Since the supply of
commodities can't change very quickly, prices are set largely by the level
of demand. As a result, an economic upturn can make commodities prices firm
up quite suddenly. Moreover, initial inflation pressures -- such as those
that have been reported in the past couple of months -- typically show up
in the prices of metals before they show up in manufactured goods and services.

Alcoa [AA] is a prime example of such a stock. The world's largest aluminum
producer, Alcoa's earnings hardly fell during the slowdown of the past nine
months. Growth is expected to revive and accelerate over the rest of 2001.
And next year, the company is projected to increase earnings more than 30
percent.

Alcoa's resilience has several sources. One has been aggressive cost
reduction. Alcoa has already trimmed annual costs by $1 billion and plans
to cut $1 billion more. In addition, the aluminum giant has been shedding
non-core assets, such as an alumina refinery in Australia and the Thiokol
propulsion business that it acquired through an acquisition. Over the next
couple of years, Alcoa should become a more focused and more profitable
company.

Despite all this good news, Alcoa's results have been held back by three
factors -- the general economic slowdown, the somewhat depressed aerospace
market and the West Coast electricity shortage, which has idled some
production capacity. All three, however, are about to improve. The economy
should be in a solid recovery by next year. The construction of commercial
aircraft should reach a peak in the next few years, thanks to new models
from both Airbus and Boeing. And power availability in the Pacific
Northwest will eventually recover as well.

The result will be an extraordinarily strong upswing in earnings that will
rival those of some tech stocks. Over the next five years, Alcoa's earnings
should increase faster than 15 percent annually. At $41.50, Alcoa is
trading at just about 20 times estimated earnings for the current year and
less than 16 times next year's projected results. That compares with an
average P/E of 18 over the past six years. For anyone looking to balance a
tech portfolio without sacrificing above-average growth, Alcoa is a perfect
choice.

Subject:	New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

SIVY ON STOCKS from money.com
April 30, 2001

Printing profits

Gannett is best known for publishing USA Today. But the company's local
papers and broadcasting properties make it the perfect play on a comeback
in advertising.

By Michael Sivy

It's too soon to say that the economic slump is over. But it's not too soon
to say that it will be over before long. Friday's surprising report on the
economy showed growth continuing at an annual rate of 2 percent, up from a
low of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2000. And while the growth rate
could dip again, the Federal Reserve's most recent interest rate cut pretty
much ensures that the economy will be expanding solidly next year.

To play the potential rebound, most investors have focused on the tech
sector. I too think there are some good tech buys, but the outlook for many
technology issues is complicated by a host of factors, from overcapacity in
the telecommunications industry to the number of bad loans held by lenders.
The simpler way to bet on a potential rebound is with the shares of
consumer and basic manufacturing companies.

Chief among these businesses are those that depend on advertising. The
collapse of the free-spending dot-coms at the same time that the broad
economy was turning down created an advertising climate that has been
little short of disastrous. And even a moderate economic comeback could
provide a huge lift to those media companies that depend most on advertising.

Gannett [GCI], best known for publishing USA Today, is a perfect example.
Although the heavily formatted broadsheet has been derided as ""McPaper,""
the journalistic equivalent of fast food, USA Today has a lot to be proud
of. At 2.3 million, it has the largest circulation of any U.S. daily. The
paper pioneered the use of colorful graphics and squeezes a lot of news in
a compact layout. I usually look at USA Today's business section first
every day, before I turn to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.

But Gannett's real upside lies in its other less-conspicuous properties.
The company runs nearly 100 local papers, which are often near-monopoly
outlets in midsize suburban markets. In addition, Gannett has 22 television
stations in 19 markets, scads of non-daily publications and websites, and
15 daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. Altogether, the company is
virtually an index fund for advertising spending.

In 2000, Gannett reported record earnings growth of 15 percent. In the
fourth quarter, the gain was only 11 percent because advertising trends had
already begun to weaken. That downtrend has continued, and for the first
quarter of 2001, profits were actually down 14 percent. The next few
quarters will be tough, but by 2002 earnings should be rising again -- and
media stocks typically discount trends in ad spending as much as a year in
advance. Gannett's stock hit bottom in September at $49 a share, and has
been rallying since then despite weakening earnings.

Longer term, the shares of this well-managed company look quite attractive.
Earnings figure to grow at a compound annual rate of about 13 percent over
the next five years. And at a current price of $64.55, the shares trade at
less than 18 times estimated earnings for the current year. That sounds
like a great format for capital gains.

Subject: TE Critical System Warning


November 26, 2001

As indicated by the Critical System Warning issued November 25, 2001,
based on anticipated system operations and weather conditions, as stated
below, TEXAS EASTERN TRANSMISSION, LP (Texas Eastern) is requiring that
all customers take immediate and prompt steps to eliminate excess
receipts and conform scheduled receipts to actual deliveries. This
system-wide warning is issued as a result of actual receipts into the
system significantly exceeding actual deliveries. This Critical System
Warning shall remain in place until further notice.

Weather in the market area continues to be unseasonably mild and
shippers have been filling contract storage inventories in anticipation
of the coming winter heating season.  At this time, Texas Eastern's
storage capacity is approximately 98% full.  As a result, there is
virtually no storage capacity or linepack available for system
operational purposes and Texas Eastern cannot continue to absorb actual
imbalances left on the system.

Because of the critical nature of this situation and the fact that Texas
Eastern no longer has the ability to further absorb imbalances being
left on the system, Texas Eastern requests that all customers coordinate
with their suppliers the actual quantities received into the system to
match actual customer takes in the market area.  No due pipe gas will be
accepted into the system until further notice.

If immediate action does not result in reducing the current volume of
gas being left on the system, Texas Eastern may be forced to issue an
operational flow order (""OFO"") requiring actual receipts of gas to match
actual deliveries out of the system, which will be subject to the OFO
non-compliance penalty of $25 per dekatherm.  In addition and as
provided for in Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Texas Eastern will take
any other actions as may be necessary to protect the integrity of its
system, including, but not limited to, suspension of OBA's.

"Enron Announcement","Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate selected: 
1.	L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for any damage to it. 
2.	Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 713-646-6165.

"(01-194) Amendments to NYMEX Division Position Limit and Reporting Rules...","
Notice to Members No. 01-194
June 7, 2001

CORRECTS AND SUPPLEMENTS PREVIOUS NOTICE TO MEMBERS NO. 01-191

All amended rules can be found on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.
website @ http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_191r.htm.

To:
All NYMEX Division Members
All NYMEX Division Clearing Members

From:
Neal Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

Re:
--   Amendments to NYMEX Division Position Limit and Reporting Rules
--   Amendments to Large Trader Reporting Requirements for Light Sweet
        Crude Oil and the Addition of Brent Crude Oil

The Board of Directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc. has
approved various amendments to NYMEX Division Chapter 9 rules which, in
general, move away from hard position limits ""in any one month and all
months combined"" to position accountability standards. These amendments
shall be effective as of the open of trading on Friday, June 15, 2001.

The amendments to any one month, all months combined and option quadrants
limits as cited in Rule 9.26, position accountability will provide for the
ability for any participant to exceed the prescribed levels. (As a note:
the levels advocated for any one month and all months combined are the
levels currently in place for all months combined under the existing rule
structure. The currently defined any one month limits, which are lower than
the all months limits, are being deleted. Additionally, the gross side of
market rules are deleted.) Any market participant exceeding the defined
position accountability levels will be subject to being contacted by the
Exchange when the Exchange deems it necessary, and will be required to
supply relevant information as to its position and the status of its
account. If the participant refuses to do so, or if the Exchange believes
the position, by its size, is a threat to the orderly operation of the
market, a market participant can be directed!
 either to not increase or to decrease its position.

The existing current delivery month on expiration limits as defined in
existing Rule 9.27 will be unchanged and subject to hedge/swap exemptions
as they are today. The only caveat to this is that certain cash-settled
enymexsm contracts will operate with some level of position accountability
in the current delivery month.

Further, the large trader reporting levels cited in Rule 9.34 for Light
Sweet Crude Oil futures has been amended from 300 to 350 contracts to
coincide with existing CFTC standards. The soon to be traded Brent Crude
Oil futures' reporting level has been added at the same level of 350
contracts.

Lastly, the any one month/all months position accountability level for the
Brent Crude Oil contract of 20,000 has been added.

All amended rules can be found on the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc.
website @ http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_191r.htm.

"""Freaky Friday"" with Mind's Eye Madness","
""If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn't thinking.""  - George S. Patton, Jr.
 
Keeping with our Mind's Eye Madness week, be sure to check out the Enron Mind's Eye Motorcade 
on Friday, April 27th from 11:30am to 1:00pm at the Big E Cafe.  This art car convoy will spend the day visiting 
Enron-designated stops in the community to promote innovation and creativity.  Mirroring Enron's innovation, 
these artists think about the way things could be and are not limited by the way things are.

Featuring:
Lunch by Escalantes Mexican Grille - choice of beef, chicken or veggie fajitas with trimmings, dessert and a drink for $5.  
Live salsa music will be provided by Tropicrew, featuring Enron's own Ms. Alex Villarreal as the lead singer.  
Non-profit organizations represented will include the March of Dimes, SEARCH and the Lupus Foundation of America.  
Get lunch free if you're dressed ""freaky""!
  
Word of the Day
Zeitgeist \TSYT-guyst; ZYT-guyst\, noun:  The spirit of the time; the general intellectual & moral state or temper characteristic of any period of time.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

"Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia","
Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.""
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.
