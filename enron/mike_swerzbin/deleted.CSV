"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"Super Bowl Square Pools","SWERZ, 
Congratulations go out to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams for earning a trip Super Bowl XXXVI (36). It should be a good game despite what the odds makers are saying, which is St. Louis to win by 14 points. New England keeps surprising and I expect them to make it a closer game than people think. 

I'm writing to tell you about the Super Bowl Square Pools on OFP. Square pools are the 10x10 grid pools that you often see for the Super Bowl. I always run a square pool on OFP during our Super Bowl party. I set up the pool and then people who are OFP members can log in and enter their own picks (even if they aren't at the party) and for everyone else, I create an Alias for them and enter their picks that way. It's super easy and it makes for a fun time and an exciting game, even if your team isn't winning. 

You can start your Square Pool now and see how it works and get things set up. Then if you like the format and want to proceed with the pool, Square Pools cost only $6.95, less than 7 cents per square. Start your square pool now! <http://www.officefootballpool.com/jumpto.cfm?id=155>

I also wanted to tell you about our NCAA Basketball Tournament Pool site called www.tournamentpools.com. I've been working hard to get Tournament Pools up and running for the 2002 season. There's a slick new javascript picksheet and other great improvements. If you liked Tournament Pools last year, you'll love it this year. Look for my announcement next week saying that Tournament Pools is open. 

I hope you have a great Super Bowl and if you don't run a Square Pool I hope to see you for basketball at TournamentPools.com. 

Good luck!

John

"Defense wins championships. Can you?","  <http://games.espn.go.com/st_fflpc/01/email/img/fflpcmail_header.gif>	
	Invitations to the NFL playoff party weren't mailed out until the final game, but now 12 teams are focused on winning a championship. Who could have predicted the surprising run to the playoffs by New England, Pittsburgh and Chicago? If you're saying ""I could have,"" then consider this your invitation to: 

Fantasy Football Playoff Challenge <http://ts.go.com/bk?bs=1&bj=3031&bu=11231579&bt=8773> 
It has been said that defense wins championships, and looking at the teams that had the best defensive numbers (right), the stats don't lie. So now it's up to you: 

* Do you go with history and select players from a stingy cold-weather team such as Chicago, Pittsburgh or Green Bay?
* Or noting that St. Louis is on carpet the rest of the way, do you think offense with members of the ""greatest show on turf""? 
The choice is up to you when you play ESPN.com's

Peter Swartz Joins EPIS as Vice President of Development

 
West Linn, Oregon, January 16, 2002 - EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORA? Electric Market Model, announced that Peter J. Swartz has joined EPIS as Vice President of Development, with responsibility for the development of market modeling software as well as forecasting products and services. 
 
Mr. Swartz, 51, previously was the senior model developer for Northwest Power Planning Council. The Power Planning Council is a four-state planning agency that oversees the regional energy and fish and wildlife interests in coordination with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). As the principal author of the Council's power system planning and decision analysis models, he spearheaded the application of these tools to issues concerning resource economics and reliability in the Northwest power system, including the treatment of planning under uncertainty. Mr. Swartz has pioneered analytical models to examine the tradeoffs between system operation policy and effects on fish and wildlife constraints. 
 
""EPIS has grown significantly over the last three years. Our success in large measure is to due to timely development of modeling capabilities, and we are committed to continuing to meet our clients' energy forecasting needs for 2002 and beyond,"" said Warren Winter, EPIS President. ""We are pleased that an individual with Peter Swartz's experience is joining our management team. Mr. Swartz has more than 20 years of experience in power system modeling and analysis and will be a great asset to our continued growth and success."" 
 
""Not only does he bring strong model development capabilities, he also brings a wealth of background in energy policy and extensive analysis on energy issues, including the bulk power markets,"" Winter said.
 
Mr. Swartz also has provided consulting services to the water industry, developing water supply planning models for use in the analysis of supply, transmission, and conservation alternatives. Prior to 1982, he spent three years at Portland General Electric (PGE) in financial and resource planning.  Also, has taught management science and statistics at the School of Business Oregon State University. 
 
Swartz earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Oregon State University in 1976, and he earned an MBA with high honors in 1977 with emphasis in management science and operations research. 
 
EPIS, Inc., based in West Linn, Oregon (near Portland), provides information on electric-energy prices and market value by applying fundamental economic principles to the emerging competitive energy market. The company is the developer of the AURORA electric market model, uses AURORA to produce market forecasts, and supports clients who use the model to forecast and analyze the energy marketplace. AURORA is used by major North American electric-energy providers, utilities, consultants, and agency and planning groups.
