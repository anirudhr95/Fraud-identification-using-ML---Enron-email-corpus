   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN                                                 
                                                                                
   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE.""                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO   
TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                    
   AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: ""IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME     
BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS.""                    
   AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS
IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -   
PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE
TRADING EXPERIENCE.                                                             
   GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED.                                (CONT)
   ""WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE     
STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING,"" DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS 
ON FEB. 28.                                                                     
   THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA    
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE.                                             
   WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE 
THEN? NOTHING.                                                                  
   ""THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL',"" SAID STANFORD    
ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL    
REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY  
SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE.                                                
   ""MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE  
ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD
HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES,"" SAID 
WOLAK.                                                                          
                                                                          (CONT)
   ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE
HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW  
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND   
THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER
AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES.                                                        
   REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME,  
BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING
CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK.                                       
   BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE     
CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO 
SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO.

This structure is from Caslebridge, who are independent consultants and work with various clients to hedge their exposure. They have not told me who the client is (it is not PacifiCorp)..I think we can make a good guess.

At this time, all we would like to know is that we would consider and price such a structure. If yes, then we would like to give them an indicative no. by Wed morning.

At this time the factors 1,000 and 10 are arbitrary.

Please let me know.

Thanks,

Sanjeev

"RE: Valuation Overview","The market last week for the flat MC was about $31: that difference would be 9.50 = $2,654,02 nominal for the increased mws.  The loss of the delivery value is about $.75/MWh- (about $2.3 million nominal).  The loss of the option is probably about $1 million.   Overall, you did a very job I think its worth $1.5 million- if you go by the numbers its 0.

Subject:	Valuation Overview


MWHRs =  4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours

The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs

I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50).  This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation.  As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership.  If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.

Dick:

You may recall in the early part of May that we agreed as to the form of two (2) certificates which must accompany every financial transaction executed between Enron North America Corp. and EWEB.  The reasons are to (i) verify that either of Bert Dunn or Scott Spettel are still authorized (on the Trade Date) to execute trades under our ISDA Master Agreement and to (ii) insure that EWEB followed its policy of having the transaction reviewed by its Power Risk Management Committee (a copy of the trade confirmation must be reviewed by your committee as per your policy).

Kimberly Hundl will be forwarding certificates for the Transaction (Trade Date: 6/12/01) which we request be executed by Randy L. Berggren, General Manager/Secretary.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance.

Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain  at great length, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the  basin's cheap electricity and water.   Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of  late. Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from  Sunday, they are skidding into the summer air-conditioning season  desperately short of power. In the last year, much of their  salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose monstrous dams are  the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America.  All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia,  utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help  save California - but at a staggering price. Charging whatever  California's dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this  narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind of Kuwait along  the Columbia.  With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the  emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel  generators to make still more power and paying Wall Street-style  wages to electricity traders - while making sure that their  electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America. Just  north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utility  luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks  to 1.6 million customers.  Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of  ambivalence and may well be short-lived. A severe drought is already  hurting farmers across the region. If it continues, utilities along  the river will have to buy power and may be punished by the same  market forces that gave them a windfall.  ""This is not nice money,"" said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who  heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. ""It is  something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can  run their air-conditioners.""  Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia  Basin.  North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly  owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as  much money last year than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local  customers, the utility last year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid  its two top power traders $285,000 each, an astonishing income in a  county where per capita income is less than $25,000 a year. The  utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear their children  might be kidnapped.   The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility  District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were  ""huge"" and ""obscene."" But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added,  ""We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our  customer owners.""  Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that  also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more money  maximizing the market. It had a record $88.8 million in profits last  year - more than double its best previous year.  Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000  retail customers, is using its windfall to help build a $70 million  fiber optic network for local residents. It has also bought 20  diesel generators to guard against power shortages and, if possible,  exploit the power gold-rush. The utility estimates that those  generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming year.  Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought  insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for  electricity, when, as now, local needs exceed generating capacity in  the river. Power rates in Grant and Chelan Counties are about  one-fifth as much as in New York City.  Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea  of giving a share of its profits to its customers.   ""How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so  many people are paying more for electricity?"" asked Lon Topaz,  director of resource management for the utility. ""It would be lousy  politics.""  An Upside-Down Economy    The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin  has combined with California's deregulation mess to further distort  the energy market. Drought has not only helped increase the price at  which electricity can be sold on the spot market - 10 to 20 times as  much as last year's price - it has strengthened a compelling  bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every megawatt not purchased  and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long- term prices  that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south to  California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings  and a long-distance bonanza.  As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap  hydropower has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are  being paid up to $440 an acre not to farm.   Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion  this year by not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoahave earned profits that delight Wall  Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by  reselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a  cheap long-term contract.  Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a  few dollars from the power crunch. AvistaUtilities has announced that it will pay its  customers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do  not use, if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last  year's level.   For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from  California's electricity crisis have been secured in British  Columbia. A number of private American utilities have also benefited  from California's troubles.   BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the  Columbia and Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history  of the province to exceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in  Canadian currency ($712 million in United States currency).

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI

Subject:	My mother's service

Mike and Helen,
Thanks very much for attending my mother's service.  Sydney and I are sorry
we did not get to spend more time with you during my time in Portland.  I
will make sure to contact you next time I am coming into town.  I have
enclosed a residency newsletter I sent out to all of the faculty and
resident's summarizing my eulogy to my mother.  I thought it would be useful
as an educational tool as we all unfortunately have to go through this at
some point.  Please feel free to share it with whomever you wish.  One of
the things I have learned the most through all of this is the importance of
sharing.  Take care.

I want to thank everyone who has written to me via mail or E-mail regarding
the recent death of my mother.  This has been a growth experience for me.
Although I am emotionally devastated, I have learned a tremendous amount
about life in the last few weeks and months.  Since this topic is one we all
must face at some time in our lives, I thought sharing some of this would be
helpful for myself and also for those of you who have either faced it in the
past or will in the future.  It is really a tribute to my mother (a former
schoolteacher), as this was her last lesson for me.  The following is a
summary of my eulogy to her at her memorial service 4/18/01.

What I Learned:  Reflections on my Mother's Life

	1.	True Love:  My mother and I had a volatile relationship
during part of my life.  Like many people, I was very self-centered during
my late teens and most of my twenties.  I did well in my professional life,
but I was not very giving in my relationships (either girlfriends or
family).  My mother was not shy to point out her disappointment with these
behaviors and we had many heated discussions during that time period.  I
have noticed that many friends have had volatile relationships with their
closest parent.  I have learned that true love is about passion for the
other person.  One cannot be silent when you believe changes need to be
made.  Some of the hard times draw you even closer later in life.
Ultimately, my mother was right.  I am very proud of my 30s and grateful
that she was able to witness my maturation as a person.

	2.	Grief:  Of course, I have learned a lot about grief.  Grief
is 90% about you.  In the last few days of her life, there were many tears.
Almost all were mine.  My mother had accepted her fate and had a strong
Christian faith.  She was primarily worried about the effect her death would
have on my sister and I.  The vacant spot in your heart and life cannot be
measured.  It will be a wound that cannot heal as you progress in your life
and cannot directly share it with your loved one.  It will come in waves
triggered by various thoughts and activities, as if it was a neurologic
disorder.  All I can say as comfort to those who have not experienced it is
this:  When the unthinkable happens and you lose what you cannot bear to
consider losing, your life is permanently changed.  However, not all of the
changes will be towards the abyss of permanent melancholy that you assume
will occur.  There will be growth and understanding.  There will be
spiritual and emotional opportunity.  Friends and family will step up to the
plate for you.  (More on this later).

	3.	Role Models:  Like most young boys, my idols as a child were
the typical sport stars, people who did larger than life things that I had
never met.  I tried to pursue the usual goals of the young American male.  I
wanted to be physically attractive, well rounded and intelligent, and
economically prosperous.  I wanted to ""have it all"".  As I grow older, my
definition for ""having it all"" has changed.  My father is an incredible man.
He lost his left arm at the shoulder in a hunting accident age twelve.
Despite this, he did everything a person with two arms could do, and
sometimes even better.  My friends looked at him as an incredible
inspiration.  I did not pay as much attention to my mother's attributes.
She was simply an incredible giving person.  The unfortunates, the lonely,
the downtrodden never went unnoticed by my mother.  She cultivated friends
and family like a good farmer cultivates crops.  The rewards of this became
obvious to me as I spent more time with her in the last few years.  People
visited her constantly.  People called about her constantly.  People did
things for her constantly.  People prayed for her and loved her constantly.
I never would have thought that as I approach 40, my most important role
model would be a frail woman who spent a lot of time in a wheel chair.  I
will never be the same after going through this with her.  For that, I will
always be grateful.


	4.	Glass Half Full Person:  My favorite quote from my mother is
""I am having a good day"".  This was what I always heard when I would phone
her to check on her which I did daily the last year.  For my mom, seeing a
nice arrangement of flowers, visiting with a relative or neighbor, these
were the things that made life grand.  As one gets busier and busier, I
think one tends to become a glass half empty person more and more.
Accomplishments just lead to more deadlines.  The focus is on what you don't
have rather than what you have.  Perspective can become fatally altered.  I
notice the flowers more, the kindness I see more, the sights and smells of
the world more, and appreciate the life I have built more rather than
focusing on the life I want to build.  This is probably the most important
lesson my mother taught me.

	5.	Caregivers:  As a person in the medical profession, I
witness care giving every day.  However, until you have participated in it
yourself, particularly with a loved one, you have not really lived.  The
intimacy you get with the person who you make meals for, wash for, and help
with ADLs is not describable.  You develop little rituals that you look
forward to as much as the person you do it for.  It takes a special type of
person to do this kind of work full-time.  Those moments with my mother will
sustain me the rest of my life no matter what happens to me.

	6.	Priorities:  We all think everything we do is the most
important thing on this planet.  Going through this, I realize that nothing
is more important in your life than your family.  Dr. Krupski said it best
when I came into his office in tears several times needing to go home to be
with my mother this last year.  He said ""Ten years from now, you will not
remember what paper you wrote, what operation you did, what talk you gave.
But, you will always remember and treasure the time with your mother.  Go
home.""  He was right, and I will never be able to repay him for the ability
to spend time with her.

	7.	Friendships/Neighbors:  As I stated, my mother was excellent
at cultivating these relationships.  It is really not rocket science, it
just requires your time and being open.  I was amazed that she kept contact
with 8 friends from high school (50 years) till the day of her death.  They
would get together regularly.  In the modern world, this is very unusual.
Perhaps it is because we all have distorted priorities.  In addition, she
had a very tight bond with her neighbors.  I remember we had all of the
neighbor kids playing at our house regularly because of the size of our
yard.  One day a boy broke his leg (clearly an immediate lawsuit today), but
that did not stop the neighborhood kids.  My mother was on hospice months
before she officially went on the list.  It was the neighborhood hospice.
They would drive her places, fix her plumbing, and mow her lawn, all for
free.  They would bring food, come visit, and share their lives with her.
It was an incredible thing to see.

	8.	Courage:  My mother spent the last 30 months of her life
with an hematocrit between 15 and 25.  She rarely complained.  She mustered
the strength in the last year to attend my sister's wedding, her high school
reunion, and shop for holidays and decorate the house for Christmas.  She
went to restaurants with friends.  A month before her death she went to
lunch with me twice, went on a trip to a local waterfall, and went shopping
at the local center.  She did all of this with a hematocrit of 17.
Seventeen is the number I will always remember when I am tired and wishing I
could sleep but the life and job I have requires my time.

	9.	Acceptance:  How does one learn to live with the
unthinkable?  Well, I have come to understand many things.  The worst part
of chronic illness is watching your loved one slowly fade over time.
However, they are so miserable at the end that having them leave is more
acceptable.  My mother had a tremendous faith, and I know she is in a better
place.  I have changed as a person based on the above reflections, and I
understand that part of her will always live on through my life and actions.
It is a time of great emotion, but also great opportunity.  Many friends and
family come out to support you, which allow a chance to reunite past
relationships with others.  My sister and I have become very close through
all of this.  That would make my mother proud and happy.   Memorial services
and the like are all about celebration of life.  There are tears, but most
of remembrance is the honor of sharing the person's life.  I know my mother
more now than I ever did.  I have 2.5 hours of her on video to share with my
future children so they can know her too.  I am the product of two
schoolteachers.  They were awesome teachers and not surprisingly awesome
parents.  Much of what we are comes from those that raised us.  I did not
understand that before.  I do now.

Thanks for allowing me to share some of my mother's life with you.
Hopefully it will be as meaningful to you reading it as it was to me writing
it.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON [mailto:IMCEANOTES-Enron+20Announcements_Corp_Enron+40ENRON@ENRON.com]  On Behalf Of Ken Lay - Chairman & CEO@ENRON
Sent:	Thursday, September 13, 2001 8:09 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Nice car photos.   Hey I have been thinking about some sponsors here are some ideas:  Krispy Kreme Donuts (national growing donut chain--everybody loves them), Calpine Energy, Duke Energy, New York Times (they deliver locally through-out the US), Starbucks Coffee (out of Seattle),  Southwest Airlines, Champion Sportswear, Columbia Sportswear, America OnLine, Home Depot,and I could come up with some more.  Do you like any of these for a last name??  John Krispy Kreme???  
 
Sounds like things are going well for you -- give me a call sometime.

Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;

We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)

Subject:	BEAVER CREEK TRAVEL

The Enron Americas Management Offsite has been scheduled for August 16-19, 2001 in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
Charter aircraft will be available between Houston and Eagle/Vail Airport - flight itinerary is listed below:
Thursday, August 16 - 5:00pm departure from Enron Aviation at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (arriving in Eagle/Vail at approximately 6:00pm)
Sunday, August 19 - 9:00am departure from Eagle/Vail Airport (arriving at Enron Aviation at approximately 12:00pm)

You have the option of flying into Houston and taking this charter flight or you can work with your local travel agent to obtain personal travel into either Denver International or Eagle/Vail.  Enron will provide ground transportation from both airports.  Flights into Eagle/Vail are very limited during the summer months.  Driving time from Denver to Beaver Creek is approximately 2 1/2 hours and approximately 35 minutes from Eagle/Vail to Beaver Creek.

Once travel has been confirmed, please provide me with a copy of your itinerary so I can secure the proper ground transportation.

Please let me know if I can be of assistance or if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Hey,

I'd like to know if I could buy you a beer sometime and pick your brain on how things work in the NW term trading world.  I'm one of the NW mid-marketers now (4 of us total) and I'd like to know in advance how to best work with you, add value, and not be a pain in your ass.  Let me know if this is OK.  You pick the time & place.

Thanks!

Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;

We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)
