Accounting Regulations

Western peak power prices dropped for Saturday delivery amid waning weekend
loads, while light load prices were mostly higher due to the inclusion of
the all-day Sunday piece.  A Monday/Tuesday package will be scheduled on
Friday so WSCC traders can take off Martin Luther King Day on Monday.  While
MLK Day is not a recognized NERC holiday, it is a national holiday and a
NYMEX Exchange holiday.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures fell Thursday despite a
firmer physical market, reportedly due to bearish fundamentals and some
technical selling.  February and March Hub gas both closed at 2.254$/mmBtu,
down 14 cents and 10.9 cents, respectively.  In the political arena, White
House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer finally admitted Enron executives did meet
with President Bush and other Administration officials during the drafting
of their energy policy, but insisted that the company did not receive any
favorable treatment.  The letter to Ken Lay from Enron executive Sherron
Watkins has raised the possibility that the beleaguered company may be
forced to write-off an additional $1.3 billion in reported earnings.  The
cash in question was generated by financial subsidiaries Condor and Raptor,
which were wholly backed by Enron stock. In the wake of Andersen's auditing
debacle, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he intends to form a new committee
responsible for oversight and regulation of the accounting industry.  In the
""too little, too late"" category, Enron's Board of Directors voted Thursday
to fire Andersen as the company's auditors.  No word yet on who the lucky
new accountants will be.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 3.75$/MWh for
Saturday delivery, while trading in a tight range between 18 and 19$/MWh.
Light load goods, however, were flat to slightly higher, with confirmed
transactions between 17 and 18.  Some traders seemed a little surprised by
the very narrow spread between light and heavy load prices, but as one
trader pointed out, ""It's cold up here, especially for the off peak hours,
and throw in the all-day Sunday and it's no wonder why the spreads are
merging.""  There was also talk Thursday that some parties were concerned
over falling snowpack levels in the Northwest.  According to the NWRFC's
January mid-month water supply forecast, April through September runoff at
The Dalles fell to 91% of normal, down from 93% of normal on the previous
report.  Nonetheless, the report suggested the Pacific Northwest is still
likely to have much healthier water levels in 2002 than last year.  2001 was
one of the region's driest winters ever, and the January mid-month report
for that year showed April through September flows at The Dalles were only
expected to be 68% of normal.  Additionally snow-pillow data for the
Columbia Basin in Canada showed that snowpack levels are holding at
above-normal levels.  Current flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were also
holding their ground, coming in at 100 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.

Peak electricity prices fell while off-peak prices stayed steady in the
Golden State on Thursday, mainly on the usual lighter loads for a weekend
package.  ""More heating demand from the colder weekend weather forecast also
kept light load up, and there was some generation back today, cutting into
heavy load prices"" said one California trader.  In political news, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali ruled on Thursday that he would allow
the CPUC to present arguments supporting why they should participate in the
PG&E reorganization process.  The CPUC will have until February 13 to
present their case in support of the plan they favor.  In San Francisco
Superior Court, the California Attorney General requested that Enron be held
in contempt for not turning over documents in the state's case alleging
price gouging by energy companies during last year's energy crisis.  On the
generation front, gas-fired Alamitos #3 (320 MW) returned to service on
Thursday, while sister unit #5 (480 MW) was operating at 290 MW.  Northern
hydro Big Creek Project (1,020 MW) was producing at 68% capacity, derated by
330 MW compared to just 50 MW on Wednesday.  Finally, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW)
powered up to 185 MW on its way back from a planned maintenance outage that
began January 4.  Temperatures were expected to linger below normal through
Monday of the new week.  Highs were predicted to reach the 50s at mid-state
and the low-60s at southern load centers, with corresponding lows
anticipated in the 30s and 40s, respectively.  The latest six-to-ten called
for continued below-normal conditions from January 23 to 27.

Lower weekend loads helped to depress peak power prices in the Southwest on
Thursday.  Heavy load energy costs at Palo Verde fell by as much as
4.5$/MWh, while light load goods rose by an average of 1.25$/MWh.  Off-peak
power at PV traded between 17 and 21$/MWh, with most deals going through
from 17 to 19$/MWh.  There was little to report in the way of unit news in
the desert region on Thursday.  There was some talk of a transformer check
being conducted at Palo Verde #3 (1,270 MW), but output at the nuke was
unaffected.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
Southwest was forecast to average 113% of normal through January 24, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures
in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 23 through 27.

Despite a slump in natural gas values, cooler forecasts for Friday pushed
peak power prices mostly higher on Thursday across the Eastern Interconnect.
""NYMEX opened lower, promptly taking the wind out of the sails of forwards
trading,"" said one Midwestern power dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures softened on Thursday, with the February contract down 14 cents to
close at 2.254$/mmBtu.  March lost 10.9 cents to also end at 2.254$/MWh

Peak power prices gained a whopping 20 cents on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic
due to little change in the weather or generation landscape.  Western PJM
goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.65 and 23.8$/MWh.
Traders said February edged up about a dime, with deals done around 24.9 to
24.95$/MWh.  After the usual early morning surge and a few bumps in the late
morning, LMPs averaged 20.34$/MWh through 16:00 EST.  Forecasts for Friday
called for highs in the low-40s and lows near freezing.  Little change was
predicted through Monday, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
above-normal temperatures from January 23 to 27.

Spot electricity prices edged up on Thursday in the Midwest on a day
characterized by high volatility, fluctuating gas values, and uncertainty
about weather forecasts.  ""There were some big players pushing Cinergy
prices around today, and the near-term tanked, so I'm not too excited about
the perceived strength in the dailies,"" commented one discouraged trader.
Into Cinergy pieces for Friday delivery were bought and sold between 21.3
and 22.85$/MWh, with prices falling lower as the day progressed.  The
February contract opened near 23$/MWh, settled to 22.2$/MWh just before
NYMEX opened, and was trading between 21.25 and 21.4$/MWh by early
afternoon, according to sources.  In unit news, LaSalle (1,144 MW) was in
cold shutdown Thursday, and expected to be off-line through mid-February for
a refueling outage.  Friday temperatures were expected to be lower, with
highs forecast in the low to mid-30s and lows in the mid-20s.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from January 23 to
27.

As natural gas values on Thursday lost most of the gains posted on Wednesday
and other fundamentals remained mostly unchanged, heavy load energy costs
stayed steady in the Southeast.  Into Entergy goods traded between 19.5 and
22.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard from 20.5 to 21.25$/MWh.  Traders
said February deals were going through at around 20$/MWh.  Into TVA
day-ahead pieces saw action from 21 to 22.5$/MWh.  The mercury was expected
to slip about four degrees on Friday in SERC, with high temperatures
settling in the low-50s.  The forecast looked steady there through Monday,
and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January
23 to 27.

"HP Driver","Mike,

Here's the URL to the driver. I sent it via instant message but that probably won't help since you need to get the url to your house. So I figure you could forward this email to your email account that you can access from home like yahoo or hotmail or whatever you use at home.

Hope this helps.

First off Happy New Year's to all you guys!   Most of you already have
the 
dates and other information about our Whistler trip this year but I
wanted 
to make sure you had all the details for this year's extravaganza.   For

those of you that went last year you know the drill.  I pay for 
accomodations and meals (and we will eat at some nice places!).  You 
arrange your own transportation, lift tickets and ski rental (all of
which 
can be done on arrival and cost under 150 US dollars).

Here are the details:

Dates:   Jan 31st thru Feb. 3

I arrive thursday Jan. 31 12:50 pm on horizon air. (then taking the 2:30

star express to whistler, arrive 4:30)

Shuttle to whistler:  Whistler star express:  phone #(604) 266-5386

Condo: Woodrun  3bd/2bath with den.  (near chateau whistler)  The
shuttle 
will drop you off at or near woodrun.

Lift tickets and ski rental:   All can be taken care of on arrival at 
nearby Chateau Whistler.

If I left anything out let me know.

Look forward to a great trip,


Ed

"2001 Management Conference","
During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

"Valuation Overview","
MWHRs =  4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours

The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs

I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50).  This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation.  As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership.  If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.

Duncan Demands Immunity

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. were mostly steady for
Thursday delivery amid weather forecasts calling for a slight increase in
temperatures and an abundance of Northwest hydropower.  However,
temperatures were expected to drop again beginning on Friday, which offered
sellers a glimmer of hope for a stronger end to the month.  Additionally,
the latest six-to-ten from the National Weather Service showed the Western
U.S. blanketed in below-normal temperatures from January 29 through February
2.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures were mixed in moderate trade Wednesday, with
the fronts pushed down to new lows by mostly mild U.S. weather forecasts,
and again later in the session by a bearish AGA weekly inventory report.
February Hub gas fell 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu after reaching a new
contract low of 2.04$/mmBtu shortly after the AGA report was released.
March also hit a new low of 2.06$/mmBtu, but settled 2.9 cents lower than a
day ago at 2.089$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report indicated that 124 bcf
were taken out of storage last week, below industry estimates and the
five-year average drop of 182 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.405
tcf, 1.036 tcf, or 76% above last year.  Of the 124 bcf withdrawn, 21 were
taken out of the Western Consuming Region.  Total Western inventories stood
at 379 bcf, or 75 percent full.  Inventories for the same week a year ago
were 241 bcf, and have averaged 280 bcf over the past five years.  Now for
your daily dose of Enron.  David Duncan, the fired Andersen partner who was
the lead auditor for Enron Corp, challenged Congress by stating via his
attorney that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to
testify at a hearing scheduled for Thursday unless he was granted immunity.
Committee chairman Rep. Billy Tauzin said that no immunity would be granted
Duncan without consent of the Justice Department.  ""I will not provide
immunity to anyone without consent of the Justice Department who is doing a
criminal investigation.  I have not received such a green light to this
date, as to whether or not they change their mind I can't say,"" said Tauzin
on CNN.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were unchanged Wednesday as
abundant hydro supplies satiated regional heating demand.  ""It's still cold,
but we've got plenty of hydro to cushion us,"" said one Northwest utility
trader.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised higher Wednesday,
coming in at 110 kcfs Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  There was
no major unit news to report, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down for
generator repairs.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
region was forecast to average 136% of normal through January 30, with the
greatest demand expected early next week.

Amid a healthy grid and concerns that weather could be slightly warmer than
expected later in the week, electricity prices were mostly steady in the
Golden State on Wednesday.  ""We're chasing gas and watching the extended
forecast pretty closely, but otherwise it is a boring day,"" said one Western
marketer. The heavy load product at SP15 changed hands between 22.55 and
24.4$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 23.25$/MWh, while light load
pieces were bought and sold from 16.5 to 18.85$/MWh.  In political news, the
CPUC approved two measures necessary for SCE's return to solvency.  SCE will
be allowed to raise $1.5 billion in bridge financing, which when combined
with $4 billion cash on hand, will permit the bankrupt utility to pay off
its creditors by the end of the first quarter.  Secondly, SCE will raise
consumer rates to cover the bridge financing.  ""SCE needs to pay off their
qualifying facilities, but it will be interesting to see whether they are
actually willing and able to pay the CalPX for power purchased on the
exchange, and for power purchased on their behalf by CAISO last winter.  I'm
a little skeptical, but I hope they do,"" commented one market analyst.  In
unit news, gas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was off the grid on Wednesday
for planned maintenance.  Highs for Thursday were predicted in the mid-60s
in Los Angeles, and low-50s at mid-state load centers.  Temperatures were
expected to remain below normal in California through Sunday.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 29 to
February 2.

On forecasts calling for slight warming, peak power prices in the Southwest
traded slightly lower for Thursday delivery.  ""Our overnight lows are
supposed to climb back into the 40s beginning tonight, and that's much more
tolerable than the 30s,"" said one Phoenix-based trader.  Heavy load energy
at Palo Verde traded anywhere from 19 to 23$/MWh, though most deals went
through around the 22$/MWh mark.  There was no significant unit news to
report on Wednesday, but there was some talk of an upcoming maintenance
outage.  Sources indicated that Navajo #2 (750 MW) was coming down for
planned maintenance on February 2, and returning on February 25.

Hope of an upswing in the spot electricity market was firmly squashed
Wednesday as a bearish AGA report, incredibly warm January temperatures, and
soft gas values plagued the market, sending day-ahead power prices mostly
lower across the Eastern Interconnect.  Temperatures were expected anywhere
from 11 to 20 degrees above normal in the East on Thursday.  The AGA weekly
inventory report listed a total draw of 124 bcf, a number well below
industry estimates of around 145 bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures,
already low, sunk further on the disappointing news coupled with the warm
weather pattern.  February shed 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu, while the
March contract fell 2.9 cents to end at 2.089$/mmBtu.  Both months reached
new contract lows during the day, before rebounding somewhat prior to the
close.

Heavy load energy costs slipped lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.
""The dailies were pretty lame today, with the extremely mild temperatures
and the soft real-time prices.  Prices were a little erratic early, on a
possible unit outage, but demand is too weak for even a large curtailment to
matter,"" summed up one PJM trader.  Market players remained uncertain as to
which unit shut Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery traded
between 21.5 and 21.9$/MWh, while the February contract lost about 15 cents,
trading mostly around 23.5$/MWh.  LMPs remained low on Wednesday, after
showing a little strength around 10:00 EST, and averaging 20.68$/MWh through
15:00 EST.  Daytime highs were expected to hit 62 degrees in D.C. on
Thursday, while other PJM load centers also expected warm temperatures, with
highs in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten projected no relief in
sight, as above-normal temperatures were forecast from January 29 to
February 2.

Amid mild weather conditions and little else, peak electricity prices shed
value in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods opened at the day's
highest levels, and fell off steadily through the session, trading between
15.5 and 17.9$/MWh.  According to traders, February was actively traded,
bouncing between 19.4 and 19.55$/MWh.  Temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-50s on Thursday across ECAR.  The latest six-to-ten called
for above-normal temperatures from January 29 to February 2.

Day-ahead power prices tanked in the Southeast on Wednesday, weighed down by
bearish fundamentals.  Into Entergy deals were done between 17.1 and
18$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard near 17.75$/MWh.  February saw
action from 18.3 to 18.4$/MWh.  High temperatures across SERC were expected
in the spring-like upper-60s to low-70s on Thursday.  Texas power prices
bucked the trend on Wednesday, rising on cooler weather for Thursday.  The
most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures in the
Southeast from January 29 to February 2.

Western Hangover

With one notable exception, peak power prices slackened across the WSCC on
the first day of trading in the New Year.  Mild coastal and southwestern
weather kept a lid on demand at the region's major load centers, while
generation output levels in California strengthened significantly in
comparison to the holiday doldrums.  Combined with the fact that spot gas
prices were weaker than they were on the last full day of trading, peak
power prices fell anywhere from .25 to 3$/MWh across the West on Wednesday.
The only anomaly in the West was the Central Rockies, where prices for peak
goods shot up by as much as 12.75$/MWh, with high end trades going through
at 37$/MWh.  ""I'm not sure why it was so expensive here today,"" responded
one trader to a request for an explanation. ""Temperatures are really cold,
and unit outages are up, but other than that, I wouldn't be able to guess.""
The low temperature in Denver was a frosty six degrees on Wednesday, though
the five-day forecast called for temperatures to warm into near normal
territory by Sunday.  Meanwhile, on NYMEX, Henry Hub natural gas futures
fell on Wednesday.  The February contract dropped 10.5 cents to settle at
2.465$/mmBtu, while March slid 11.7 cents to close at 2.443$/mmBtu.

Across the Northwest, peak power prices for Thursday delivery softened from
1.5 to 3$/MWh.  Peak goods changed hands from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Temperatures
were mild on Wednesday, and well above average west of the Cascades, with
highs in the low 50s and partly cloudy skies.  East of the Cascades
temperatures were near freezing but still slightly above normal, while the
five-day forecast called for temperatures to heat up slightly through
Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures near to above normal
from January 8 to 12.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised
significantly upward over the long holiday weekend, coming in at 105 kcfs
Thursday and Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday, and
105 kcfs Tuesday through next Wednesday.  In unit news, Montana coal-burner
Colstrip #4 (740 MW) returned to the grid Tuesday night after making
unplanned repairs.

As weather too warm to trigger heating demand lingered in the Golden State
and generation became healthier, power prices for Thursday delivery weakened
in the first trading session of 2002.  In a generally quiet, low-offer day,
market players reported trading at NP15 was especially light, as a soft spot
market in the Northwest pulled it down.  ""The market had a cautious tenor
today, but besides the new calendar there wasn't a particular reason for
 it,"" mentioned one undisturbed California marketer.  Peak goods at SP15
changed hands between 26.5 and 28.5$/MWh, with most deals done from 27 to
27.5$/MWh.  Light load pieces traded in a wider range from 19.5 to
23.25$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 18$/MWh.  A proposal for
more than 31 miles of new transmission lines in southern California, running
between the SCE grid and San Diego Gas & Electric, moved forward on
Wednesday.  The new capacity is needed to meet San Diego's swift-approaching
projected power shortfall.  Currently, the U.S. Department of the Interior
is studying the environmental effects of the proposal.  In unit news, a bevy
of returning units boosted generation in California.  Gas-fired Alamitos #6
(480 MW), Alamitos #4 (320 MW), El Segundo #3 (337 MW), and Morro Bay #4
(336 MW) were back in service on December 29, December 31, and the latter
two on January 1, respectively.  New additions to the out of service column
included Moss Landing #7 (739 MW) and Morro Bay #3 (337 MW).  Finally,
Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) tripped off-line December 29, but was back
the following day.  Forecasts for Thursday called for above-normal
temperatures in the middle and northern sections of California, with highs
in the 57-59 degree range and lows around 50 degrees.  Los Angeles expected
highs in the mid-60s.  Little change was expected through the weekend across
the entire state, and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from January 8 to 12.

Despite a rash of unit outages, prices for peak goods weakened by up to
2$/MWh in the Southwest on milder weather and falling demand.  Peak pieces
at Palo Verde traded from 25 to 27.5$/MWh.  Temperatures across the region
hovered around normal, though the five-day forecast predicted some slight
cooling through Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to
remain near to above normal from January 8 through 12.  On the unit front,
coal unit Mohave #2 (442 MW) tripped off-line on December 27 for unplanned
repairs.  There was no ETR available.  Fellow coal-combustor Cholla #4 (375
MW) came off-line early January 1 for undisclosed reasons and was expected
back in a few days, while Navajo #3 (750 MW) came off line on New Year's Eve
with a tube leak but was back on-line by New Year's Day.  Meanwhile,
Coronado #1 (365 MW) continued to have problems with its main transformer.
It has been off the grid since December 22.

As temperatures plunged and loads climbed in the new year, peak power prices
settled higher across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday, breaking the
30$/MWh mark in some places.  ""Trading was brisk today, with pricing
following weather and loads up.   Loads were higher than expected, I think,
and some units are still down from the holidays,"" said one Eastern trader.
""There was a run-up at the end of trading,"" commented a Midwestern dealer.
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on Wednesday, with the
front-month contract losing 10.5 cents to close at 2.465$/mmBtu.  March fell
a similar 11.7 cents to end at 2.443$/mmBtu.

Facing a key unit outage and temperatures well below freezing, heavy load
energy costs strengthened in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM
goods changed hands between 28.85 and 31$/MWh, up from Monday trading in the
low 28s.  According to traders, the bulk of transactions went through around
29.5$/MWh, with offers at 31$/MWh accepted late.  In unit news, traders
thought nuke Salem #2 (1,106 MW), down since the weekend, remained out of
service on Wednesday, despite hopes it would be back on-line Tuesday.
However, no official confirmation of the outage was available.  LMPs
fluctuated sharply and remained above 30$/MWh for the first part of the
morning, but were averaging 26.47$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures
were expected to stay in the mid-30s on Thursday, with lows in the mid-20s.
Little change was forecast for Friday, and slight warming, with highs
breaking into the 40s, was predicted for the weekend.  The latest six-to-ten
called for normal temperatures from January 8 to 12.

Peak electricity prices rose in the Midwest on Wednesday, as colder weather
drove energy demand up on the first business day after the New Year's
holiday.  Into Cinergy pieces were bought and sold between 24 and 30.5$/MWh,
with the high end reached late in the session, but traders were uncertain as
to why prices jumped.  ""New Year, new load,"" summed up one happy Midwestern
seller.  Cold weather was expected to keep the Midwest firmly locked in its
grip on Thursday, with highs forecast right at freezing and lows in the
mid-teens.  The mercury was expected to rise into the high-30s Saturday.
The most current six-to-ten from the NWS predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures, with normal forecasts for southern ECAR, from January 8 to 12.

After weeks in the price doldrums, day-ahead electricity prices in the
Southeast finally showed some strength on Wednesday, pulled up by the
bullish fundamental of cold weather.  Into Entergy deals were done between
23.25 and 25.25$/MWh, gaining almost 2$/MWh on the high end.  Contrary to
the norm, spot power prices Into TVA carried a premium to the Entergy hub,
with goods trading between 24 and 26$/MWh.  Forecasts called for snow and
cold temperatures across much of the deep South.  Overnight lows in the
mid-20s and highs in the mid-30s were expected on Thursday, with
temperatures expected to remain well below normal through the weekend.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal and below-normal temperatures from
January 8 to 12.

Subject:	Luscar/USW update

There have been few developments since the start of the strike so it has
been a while since the last update.  Below is the current status:

     The Alberta Labour Relations Board (ALRB) has determined that pickets
     on the plant gates as occurred during the first 3 days of the strike
     and disrupted TransAlta operations are not allowed.
     Luscar is fulfilling their responsibility to supply fuel to
     TransAlta's Sundance and Keephills plants through the implementation
     of their contingency plans.
     Inventories used to supply the units when mine operations are slowed
     remain at adequate levels.
     The most significant impact to date has been to coal blending
     operations.  Suboptimum blending results in derates.  Challenges in
     this area are expected to continue for the duration of the strike and
     likely several days thereafter.
     Risks to plant and mine operations from the strike exist.  Luscar and
     TransAlta have plans in place to address these risks but there are no
     guarantees that output will be maintained at current levels.  It is
     our objective to adapt operations to minimize the impact of these
     events which are outside of our control and to meet our PPA
     obligations as much of the time as possible.

We understand Luscar and the USW will be meeting later today.

Should the situation change as a result of the meeting or any other
consequential developments I will send another e-mail within a few hours,
including over the weekend.

Regards,
Jim

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

Gasping Over Gas

As EMR staff and Western traders trickled into work from their extended
holidays, peak prices in the Western energy markets backed down slightly
from levels seen on Wednesday.  ""Well, weather's not atplay here - there's a
lot of water for the hydro, it's cool, but not cold, and it's the holidays,""
explained one Northwest marketer. ""There's just not a lot of motivation to
buy or sell,"" he added.  Off-peak power firmed up slightly across the entire
WSCC, likely due to increased overnight heating demand, some analysts
ventured.  Other likely contributors to Thursday's softening of WSCC peak
power prices were high gas inventories and lower spot prices, according to
players.  The AGA's weekly natural gas inventory report was released on
Thursday, showing a draw of 81 bcf - a bigger draw than the industry
expectations of 65 to 70 bcf, but well below last year's draw of 175 bcf and
the historical average of 145 bcf.  Combined with the fact that current U.S.
stocks stand at 2.980 tcf, or 90% of capacity, Thursday's natural gas news
wreaked havoc on NYMEX futures prices.  The January contract expired
Thursday after plummeting 35.6 cents to settle at 2.555$/mmBtu, while the
February contract trailed along, losing 31.8 cents to close at 2.619$/mmBtu.
""I felt like I was on a sinking ship,"" exclaimed one exasperated gas
marketer, ""Everyone was yelling 'Bail, bail, bail!'""  Despite the excitement
in natural gas markets, most energy traders reported another day of thin and
illiquid trading as most businesses and all schools will remain closed until
after the New Year.

Northwest peak power prices for the Sunday-Monday package eased off almost
2$/MWh from levels seen on Wednesday.  Monday peak goods at Mid-Columbia
traded in a tight range from 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  Temperatures in the
Northwest ranged from the upper-40s west of the Cascade Mountains to below
freezing east of the Cascades.  The five-day forecast called for
temperatures across the region to converge on normal as the weekend
progresses into Monday.  The latest six-to-ten called for temperatures to
range from normal to below normal across the region from January 2 through
6.  Flows at Chief Joseph were revised slightly upward, coming in at 90 kcfs
Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs Monday, 55 kcfs New Year's
Day, and 100 kcfs Wednesday through next Thursday.  There was no unit news
to report in the Northwest on Thursday.

Amid near-normal weather forecasts and weak spot gas prices, heavy load
energy costs fell in the Golden State on Thursday, while light load prices
were up on the usual all-day Sunday premium. Sunday-Monday package prices at
SP15 won the pole position on Thursday, with peak goods changing hands
between 25.3 and 27$/MWh, while off-peak power was traded from 18.5 to
25$/MWh.  ""L.A. is supposed to be about 10 degrees warmer than load centers
farther north so weather's probably not a factor, but New Year's loads are
usually higher, particularly in Pasadena with the Rose Bowl and all,""
speculated one California player.  Another added that liquidity was still
affecting the market on Thursday.  Spot natural gas prices at the Southern
California border followed the general trend when they slipped 23 cents,
trading between 2.52 and 2.57$/mmBtu.  In generation news, gas-fired Moss
Landing #6 (739 MW) returned to service on Thursday.  The unit has been down
since December 19 for unplanned maintenance.  Los Medanos (550 MW) was
operating at 125 MW, down from Wednesday's level of 200 MW.  Additionally,
there was an extra 640 MW off-line on Thursday from units with a capacity
less than 250 MW.  On the weather front, the outlook was less than exciting,
with temperatures across the state expected to linger within five degrees of
normal through Monday.  Overnight lows were forecast uniformly in the
mid-40s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal
temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Not even sustained below-normal temperatures could prop up power prices for
peak goods in the Southwest on Thursday against the gas-led tumble that
rattled the WSCC.  Peak goods at Palo Verde traded in a dollar range from 25
to 26$/MWh, a softening of 4$/MWh on the high end.  Temperatures were normal
to below normal across the region, and one couldn't even break a sweat in
Phoenix on Thursday.  The five-day forecast called for temperatures to heat
up on average, but they were still not expected to warm into above-normal
territory.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to remain normal or
below normal through January 6.  Nary a murmur was heard of unit outages in
the region on Thursday.

___________________________________________________________
As natural gas prices dropped considerably and below-normal temperatures
reigned supreme, peak power prices for Friday delivery settled lower across
the Eastern Interconnect.  ""The Jan/Feb contract came off a lot today, but
otherwise there wasn't much interest or liquidity in the market,"" commented
one southern trader.  The AGA's weekly inventory report listed an 81 bcf
draw on Thursday, above most industry forecasts of 65 to 70 bcf.  NYMEX
Henry Hub futures were unable to sustain recent gains, and slipped
substantially.  On its last day of trading, the January contract sunk like a
stone, losing a traumatic 35.6 cents to close at 2.555$/mmBtu.  February
fell an equally depressing 31.8 cents to end at 2.619$/mmBtu.

Despite a new unit outage and continued cold weather, day-ahead electricity
prices edged down in the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday.  According to sources,
Indian Point #2 tripped off-line sometime Wednesday and remained down on
Thursday.  Some traders speculated the unit would be back up Saturday,
December 29.  Western PJM daily goods changed hands between 25.5 and
26.35$/MWh.  ""Someone was buying a lot of power early so prices were strong,
but after that they fell.  There was some West to East congestion which kept
them from dropping too much and the real-time number was also robust,""
summed up one PJM player.  LMPs lingered above 40$/MWh for two hours in the
late morning, but were averaging 25.85$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  The five-day
weather outlook predicted sustained below-normal temperatures through
Monday, with highs uniformly expected in the mid-30s across PJM.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Forecasts for bitterly cold temperatures by the weekend cheered Midwestern
sellers, but despite the good news heavy load energy costs for Friday
delivery slumped on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces traded between 19 and
21.5$/MWh, losing a painful 5.5$/MWh off the high end and 3$/MWh off the
low.  ""Load forecasts for the new week are higher, so we should see some
strength on Friday,"" opined one trader, while another said, ""I think people
will keep the thermostat up and their gas fireplaces crackling over New Year
's.""  No new curtailment information was available on Thursday.  High
temperatures were expected in the low-20s to high-teens by Saturday, with
little change expected through Monday.  The most current six-to-ten
predicted below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Amid much weaker natural gas prices, peak electricity prices tumbled in the
Southeast on Thursday.  Into Entergy deals were done from 21 to 22.5$/MWh,
with the bulk of transactions seen nearer the high end.  Into TVA prices
were heard between 20 and 20.5$/MWh, losing at least 4$/MWh off both ends,
while traders said the hub was very illiquid.  Friday forecasts predicted
slightly below-normal temperatures, with overnight lows in the 28 to 34
degree range.  Substantial cooling was expected by Sunday and Monday, with
lows predicted in the mid-20s across the entire region.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Until further notice please make every effort to have your curves downloaded by 2:15-2:30 Central Time.  As you both know, there are many individuals waiting for the new marks and many decisions to be made on the numbers, so your cooperation in getting us the curves helps us to finalize the numbers in a timely manner.  If you could also stress to your traders the importance of double checking their curves so no mistakes are made and also being extra careful in deal entry that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks,
Stacey

On the Auction Block

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. continued to fall Monday
against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals.  While mild weather
for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline,
lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also
lending a helping hand.  ""I don't know if prices can dip much below current
levels, but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on
the margin, and we could see some single digit prices,"" said one marketer.
Temperatures were forecast to remain at above-normal levels through the
week, with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to
average only 69 percent of normal through January 14, though some cooling
was expected next week.  ""Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the
Northwest and California next week, but temperatures are not expected to
fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand,"" said one
Oregon-based trader, who added, ""And even if temperatures do fall
considerably, abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a
minimum.""  On the political front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said
Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in U.S.
regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of
one-time energy giant Enron Corp.  ""I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on
this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its
obligations under the existing rules,"" said O'Neill of the provisions that
allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron
stock in retirement plans could not.  ""If they did [comply with U.S.
regulations], it suggests that we need rule change.  If, on the contrary, it
turns out that they didn't fully comply with all the rules, we have a
different issue on our hands,"" O'Neill said on NBC.  An auction of Enron's
trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday, though no details had been
released as of this writing.  ""We hear that there are more than the two
original suitors that will be bidding on Enron, which is good news for Enron
traders, but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced, so it may be
a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining
the company,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 2$/MWh on Monday
as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies
healthy.  Light load goods fell by an average of 1.75$/MWh.  ""It was a quiet
day, with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation,"" said
one Northwest utility trader.  There were some rumors that the 484 MW
gas-fired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning, but confirmation
was not available.  ""It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway,"" said one
trader of the possible outage.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
slightly lower than on Friday, despite recent rains, but remained healthy at
85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and 85 kcfs next
Monday.  Weather forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in Portland
and Seattle over the course of the week, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures across the entire region
from January 13 through 17.  ""The six-to-ten offered some longs a glimmer of
hope today, but it's too far off to rely upon, and the current over
abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold
snap,"" hypothesized one market pundit.

With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and
plenty of supply flooding the electricity market, power prices settled lower
across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade.  Players speculated on where
prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out.  However, with
no cold weather on the horizon, most players were pessimistic of a quick
turn-around.  ""Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro.  They
probably won't, but they could,"" commented one California trader.  On-peak
goods at NP15 and SP15 traded mostly flat to each other, between 20.5 and
22.5$/MWh, while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers, with deals
heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh.  Light load transactions were heard mostly
in the 15 to 17$/MWh range.  In generation news, Moss Landing #6 (739 MW)
was operating at 500 MW on Monday.  The Duke unit was derated for planned
maintenance.   Fellow gas-fired generator Haynes #6 (341 MW) was all the way
off-line for planned maintenance, with no official cause or ETR.  However,
the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer.
Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday, with
high temperatures expected in the mild mid-50s to upper-60s. The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures along the coast and
in Northern California, with normal temperatures in the southern interior,
from January 13 to 17.

Unseasonably mild weather, lower spot gas prices and returning generation
were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as
3.5$/MWh, while light load goods shed as much as 4.25$/MWh.  On the unit
front, Four Corners #4 and #5 (750 MW each), San Juan #1 (350 MW), and
Mohave #2 (790 MW) were all back in service Monday morning following
unplanned outages that began last week.  A six-to-ten-day forecast calling
for normal temperatures in Arizona and above-normal temperatures in New
Mexico from January 13 through 17 offered little hope for those looking for
a significant upswing in the market.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 7, 2002 for January 8, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    20.50     1.50    22.00     -4.00

Into TVA        21.00    -0.50    21.50     -4.00
___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer temperatures as the week progresses and a healthy
generation landscape, day-ahead electricity prices mostly softened across
the Eastern Interconnect on Monday.  Into Entergy was the exception,
rallying late when a large buyer entered the market.  NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas prices remained almost unchanged on Monday.  The front-month
contract lost 0.3 cent to end at 2.272$/mmBtu, while March edged down a
nearly identical 0.4 cent to close at 2.261$/mmBtu.

Despite transmission work at several points on the Eastern Interface and
predictions of below-normal temperatures for Tuesday, peak power prices
floated lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM day-ahead goods
changed hands between 25.45 and 26.25$/MWh.  Balance-of-the-week trades were
heard from 24.5 to 25$/MWh, off a little on forecasts for gradually warming
weather this week.  ""There needs to be some sustained cold weather to give
demand and prices a boost,"" said one PJM dealer.  High temperatures were
expected in the upper-30s on Tuesday, before climbing into the upper-40s on
Wednesday and lingering there through Friday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

The story was the same in the Midwest, as weak demand and warmer forecasts
plagued the spot market, sending heavy load energy costs for Tuesday
delivery lower.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 20.5 to 22$/MWh,
sliding 4$/MWh on the high end.  No new outages were reported on Monday.
High temperatures were expected in the 35 to 40 degree range on Tuesday,
while the mercury was expected to climb even more by Wednesday, with highs
forecast to reach into the low-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery posted mixed results in the Southeast
on Monday, as arbitrage between hubs sent the Entergy dailies higher and
left TVA unaffected.  ""Into Entergy prices were driven up late.  I think
some of the bidders were buying in order to sell to Southern today, with
transmission not difficult to come by and that hub at a premium,"" explained
one trader.  The heavy load product Into Entergy saw action from 19 to
25$/MWh, gaining 2$/MWh on the low end and 2.5$/MWh on the high.  Into TVA
goods traded between 21 and 21.5$/MWh.  Traders were also relieved to see
natural gas prices up, albeit incrementally, on Monday.  Market player had
been worried on Friday that prices would fall again on Monday.  Temperatures
were expected to rise into the mid-40s on Tuesday at most major load
centers, with further warming anticipated through Thursday, with highs
expected to reach the spring-like low-60s. The latest six-to-ten called for
normal conditions from January 13 to 17.

Heavy load energy costs in the Western U.S. rose for Monday delivery on
expectations of more weather-related demand at the start of the new week, as
well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out.
Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures
were forecast to dip even further.  Some parties also claimed that a rise in
the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily
electricity market.  ""It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity
market, there was no volatility and no liquidity.  But next week could prove
to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes,"" said one
marketer on Friday.  Following last Monday's auction for a 51 percent
ownership stake in the company's trading arm, Enron Corp. chose to have
Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business.
Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying, but company lawyers said they
will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on
Monday.  The move was designed to restore market confidence in the one-time
gas and electricity marketing giant.  Enron shares were suspended since the
NYSE opened on Friday, pending news on the deal.  Andersen, the accounting
firm for Enron, remains in hot water following news that the firm violated
one of the accounting profession's basic auditing standards by destroying
several Enron documents.  There are still many questions surrounding the
destroyed documents, including who shredded them, when, and exactly why.
The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm,
all for the sake of Enron.  Misery loves company.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as much as 2$/MWh for power
to be delivered on Monday, largely the result of forecasted cooling over the
weekend, which was likely to boost demand early in the new week.  ""We're
going to drop back down to more seasonable temperatures over the weekend,
and that means we'll have more heating to contend with,"" said one Northwest
utility trader.  Light load goods rose by an average of 2.5$/MWh on the
anticipated cooling, and partly due to the inclusion of the all-day Sunday
piece.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained healthy despite a reduction
in runoff, coming in at 60 kcfs Saturday, 50 kcfs Sunday, 95 kcfs Monday,
and 90 kcfs Tuesday through Friday.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) was
back on the grid Friday, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was brought down due to
""generator problems.""  While no official ETR was available, sources were
hearing a January 18 return, ""at the earliest.""  Reports indicated that
Wyoming-based Dave Johnston #3 (230 MW) has been down since January 8, and
the return date, which currently sits at January 15, has been pushed back
several times.  Finally, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was scheduled to shut on
Saturday, January 12 for tube leak repairs.  While no official ETR was
available, conventional wisdom suggests a 48 to 72-hour turnaround.  Weather
forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip to
normal levels over the weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting a near-blanketing of below-normal temperatures across the entire
region from January 17 to 21.

Despite little change in temperature forecasts for Monday and weaker gas
prices at the Socal border, electricity prices for the Sunday/Monday package
settled higher in the Golden State on Friday.  ""Sunday's inclusion usually
brings light load prices up, but light load ran up more than I expected at
the end, maybe on the number of units off for the weekend and the colder
weather anticipated in the new week,"" said one California trader.  On-peak
power at SP15 traded between 21.5 and 23$/MWh, while off-peak deals were
done from 14.5 all the way up to 19.5$/MWh, gaining more than 4$/MWh on the
high end.  In unit news, Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid on
Friday, as did larger gas unit Pittsburg #7 (682 MW), down since January 3
for unplanned maintenance.  Off-and-on Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) came down
for unplanned maintenance, while Encina #5 (332 MW) exited for planned
repairs.  Forecasts at mid-state load centers called for temperatures in the
42 to 57 degree range on Monday, about five degrees above normal for this
time of year.  Los Angeles was anticipating highs around 67 degrees and
overnight lows at 51 degrees on Monday, right at seasonal levels.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to
21.

Day-ahead prices in the Southwest made their typical rise for Sunday/Monday
power, but some parties were surprised by the amount of strength seen.
""Prices were up quite a bit, which surprised me since spot gas was off
slightly today and while temperatures are expected to drop, they should
still remain above normal levels,"" said one Phoenix-based player.  Peak
power at Palo Verde traded from 20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done at the 21$/MWh mark.  Light load goods ranged from 15 to 18.25$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 13$/MWh.  In unit news,
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (365 MW) remained off line Friday, but was
expected to ramp up to two thirds load on Saturday, where it will remain for
more repairs until ramping up to full power on January 16.  While most
regional temperatures were expected to remain above or just at normal levels
into the new week, the latest six-to-ten was predicting a round of
below-normal temperatures for the entire desert region from January 17 to
21.

With cooler weather forecast for Monday and a stronger gas market for much
of the day, spot electricity prices traded mostly higher and in tighter
ranges on Friday across the Eastern Interconnect.  However, power prices for
February delivery were mostly down, reflecting a still predominantly bearish
and cautious market.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures had posted gains
on Friday, mainly on weekend risk.  The front-month contract edged up 1.9
cents to close at 2.204$/mmBtu, while March picked up an incremental 0.8
cent to end at 2.203$/mmBtu.

An upturn in the gas market, cooler temperatures for the new week, and
stronger real-time prices for much of the day all helped boost peak power
prices for Monday delivery in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday.  Western PJM goods
were bought and sold between 24.55 and 25.1$/MWh, gaining about 2$/MWh at
both ends.  February deals were heard from 25.4 to 25.5$/MWh.  LMPs spent an
hour or more above 37$/MWh on three occasions during the day on Friday,
bringing the average up to 25.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, a substantial gain
over Thursday's average.  Traders thought an unexpected outage at one of the
Salem units (1,106 MW) was the most likely culprit sending the dailies and
real-time prices higher.  Sources also thought the unit would remain down
into the early part of the new week.  Forecasts for Monday called for
temperatures to remain above normal but below Friday's readings.  Highs were
expected in the 47 to 50 degree range, but lows were expected to dip into
the low-30s, prompting expectations of more overnight heating load in the
new week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal conditions
from January 17 to 21.

Heavy load electricity prices traded mostly steady and in a narrower range
to a day ago in the Midwest on Friday.  Into Cinergy pieces changed hands
between 16.5 and 18.15$/MWh.  Although the high end was significantly lower,
the bulk of transactions were seen near Thursday's levels.  The February
contract continued to bleed on Friday, with trades heard between 20.9 and
21.3$/MWh.  ""February is hopefully near the low end of where it can trade,
but the physical market is weak, so it all depends on how weather forecasts
and gas do next week,"" commented one forwards trader.  In unit news,
Michigan-based Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was operating at 90% on Friday, joining
fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) in coasting down towards mid-month refueling
outages.  Temperatures were expected to remain above normal on Monday, with
highs reaching the low-40s and lows mostly in the upper-20s.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to 21.

Bouyed up by gas gains, peak power prices were steady to slightly higher on
Friday in the Southeast.  No new outages were reported on Friday.
Temperatures were expected to cool somewhat in the new week, but ample
generation kept prices in check.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday were expected
in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten called for below-normal
temperatures from January 17 to 21.

"FW: IEP FERC/ISO: FERC Mtg Agenda for 12/19","In addition to the summary below, the agenda has the West-wide cap case on the agenda.


FERC has posted its agenda.  It is available at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\CA\CA121901.000.TXT.

Here comes the Federal Regulatory Santa Claus?  FERC's agenda for its 12/19
meeting is incredibly ambitious and appears to have queued up a large swath
of high profile cases.  To speculate based upon the current, end-of-the-year
agenda, it appears that there will be orders regarding RTOs at center stage,
with a twist of congestion mitigation thrown in (?).  Interconnection issues
also come up, including the CA dockets.  There's also an order coming in the
California docket, but its not that clear whether this addresses the gross
load issue, outage coordination, the must-offer requirement, or some other
facet of the ""market mitigation"" docket.  RMR contract updates and the
various protests also come up for consideration.

The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

If you request a copy of the full annual report from the plan administrator, these two statements and accompanying notes will be included as part of that report.

You also have the legally protected right to examine the annual report at the main office of the plan (Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX  77002-7311) and at the U.S. Department of Labor in Washington, D.C., or to obtain a copy from the U.S. Department of Labor upon payment of copying costs.

"Adjusted L/R Balance","Mike,

I placed the adjusted L/R Balance on the Enronwest site.  It is under the ""Staff/Kourtney Nelson"".  There are two links:  

1)  ""Adj L_R"" is the same data/format from the weekly strategy meeting. 
2)  ""New Gen 2001_2002"" link has all of the supply side info that is used to calculate the L/R balance
	-Please note the Data Flag column, a value of ""3"" indicates the project was cancelled, on hold, etc and is not included in the calc.  

Both of these sheets are interactive Excel spreadsheets and thus you can play around with the data as you please.  Also, James Bruce is working to get his gen report on the web.  That will help with your access to information on new gen.

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback,

"Team 4 Congratulatory Lunch at Rock Bottom","The stars have aligned to designate Wednesday, October 24, as the day to have our lunch.

Let's meet at Rock Bottom at 11:45 (or we could get all radical and actually leave together from the floor at 11:40) for the celebration.

We could probably figure out how many Kcalories we all burned by riding during September and dedicate ourselves to replacing them at a single sitting!

See you there.





Great work, team--we took the ""total number of trips"" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26


Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.

__________________________________________________________
And the Winner Is???

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose slightly Tuesday on
revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few
days.  The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest, where
heating demand was forecast to climb to above-normal levels by week's end.
""They've got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and that's what limited the
upside, but that also means there's less power available from the north, so
our prices went up a little as well,"" said one Southern California utility
trader.  Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder
weather draws closer, but most expected the upside to be limited due to the
abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices.  In other industry
news, Weil Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, reported
Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron
Corp.'s energy trading business.  Weil plans to announce the winning bidder
at its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S.
bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday.  Meanwhile, the court
is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to
Texas.  While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential, it was
reported that Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg were among the suitors, though a
third financial institution that had previously expressed interest, J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co., declined to submit a bid by Monday's night's deadline.
British company BP Plc. also said it may be interested in the operations,
and had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's
assets, including some back office functions and some IT assets.  Enron's
lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but
rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of 1$/MWh for
Wednesday delivery.  Cooler weather forecasts were near-universally blamed
for the rising dailies, though most players conceded that healthy river
flows would limit the upside.  ""The colder weather is a small blessing for
sellers, but also for the region as a whole.  The recent warm weather has
caused some snowmelt, something few people want to see until the spring, and
the lower temperatures should put a stop to that,"" said one Northwest
trader.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was
expected to average 64 percent of normal Wednesday, and then rise to a peak
of 120 percent of normal by Sunday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
little changed from a day ago, coming in at 85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and back up to 85 kcfs next Monday and Tuesday.

Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather, day-ahead electricity
prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday.  Gains were
modest, on the order of a dollar everywhere.  Traders cited colder
temperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gas
prices as the main factors leading prices higher.  ""Balance of the month is
trading at a premium to the dailies, which is usually a sign of coming
strength,"" said one trader.  Peak goods at NP15 were bought and sold between
22.25 and 23.75$/MWh, while the off-peak products changed hands from 16.5 to
18$/MWh.  In political news, the FERC judge for the California refund case
said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July 12, and submit his
proposal to FERC by early August.  The state accuses energy companies of
overcharging during last year's energy crisis, an allegation the companies
deny.  On a less litigious note, last month FERC asked the CAISO to come up
with a detailed plan for reforming the state's energy market.  The proposal
could be unveiled as early as late Tuesday, and would include elements of
the much-admired PJM RTO.  It would also emphasize a way to reduce
intra-zonal congestion and include a plan for a day-ahead market, although
on a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX.  There were no
dramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday.  Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) and Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid, while hydro unit Big
Creek Project (1,020 MW) was operating at 970 MW.  On the weather front,
Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mid-50s and low-60s
at mid-state load centers, and in the high-60s in the south.  Little change
was expected in temperatures through Saturday.  The most current six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than a
dollar on Tuesday, with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spot
gas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon.  Peak power at Palo Verde
ranged from 20 to 22$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen right in the
middle at 21$/MWh.  Balance-of-January contracts were heard trading at about
a $2/MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday, likely in reaction to the cooler
forecasts.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) was in the process of
restarting Tuesday afternoon, as expected.  Four Corners #5 (750 MW) was
operating at 550 MW Tuesday due to air-preheater problems, with no available
ETR to full.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desert
region to climb from its current level of 50 percent of normal, to just
above normal over the coming weekend, but the latest six-to-ten was still
calling for a mix of normal and above-normal temperatures from January 14
through 18.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer weather on Wednesday and little else changed in
market fundamentals, heavy load energy costs drifted lower across the
Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""The EIA revised the Q1 electricity demand
estimate downwards today.  That shouldn't really affect the dailies, but
sometimes its what people think will happen that matters more than what
actually does happen,"" suggested one market analyst, who added that he
thought weather was a greater factor in the dip in day-ahead prices.  NYMEX
Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher on Tuesday.  February gained
0.9 cents to close at 2.281$/mmBtu, while the March contract picked up 2.4
cents to end at 2.285$/mmBtu.

Day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday amid
warm weather forecasts for the rest of this week and next, and on light
demand in the region.  Western PJM goods changed hands in a narrow range
between 24.2 and 24.85$/MWh.  According to traders, prices were low out of
the gate, climbed to the peak within an hour, and ended the day back down at
the low end.  No new outage information was available on Tuesday.  High
temperatures were expected in the 45 to 51 degree range in PJM on Wednesday,
and forecast to stay within five degrees of there through Saturday.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Temperatures in the Midwest were expected to climb to their highest level of
the week on Wednesday, bringing peak power prices down by about a dollar on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Wednesday delivery traded between 19.55
and 21.25$/MWh, dropping 0.75 and 0.95$/MWh off the high and low ends,
respectively.  The February contract gained some support Tuesday morning,
opening strong and climbing to 23.15$/MWh before dropping back down to
22.25$/MWh.  ""Prior to the open, gas looked strong, and people were buying
February to cover their shorts, but gas came off fast and that was the end
of that,"" said one trader of the ill-fated early rally and fizzle.
Temperatures at most ECAR load centers were expected to hit the upper-40s on
Wednesday, with corresponding lows in the mid-30s.  Thursday forecasts
called for temperatures to stay near that level, while Friday was expected
to cool five to seven degrees.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

As natural gas weakness continued to concern Southeastern traders, and
forecasts called for significantly warmer temperatures for the rest of the
week, heavy load electricity prices softened in the Southeast on Tuesday.
Into Entergy deals were done from 19 to 20$/MWh, while Into TVA deals for
Wednesday delivery were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  TVA prices
reached their low late in the day.  In unit news, sources said one of the
Scherer coal units (832, 833, 844, and 844 MW) was off-line but expected
back on Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Gas Pains

With the latest weather forecasts revising temperatures upward from the
Arctic blast predicted on Tuesday and hydropower in the Northwest remaining
strong, peak power prices for Friday and Saturday delivery generally fell
modestly across the WSCC.  ""There's simply no strength in the market right
now, with flows and generation as strong as they are, temperatures so high
and gas prices so low,"" explained one hair-pulling marketer.  Meanwhile,
market pundits across the region were on the edges of their seats awaiting
news from Weil, Gotshal & Manges on who cast the winning bid for Enron's
energy trading business, once considered the jewel in the ex-giant's crown.
However, the announcement had not been made as of this writing.  The law
firm was scheduled to announce the winning bid on Thursday from their New
York offices.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub futures lost ground for the
second day in a row despite the AGA's bullish natural gas inventory report
released Wednesday.  The front month contract lost 4.3 cents to close at
2.185$/mmBtu, while the March contract fell 3.7 cents to close at
2.195$/mmBtu.  Both contracts were trading higher early, but came down in
late trading under a rash of short selling.  ""Everyone's trying to keep
their positions very short on this one, with all the uncertainty around,""
explained one analyst.  ""Prices could fall to as low as 2$/mmBtu before
long.""

Heavy load power at Mid-Columbia was the cheapest in the West on Thursday,
with deals ranging from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high
end.  ""Now that the brunt of the cold front is going to miss us, the bottom
is falling out of the market again,"" ventured one stoic player.  The
five-day forecast called for temperatures to remain above normal through
Saturday, followed by cooling to near-normal temperatures through January
14.  The latest six-to-ten called for cooling to below normal temperatures
from January 16 to 20.  Flows at Chief Joseph remained healthy, and were
even revised slightly upward for the coming week on forecasts of rain and
snow showers, with Friday coming in at 65 kcfs, Saturday at 60 kcfs, Sunday
at 50 kcfs, Monday coming up to 95 kcfs, and 90 kcfs through next Thursday.
There were no new unit outages to report on with certainty on Thursday, but
there were murmurings in the Northwest that Colstrip #3 (686 MW) had joined
its sister unit #4 (700 MW) off-line. No confirmation was available.

As weather forecasts continued to call for near-normal temperatures through
Monday and spot gas prices at the Socal border stayed steady, power prices
for the Friday/Saturday package softened in the Golden State on Thursday.
Peak power at SP15 traded between 18 and 20.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done in the 19s, while the off-peak product changed hands from 14 to 15.25.
In political news, California's Attorney General filed a civil suit against
PG&E Corp on Thursday, seeking $600 million to $4 billion in damages.  The
state alleged PG&E Corp. received substantial, unwarranted cash flows over
the past 4 years from its subsidiary PG&E, and finally did nothing to
prevent the utility from falling into bankruptcy last year.  For their part,
PG&E Corp said CPUC auditors had thoroughly reviewed their transactions with
their subsidiary and found nothing fraudulent.  On the generation front,
Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was almost at full power on Thursday, operating at
690 MW.  Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) exited the grid for planned maintenance.
Friday forecasts called for high temperatures to the reach the mid-50s in
Sacramento, the low-60s in the Bay area, and the low-70s at southern load
centers.  Little change was seen in the forecast through Monday of the new
week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
January 16 to 20.

The Southwest, locked in the grips of a heat wave pushing temperatures into
the 70s in Phoenix, posted moderate decreases in peak power prices for the
Friday-Saturday package.  Goods at Palo Verde changed hands from 17 to
19.75$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high end.  Many marketers reported
very light trading at other hubs in the region, such as Four Corners and
Mona.  The five-day forecast put temperatures in above-normal territory
through January 14 in the desert region, with some cooling outside of the
desert on Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted continuing near- to
slightly below-normal temperatures from January 16 through 20.  In unit
news, coal juggernaut Four Corners #5 (750 MW), which was scheduled for a
maintenance outage on January 15, tripped off-line late Wednesday with a
condenser tube leak.  Plant operators decided that no attempt would be made
to repair the leak and place the unit back on-line before the scheduled
maintenance, so the ETR will be near March 14, 2002.  Fellow coal-smoker
Coronado #1 (365 MW) missed its January 9 ETR yesterday.  The new estimated
date of return is sometime in the evening on January 11.

___________________________________________________________
As temperatures continued their climb and gas held steady, day-ahead and
near-term contract electricity prices declined again across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  ""Peak power at most hubs was solidly in the
teens, which wasn't surprising with fundamentals so bearish,"" commented one
unfazed southeastern trader.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were up
for much of the day, but fell late and ended down.  The front-month contract
settled 4.3 cents lower to close at 2.185$/mmBtu, while March shed 3.7 cents
to end at 2.195$/mmBtu.

Amid mild spring-like temperatures and much lower real-time prices, heavy
load energy costs slipped further on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic.  Western
PJM goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.75 and 23.05$/MWh,
shedding 0.55$/MWh on the high end, but firming up a quarter on the low.  In
unit news, traders said Conemaugh #2 (850 MW) probably returned to service
on Thursday, while a Keystone unit (850 MW) was off-line and expected to
remain that way through the weekend.  Temperatures were expected to edge
slightly lower on Friday, with highs in the 49 to 52 degree range.  A
further 5 degree decline was expected on Saturday, and temperatures were
expected to remain there through the first day of the new week.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 16 to
20.

Peak power prices slumped for the third day in a row in the Midwest on
Thursday as weak weather-related demand and healthy generation kept hopes of
an upside in the daily market unrealized.  Into Cinergy day-ahead deals were
done between 15.75 and 19.75$/MWh, with most trades below the 19$/MWh mark.
Balance of January was heard trading around 20.5$/MWh, and the February
contract saw action from 21.05 to 21.25.  While forecasts called for about 5
degrees of cooling on Friday, the outlook through Monday predicted
temperatures to remain well above normal for this time of year, with lows in
the upper-20s to low-30s and highs in the upper-30s to mid-40s.  The latest
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

As the mercury rose and spot gas made incremental gains, heavy load
electricity prices in the Southeast continued to fall on Thursday.  Into
Entergy goods were bought and sold between 15 and 19$/MWh, losing a painful
4$/MWh off both ends.  Into TVA prices also took a hit on Thursday, with
daily trades heard between 16.5 and 18.25$/MWh.  No new outages were
reported for the SERC region.  Temperatures were expected to reach highs in
the upper-50s and low-60s on Friday, with overnight lows mostly in the
upper-40s.  Highs were expected to cool off into the mid-50s for the weekend
and first day of the new week.  The latest six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"Northwest Reserves","We currently have $21.4 million in reserve for potential Northwest refunds.  $10 million currently sits in the LTCA book and $11.4 currently sits in the LTNW book.  During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate
?	SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy


California Senate & SoCal's Fate 
With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:

?	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.
?	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.
?	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.  
?	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.
?	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.  
?	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)

It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov. Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are ""optimistic"" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.

Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Inside Edison 
There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.

SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.  

SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

The Boxer Rebellion

On Tuesday, Western peak power prices dipped slightly amid abundant
Northwest hydro flows, sluggish holiday demand and slightly lower spot gas
prices.  ""A lot of schools and businesses are beginning to close for the
holidays, and loads should remain at lackluster levels until after the start
of the new year,"" said one marketer.  Spot gas prices fell about 10 cents on
all of the Western pipelines.  At the Southern California border, spot gas
reportedly traded between 2.63 to 2.68$/mmBtu, down from Monday's range of
2.74 to 2.79$/mmBtu.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts also slid Tuesday on
ample storage, but the decline was likely limited by colder weather
forecasts for much of the eastern half of the United States.  January Hub
gas slipped 2.9 cents to close at 2.657$/mmBtu, while February lost 4.9
cents to end at 2.712$/mmBtu.  After Wednesday's inventory report is
released, with most players expecting a 20 to 70-bcf draw, the AGA will
delay its next two reports due to the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
The next report will be released at 14:00 EST on Thursday, December 27, and
then again on Thursday, January 3, 2002.  In the political arena, Democratic
Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine proposed legislation on Tuesday
requiring more diversification in pension plans to protect other U.S.
workers from the retirement savings fiasco that crippled many Enron Corp.
employees.  The two senators also called for a thorough investigation of the
events leading up to Enron's collapse.  According to Reuters, Boxer and
Corzine said about 67% of the assets in Enron 401(k) retirement plans were
invested in Enron stock, and they proposed limiting the investment an
employee can have in any one stock in their 401(k) to 20 percent.  ""No one
who gives investment advice would ever recommend someone being invested at
67%,"" said Corzine at a news conference.  Their proposal also called for
limiting the time an employer can force an employee to hold a matching
employer stock contribution in the employee's individual account plan to 90
days.  That proposal would increase the tax liability of the employer when
matching contributions to an employees 401(k) are made in company stock.
With Congress preparing to recess soon for the year, Boxer and Corzine's
bill will likely have to wait until next year to progress, and the bill does
not at this point have Republican support.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 75 cents on
Wednesday, as abundant hydro flows and lower demand placed downward pressure
on the market.  Light load goods gained as much as 5$/MWh on the low end
from a day ago, which was misleading since most Monday transactions took
place on the upper end of the spectrum.  ""There was not much of a range out
there today, and consequently not as much activity,"" said one
Washington-based trader.  Recent rains have continued to spawn hearty river
flows in the hydro-heavy region, but water watchers warned that if the
soaking continues, rising flows could begin cutting into maximum generation.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed from a day ago, coming
in at 95 kcfs Wednesday, 90 kcfs Thursday and Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, 75 kcfs Christmas Eve, and 65 kcfs on Christmas Day.  Weather
forecasts for the region's major load centers called for near-normal
temperatures into the weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting above-normal conditions for most of the Northwest from December
24 to 28.

Amid softer spot natural gas prices at the SoCal border and weaker demand,
spot electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load
goods at NP15 traded between 30.5 and 33$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done
above 32$/MWh.  Light load pieces saw action from 25 to 26.5$/MWh, with
odd-lot deals heard as high as 27.25$/MWh.  Light load goods at SP15 earned
the dubious honor of the steepest price declines in the West on Tuesday,
falling more than 4$/MWh at both ends.  Traders said lighter loads were the
likely culprits, but were generally perplexed by the extent of the
softening.  In other news, SCE reported it would request permission from the
CPUC to increase the rates its customers pay by 18% in 2003.  The utility
emphasized that the rate hike was based solely on operating costs, and not
related to debt repayment negotiations.  SCE said upgrades on its
electricity system are necessary in the near future and employee health care
costs have also dramatically increased.  On the unit front, San Onofre #3
(1,080 MW) was derated by 100 MW on Tuesday, though no cause could be
determined.  Gas-fired Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to service, and El
Segundo #4 (335 MW) was operating at 170 MW.  Calpine's Sutter Plants (546
MW) was completely off-line, down from 235 MW a day ago.  Los Angeles was
expecting high temperatures in the mid-60s through Saturday, while most
other major load centers were expecting highs in the low-to-mid-50s.  The
most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures across
California from December 24 to 28.

Lower spot gas prices and weaker demand led to a general softening in the
day-ahead electricity market in the Southwest on Tuesday.  Heavy load energy
at Palo Verde ranged between 29 and 30.75$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades as
low as 27.25$/MWh and as high as 33$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (790 MW)
was expected to return on Wednesday or Thursday following tube leak repairs
that began on Saturday, though most thought Wednesday to be a wee bit
optimistic.  Further to the north, Colorado-based Craig #1 (428 MW) was
given an ETR of ""sometime on Wednesday,"" but most participants were
reportedly not scheduling it in until Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for normal temperatures in Arizona and below-normal
temperatures throughout much of New Mexico from December 24 through 28.

___________________________________________________________
Amid light trading and continued warm weather, peak power prices mostly
strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""People are
closing their positions for the year, which gave the dailies a little boost,
but I expect it to get even quieter this week as people start leaving ahead
of the holiday,"" said one seasoned dealer.  Forecasts for Wednesday called
for temperatures to be about five degrees cooler across the East.  The rest
of the week was expected to linger one to five degrees above seasonal
levels.  The AGA announced the Christmas and New Year holidays would delay
the weekly report by one day, pushing its release back to Thursday, December
27 and January 3 at 14:00 EST.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures settled
lower on Tuesday.  The front-month contract lost 2.9 cents to end the day at
2.657$/mmBtu, while February slipped 4.9 cents to close at 2.712$/mmBtu.

As additional megawatts continued to come back on-line in the Mid-Atlantic
on Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were heard in a very tight range and
about 50 cents lower than a day ago.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 23.9 and 24.05$/MWh.  After the usual early morning spike, LMPs
spent most of the day between 15 and 20$/MWh, and averaged 16.47$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  ""Balance-of-the-month remains pretty soft, along with
everything else, but I bought a piece at 25.25$/MWh today,"" commented one
rueful PJM trader.  Deals for the Jan/Feb contract were heard around
31.5$/MWh on Tuesday.  High temperatures for Wednesday were expected in the
crisp 47 to 52 degree range at the major Mid-Atlantic load centers.  Little
change was seen in the forecasts through Saturday.  The latest six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

Forecasts for slightly cooler weather on Wednesday sent the corresponding
load projections a little higher, boosting day-ahead electricity prices in
the Midwest on Tuesday.  Into Cinergy deals were done from 18.5 to 21$/MWh,
gaining a 2.35$/MWh on the high end and a less robust 60 cents on the low.
In generation news, traders reported on Monday that nuclear unit Fermi #2
(1,085 MW) was exiting a fall refueling outage and ramping up to full power.
Temperatures were only expected to reach a high of 43 degrees on Wednesday,
with forecasts for the rest of the week calling for little change. Overnight
lows were projected to be at or just below freezing.  The most current
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

Amid stronger spot natural gas prices, peak power prices in the Southeast on
Tuesday strengthened, despite mild weather and holiday-related loads.  Into
Entergy pieces were bought and sold from 20.5 to 21.75$/MWh, firming up
1.25$/MWh on the high end and 2.5$/MWh on the low.  Into TVA transactions
were heard between 18.5 and 19.5$/MWh.  ""Weather is the ringleader of the
SERC circus right now,"" joked one Southern trader.  Nonetheless, the mercury
was forecast to dip on Wednesday, with highs only expected in the 54 to 59
degree range.  Little change was predicted through Saturday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Hungry for Heat

Heavy load energy costs in the West received a boost on Monday, compliments
of forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures, increased generation
curtailments, and slightly higher natural gas prices.  The long-awaited
colder weather was likely to strengthen spot electricity prices over the
coming days, but opinions varied as to the extent and duration of the
forecasted cooling.  ""The cold is finally coming here, and temperatures
should remain below normal for at least a week,"" said one Northwest trader,
who added, ""I'm sure the dailies will react to this bullish weather pattern,
but there's so much gas in storage and water in the rivers that prices may
not rise as much as some people are anticipating.""  NYMEX Henry Hub futures
contracts rose Monday amid reported short covering, but the gains were said
to be limited by moderate weather forecasts for the eastern U.S., and
continued concerns surrounding high gas storage levels.  February Hub gas
rose 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.7 cents to
settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.  In other industry news, attorneys for bankrupt Enron
Corp. said Monday they were delaying the release of details about Enron's
trading unit sale to the Swiss financial institution UBS Warburg until 23:00
EST Monday.  Enron and its attorneys would not comment on the reason for the
delay.  Patience is a virtue?isn't it?

Peak power prices in the Northwest were on the rise for Tuesday delivery, a
trend many players believed would continue through much of the week.  A
round of colder weather was expected to increase heating demand in the
region over the next several days.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the region was expected to average 110 percent of normal
through January 21, while the most recent six-to-ten-day forecast from the
National Weather Service was predicting that below-normal temperatures would
continue blanketing the Northwest through January 24.  Healthy flows at
regional hydro generating units, however, had some parties convinced that
the cold would come and go without incident, and that the upside for daily
prices would therefore be limited.  Flows for Chief Joseph on the Columbia
River came in at 95 kcfs through Thursday, 90 kcfs Friday, 60 kcfs Saturday,
50 kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW)
was reportedly still off line Monday for tube leak repairs, though sources
were expecting the Wyoming-based unit to return later Monday evening.
Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330 MW) came down Sunday for tube leak repairs
expected to last from 48 to 72 hours.

With temperatures slated to remain near to slightly above normal through
Friday, day-ahead peak power in the Golden State firmed up for Tuesday
delivery.  Marketers cited an increase in off-line generation as the primary
factor in the price increase.  Peak goods at SP-15 were the premium fare on
Monday, with pieces changing hands between 23 and 26.25$/MWh.  The latest
six-to-ten called for temperatures to hover around normal from January 20 to
24. In the news, the California Chamber of Commerce and the California
Business Roundtable proposed eliminating the Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority and the Electricity Oversight Board, and to consolidate
the duties of the Public Utilities Commission, the Energy Commission, the
Department of Conservation, and the energy division of the California
Department of Water Resources.  Chamber of Commerce President Allan
Zaremberg cited the many overlapping duties of these government entities as
creating competition and conflicts of interest, with the end result of
inflating the state's electricity costs, while two of the entities are of
dubious worth anyhow.  The newly-formed Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority has not done anything besides drain state resources
since its inception in August, and the Electricity Oversight Board has
shrunk to a single board member in the absence of its primary duty - to
oversee the now-defunct California Power Exchange.  Legislators vowed to
untangle the web of conflict, redundancy, and inefficiency carefully, to
avoid causing an even bigger mess than the one they aim to repair.
Generation had a turbulent weekend, with small-unit outages climbing by
almost 1,700 MW since Friday, and Encina #4 (303 MW) joining sister unit
Encina #5 (332 MW) in off-line status.

As temperatures in the Southwest were poised to dip through the week, spot
electricity prices reacted in kind, gaining as much as 4$/MWh for Tuesday
delivery.  Slightly higher natural gas prices were also said to be adding
strength to the dailies.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 22 to
26$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen between 23.75 and 24$/MWh.
Weather Derivatives projected that heating demand in the desert region would
average 112 percent of normal through January 21, peaking out at 123 percent
of normal on January 18.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was also
calling for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest through January
24.  ""Our daytime highs are expected to fall into the mid 60s, and our
overnight lows into the mid 40s.  I know that doesn't sound all that cold,
but thin-blooded Southwesterners will undoubtedly be turning on the heat,""
said one Phoenix-based trader.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) ramped up
to two thirds capacity over the weekend, and was scheduled to hit full power
sometime on Tuesday.

hubs strengthening in the face of covert unit outages.  In the north,
temperatures as much as 15 degrees above normal sucked the life out of the
market, while southern hubs, despite above-normal temperatures, surged
upward amid what some marketers assumed were unreported unit outages.  NYMEX
gas futures gained some ground Monday on short covering, but mild weather
and massive inventory levels limited the upside. The February Henry Hub
contract gained 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March rose 3.7
cents to settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery at Western PJM changed hands from 22
to 23.65$/MWh, losing ground from Friday's 24.55 to 25.1$/MWh trades.
Marketers blamed forecasts calling for temperatures as high as 12 degrees
above normal at least through Friday, with rain showers likely Monday and
Tuesday. The latest six-to-ten likewise forecasted temperatures to remain
firmly entrenched in above-normal territory from January 20 through 24. Many
described Monday's market environment as a ""state of confusion, with a lack
of clear direction and thin, illiquid trading"" among players.  Just before
06:30 on Monday, LMPs spiked to 46$/MWh, and rose again right before 07:00
to just under 40$/MWh, but during peak hours prices did not reach more than
about 32$/MWh.  The average for LMPs on Monday was 22.51$/MWh through 14:00.
In unit news, nuclear unit Salem (1105 MW) was reportedly off-line Monday
for undisclosed reasons, with an ETR of Tuesday, January 15.

Into Cinergy day-ahead prices were mostly flat to Friday's peak power
prices, with goods for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 16 to 18.5$/MWh.
This represented a loss of 50 cents on the low end and a gain of 35 cents on
the high.  Temperatures remained unseasonably warm on Monday, with the
five-day forecast calling for temperatures to swing from up to 8 degrees
above normal on Tuesday to 3 degrees below normal on Thursday.  ""There's
still hope that the week could see some strength,"" dreamed one player in
reference to the favorable forecast.  The latest six-to-ten called for a
return to normalcy from January 20 through 24.  There were no new unit
outages to report in ECAR on Monday, but it was reported that Palisades #1
(789 MW) could join the grid again as soon as January 18.

The blast of cold air that brushed across the Midwest last week was
breathing its last icy breaths in the Southeast on Monday, with temperatures
predicted to pick up and remain above normal through Friday.  Into Entergy
goods traded at a 0.6 to 3.5$/MWh premium from Friday's trades, with peak
power for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 18 to 22.5$/MWh.  Some
marketers insisted that weather had nothing to do with it.  ""Obviously,
there are some units off, or prices wouldn't have come up like they did,""
commented one contented seller, ""it's just that nobody's going to know which
ones for a couple of days.""  The latest six-to-ten predicted Southeastern
temperatures would remain firmly above normal from January 20 to 24.  Peak
power prices for Tuesday delivery at Into TVA also gained ground from prices
seen on Friday, with pieces changing hands from 18.25 to 21.5$/MWh on
Monday.  ""Prices started out at the low end, but I think some buyers got
caught, and didn't mind paying a little more to cover themselves, so prices
came up over the session,"" ventured one savvy trader.  There were no new
unit outages or curtailments to report in the SERC region on Monday, despite
assertions by various players that some units must be out.

Bear Sighting in the West

Despite the uncertainty that goes hand in hand with scheduling three days
out, Western peak power prices for Monday delivery were mostly lower on
Friday amid a plethora of bearish fundamentals.  Waning weather-related
demand, lower spot gas prices and ample hydroelectric generation were some
of the forces placing downward pressure on the daily electricity market.  ""I
can't believe how low prices are right now, so low in fact that they are
below the cost of our gas-fired generation,"" said one frustrated would-be
seller.  The weather outlook offered little hope for strength in the near
term, with heating demand in the WSCC expected to average a mere 68 percent
of normal through January 11.  Light load goods did manage to gain a little
strength at some of the Western hubs, mainly on the inclusion of the all-day
Sunday piece.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for February and March were almost
unchanged from the previous day, both gaining less than one cent on Friday.
""Given the current weather outlook, we could see some more downside for
Henry Hub contracts on Monday,"" warned one gas watcher.

Monday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were mostly flat to lower
on Friday as mild weather forecasts and abundant hydropower continued to
depress the market.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia traded from 17.75 to
20$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions occurring around the 18.75$/MWh mark.
Balance-of-January contracts trading in the 20.25 to 20.75$/MW range was a
good indicator that most players were not expecting any significant rise in
prices through the month.  Light load goods fell by as much as 1.25$/MWh,
with confirmed trades taking place anywhere between 15.75 and 17.5$/MWh.
""There's just nothing out there that could bring the dailies up, the weather
is just too mild and hydro too plentiful,"" said one Washington-based trader.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed Friday, coming in at 75
kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday, 105 kcfs Tuesday through
Thursday, and 100 kcfs on Friday.

Power prices for the Sunday/Monday package in the Golden State followed the
rest of the Western electricity market down on Friday.  ""The California snow
pack is around 160%, gas storage is high, prompt-month gas is down, forwards
are off, precipitation is plentiful, and to top it all off the weather is
mild.  Basically every fundamental I can think of is bearish,"" said one
northern trader of the dailies' plunge.  ""With gas storage so high, it will
take a longer cold snap than usual to generate an upside in this market,""
said another, adding that the extended forecast didn't call for a possible
change in the weather until January 17.  Electricity at NP15 and SP15 traded
almost flat to one another.  NP15 peak goods changed hands between 22.5 and
25$/MWh, while the off-peak product saw action from 17.25 to 19$/MWh.  On
the generation front, Los Medanos (550 MW) was operating at 530 MW on
Friday.  Fellow gas-fired generators Morro Bay #3 (337 MW) and Alamitos #4
(320 MW) were out of service for planned maintenance.  High temperatures for
the early part of the new week were expected in the mid-50s at mid-state
load centers, and in the upper-60s in southern regions.  Overnight lows were
anticipated to be about 13 to 16 degrees below the highs.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from January 10 to 14.

Not even news of new unit outages was enough to perk up spot prices in the
Southwest on Friday, though the all-day Sunday/off-peak Monday package did
see a smidgeon of strength.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 21 to
25$/MWh, with most trades taking place from 22.5 to 23$/MWh.  In unit news,
it was confirmed that San Juan #1 (350 MW) was brought down on Tuesday for
tube leak repairs.  Sources said that the unit was due back ""any minute
 now,"" but it had yet to be revived as of this writing.  Four Corners #4 and
#5 (750 MW each) tripped Friday due to ""instrument error,"" and were given an
ETR of sometime on Sunday.  Mohave #2 (790 MW) was expected to attempt a
return Friday night, but players with a share of the unit indicated that it
had not been scheduled in place for Sunday or Monday.  ""Those units [Mohave]
are so unreliable on startup, that they've got to be up and running for 24
hours before you can say that they're really back,"" joked one marketer.
Looking ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to enter a 30-day
spring maintenance outage on March 16.  Weather forecasts for the Phoenix
area called for warming through Tuesday, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for mostly above-normal temperatures in Arizona and normal
conditions in New Mexico from January 10 through 14.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 4, 2002 for January 7, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts calling for milder temperatures in the new week and a
volatile gas market, heavy load electricity prices for Monday delivery
traded much lower across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  The Southeast
lost the most ground, with prices falling throughout the day.  NYMEX Henry
Hub natural gas futures were flat to Thursday's bearish levels, with the
front-month closing up less than a cent at 2.275$/mmBtu.  March picked up
just 0.2 cent to end at 2.265$/mmBtu.


Amid significantly fewer electricity imports, a stronger real-time price for
most of the morning, and rumors of a base-load nuclear unit still off-line,
peak power prices only shed a relatively benign 2$/MWh.  Western PJM goods
changed hands between 26.25 and 26.75$/MWh, with the high end bid up very
late in the day.  The bulk of deals were done between 26.35 and 26.4$/MWh.
Some traders thought Salem #2 (1,106 MW) was still down, or tripped in the
early morning after coming back briefly Thursday, but no one was entirely
certain which units were off Friday.  LMPs bounced between 25 and 31$/MWh
for most of the morning, and averaged 24.79$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Monday
forecasts called for low temperatures in the 34 to 35 degree range, firmly
above freezing, while highs were expected to stay in the 37 to 41 degree
range.  The latest six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal temperatures
from January 10 to 14.

With weather conditions expected to warm up in the new week, peak power
prices slipped in the Midwest on Friday in active trade.  Into Cinergy
pieces were bought and sold between 19 and 26$/MWh.  In unit news, Illinois
nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) powered down to 90% capacity on Friday, on its way
to a mid-month refueling outage.  High temperatures were expected just above
freezing on Monday, with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS called for mostly above-normal temperatures from
January 10 to 14.

Rising gas concerns spelled falling electricity prices in the Southeast on
Friday.  ""The market was pushed down all day, but fell very fast at the end
when lots of people were trying to sell based on rumors that gas prices were
going to come off even more.  They really got burned by their positions,""
commented one trader on the tanking Southeastern spot market.  Into Entergy
prices were seen from 22.5$/MWh out-of-the-gate down to 17$/MWh.
Balance-of-the-month also weakened on Friday, trading between 20 and
21$/MWh, falling over a dollar to a day ago, mainly on the mild weather
outlook.  Into TVA deals were heard between 21.5 and 25.5$/MWh, trailing
down more than 5$/MWh on both ends.  According to sources, maintenance at
one of TVA's coal-fired Paradise units (704, 704, and 1,150 MW) was
reportedly at least a week behind schedule.  Weather conditions were
expected to warm up in the early part of the new week, giving thin-blooded
Southerners some relief from the snow and cold that saddled the region this
week.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly below-normal temperatures
from January 10 to 14.

Too Much Gas

Day-ahead peak power prices in the WSCC fell for the second session in a
row, largely on the reduced loads associated with a Friday/Saturday combo.
Several players believed that mild forecasts for much of the West and
abundant hydro supplies in the Northwest were also adding to the bearish
tenor of the marketplace.  ""Prices were really bad [weak] today, and looking
at the weather forecasts, that's not going to change anytime soon,"" said one
marketer.  ""Even with businesses and schools back in full swing next week,
the upside will be limited due to the mild weather, ample gas storage, and
abundant Northwest hydro power,"" he added.  Peak power prices began the day
weak, and continued to fall throughout the trading session.  Light load
goods were also on the decline, though not as significantly as peak hour
prices, in most cases, as overnight temperatures in many areas remained well
entrenched in heating demand territory.   NYMEX Henry Hub contracts were
lower midday on Thursday, then fell sharply following the release of yet
another bearish AGA inventory report.  February Hub gas shed an impressive
19.7 cents or eight percent to close at 2.268$/mmBtu, while March lost 18
cents to settle at 2.263$/mmBtu.  Thursday's AGA report showed a draw of 124
bcf in the U.S. last week, below most industry estimates that were calling
for a 140 to 150-bcf decline.  The same week saw a 209-bcf draw last year,
and an average drop of 147 bcf over the past five years.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.856 tcf are 1.127 tcf above last year, and 615 bcf above
the five-year average.  Of the 124 bcf drawn last week, only 12 bcf were
removed from the Consuming Region West.  Western stocks stood at 82 percent
of full at 414 bcf, well above last year's level of 286 bcf.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 4.25$/MWh for
the Friday/Saturday package, while light load goods only fell by 1$/MWh.
Lighter weekend loads and abundant hydropower were the most oft-cited
explanations for the falling dailies.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the Northwest was only expected to average 84 percent of
normal through January 9, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting above-normal temperatures in the region's major load centers from
January 9 through 13.  ""Given the amount of available hydropower and the
over-abundance of gas in storage, it will take some prolonged cold weather
to boost the day-ahead market, something that looks doubtful anytime soon,""
said one Northwest utility trader.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained
strong at 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs
Monday, and 105 kcfs next Tuesday through Thursday.

As weaker gas prices took their toll on the highly dependent California
market, electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday package softened on
Thursday, despite more off-line megawatts than a day ago.  ""The gas glut has
been a problem so far this winter, and now the plentiful rain in the north
is just adding more to the off-kilter supply dynamic.  The dailies came off
a lot late in the day, which I think will continue on Friday,"" commented one
Golden State guru, while another confined himself to saying, ""The AGA was
not good.""  Spot gas at the Southern California Border notched down another
few cents, transacting between 2.33 and 2.38$/mmBtu.  Heavy load goods at
NP15 saw action from 22 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done between
23.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  The light load product traded between 16 and 21$/MWh,
with the low end reached late.  In unit news, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW) was
operating at 185 MW on Thursday, while Alamitos #4 (320 MW) was derated to
100 MW.  Los Medanos (550 MW) upped its output to 150 MW.  Large gas-fired
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) exited the grid for unplanned maintenance.  The
weather picture stayed steady (read: boring) on Thursday.  Mid-state load
centers expected highs in the mid-50s and lows in the mid-40s on Friday,
while Southern cities anticipated temperatures about 10 degrees warmer.
Little change was forecast through the first day of the new week, and the
latest six-to-ten called for continued above-normal temperatures from
January 9 to 13.

Despite some ongoing outages, day-ahead electricity prices in the Southwest
fell for the weekend combo.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded anywhere from
24.75$/MWh early, to 22.75$/MWh, and possibly lower, in late trade.  Most
players did not anticipate much strength in the days to come, as was
evidenced by balance-of-the-month contracts that were heard selling between
24 and 25$/MWh on Thursday.  In unit news, Cholla #4 (375 MW) was still
off-line with no available ETR as of this writing.  Coronado #1 (365 MW) was
expected to return on January 8, while Mohave #2 (790 MW) was sporting an
ETR of 14:00 MST on January 6, but players familiar with the unit said the
ETR has been getting pushed further back on a daily basis.  There were
reports that San Juan #1 (350 MW) was off line, but no confirmation was
obtainable.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal
temperatures in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 9
through 13, while weather derivatives pegged heating demand in the desert
region at 90 percent of normal through January 13.

___________________________________________________________
As regional differences made their presence felt in the market, peak power
prices posted mixed results across the Eastern Interconnect on Thursday.
Propelled by a snowstorm and unseasonably cold temperatures, day-ahead
electricity prices strengthened at the southeastern hubs, while spot prices
at northern hubs weakened slightly, but still maintained Wednesday's robust
levels.  With warming in the extended forecast, traders were not optimistic
that prices would stay high into the new week.  On another down note, the
AGA listed last week's national draw at 124 bcf, below most industry
estimates.  Traders said they were expecting a draw of around 140, and were
hoping for a number closer to 160.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
plunged on the news, with the front-month losing 19.7 cents to settle at
2.268$/mmBtu.  March shed 18 cents to close at 2.263$/mmBtu.

With the return of a key unit to the grid and a break in the below-normal
temperatures expected by Saturday at the latest, heavy load electricity
prices softened on Thursday.  Big nuke Salem #2 (1,106 MW) was back in
service on Thursday, along with approximately 1600 additional MW of power.
Western PJM goods changed hands between 26.95 and 28.25$/MWh, skidding down
almost 3$/MWh on the high and 2$/MWh on the low.  From a high of 55.83$/MWh
at 09:15 EST, LMPs declined steadily as the day progressed, averaging
22.59$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Forecasts for Friday predicted highs in the
low-40s and overnight lows in the mid-20s across PJM.  Temperatures were
expected to remain within 3 degrees of normal through Sunday, and the latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for mostly normal temperatures from January 9
to 13.

Amid forecasts calling for slightly warmer weather and rumors of a unit
outage, day-ahead energy costs fell in the Midwest on Thursday.  According
to Reuters, Illinois-based Cordova (537 MW) was off-line for much of
Thursday, but returned to the grid in the late afternoon, however, traders
were unable to confirm the outage.  Into Cinergy peak products were bought
and sold between 25 and 29.5$/MWh.  Daytime high temperatures were expected
in the 34 to 39 degree range in ECAR on Friday, with the corresponding lows
expected in the high-teens.  Lows were predicted to be well out of the teens
by Saturday, and the most current six-to-ten called for mostly normal
temperatures, with above-normal conditions at the northwestern edges of the
region, from January 9 to 13.

As very cold weather kept electricity demand high and despite much weaker
natural gas prices, peak power prices for Friday delivery firmed up in the
Southeast on Thursday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 24.5 and
28.25$/MWh, while Into TVA heavy load goods transacted from 26 to
30.75$/MWh.  The bulk of deals were heard above 29$/MWh.  Friday lows were
expected to drop into the frigid teens, while highs were expected to climb
into the upper-30s.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal
temperatures from January 9 to 13.

From ENE to ENRNQ to EBAY

Heavy load electricity prices in the Western U.S. continued their recent
rise amid ongoing below-normal temperatures and curtailed generation.  Some
parties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role in
strengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  ""The curtailment at Diablo
Canyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  We
have below-normal temperatures everywhere, and California is having to
import lots of power from outside the state,"" said one marketer.  In fact,
there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall below
acceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergency
declaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher on
Wednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGA
weekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,
while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report
indicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in line
with most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,
1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the five-year
average.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of the
Western Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convinced
that next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In other
industry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of the
Enron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday with
lawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energy
committee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive
who wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of big
troubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shares
were trading on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter market in which
companies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enron
stock, which now trades under the symbol ""enrnq"", fell 20 cents to close at
31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of
$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,
largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exports
to California.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,
with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday and
Wednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained off
line, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330
MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecasts
were calling for below-normal temperatures to continue through the weekend,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal
temperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.

Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves falling
below WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricity
prices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in the
Golden State.  ""Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There was
some excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that the
CAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been a
while since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying in
California,"" said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 were
heard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchanged
between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with odd-lot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.
In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers on
Wednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility's
reorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practices
as ""ethical and fair"".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down on
Wednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned to
the grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in the
capital and other mid-state interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Area
and southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper-30s
to mid-40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Below-normal temperatures and increased demand from California helped to
boost day-ahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh on
Wednesday.  ""They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've even
been asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through the
evening peak,"" said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verde
saw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to
29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quickly
ratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking to
gobble up surplus supplies.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling
for below-normal temperatures to continue from January 22 through 26.

As stronger natural gas prices, unit curtailments, and winter weather made
their presence felt, day-ahead electricity prices settled slightly higher
across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  While temperatures remained
cool, there was little change in the weather pattern since Tuesday, which
left traders perplexed about the source of Wednesday's strength,
particularly in the Midwest.  The AGA's weekly storage report listed a
withdrawal of 137 bcf, dead on with industry estimates of 135 to 140 bcf.
The AGA had little influence on late trading, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas
futures rose on Wednesday.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at
2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.

As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid were
heard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed
hands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain that
the Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that a
different Pennsylvania unit was newly off-line on Wednesday, but no one was
certain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a two
hour mid-morning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon and
averaged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected in
the upper-40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid-30s.  Cooling of
about five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM and
above-normal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.

Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,
heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest on
Wednesday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to
22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract also
traded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost a
dollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at their
Illinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down since
January 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR was
given.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-30s on Thursday,
with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly
above-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast on
Wednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slipping
towards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contract
saw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were done
between 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the
50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from
January 22 to 26.

"RE: Stream Flow Deal","Sanjeev:

For your discussions with PacifiCorp we are pricing up the 100% Coullee product only. It didn't appear beneficial to offer a very high price on the multi-stream deal that we really don't have a way to hedge.  Glenn is looking into the dual trigger pricing models that we used a year ago that actually settle vs. the power price trigger rather than 100% of the power value. This should be less expensive and more appropriately match PacifiCorp's risk exposure (i.e. combination of low water, high prices).

Good luck with the meeting.

Greg:

As per discussions, if possible let's price:

The structure as per deal sheet. PacifiCorp tells me that they have done half piece (that's what is in the term sheet) at $1.5 million per year for five years. I know for sure that the volume is same but I am not sure about caps. Our simulations are app. $2 to $2.5 million, assuming 2001 as the worst year in last 30 years and that impact of deficit is carried forward.

Alternate structure that we are comfortable with. As per PacifiCorp, they are open to an alternate structure but they would like to include Coulee, as this is the largest 
exposure to them (and we are ok with this as well). Another change can be an introduction of strikes on both sides e.g. $25/MWh or $/50/MWh.

Let's talk on Monday and go through the results. I would be in Portland on Tuesday and will work with Mike and Glenn to finalize the numbers.

Thanks again for your help,

Sanjeev

"Daily Update","
Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days.

New Board Member & Committee Elected

Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board.  Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts.  He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973.

Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.

SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation

We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest.

With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information.  We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation.

We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events.  Please check back frequently for information and new developments.

I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

"couple things","Mike,

Hope everything is going as well as could be expected.  First, I wanted to
ask you for a favor in that we are basically short to you 175 mw of cal 02
cob light and and 100 mw of 03 cob light.  Cob is such a thin market and I
was hoping you might be able to help us out on counterparties who might have
offsetting positions I could bookout with.  Second, we are going to be
looking to expand at the beginnning of 02, our credit is good with just
about everyone now, and we will be looking to hire one or two experienced
people to trade the west, especially one long term guy.  We're obviously not
as big as some shops but we have a very aggressive bonus payout.  Anyway,
something to keep in mind once things get more settled up there for you
guys.  Thanks to you and Bob for the help yesterday booking some of this
stuff out.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

On the Auction Block

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. continued to fall Monday
against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals.  While mild weather
for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline,
lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also
lending a helping hand.  ""I don't know if prices can dip much below current
levels, but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on
the margin, and we could see some single digit prices,"" said one marketer.
Temperatures were forecast to remain at above-normal levels through the
week, with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to
average only 69 percent of normal through January 14, though some cooling
was expected next week.  ""Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the
Northwest and California next week, but temperatures are not expected to
fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand,"" said one
Oregon-based trader, who added, ""And even if temperatures do fall
considerably, abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a
minimum.""  On the political front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said
Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in U.S.
regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of
one-time energy giant Enron Corp.  ""I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on
this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its
obligations under the existing rules,"" said O'Neill of the provisions that
allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron
stock in retirement plans could not.  ""If they did [comply with U.S.
regulations], it suggests that we need rule change.  If, on the contrary, it
turns out that they didn't fully comply with all the rules, we have a
different issue on our hands,"" O'Neill said on NBC.  An auction of Enron's
trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday, though no details had been
released as of this writing.  ""We hear that there are more than the two
original suitors that will be bidding on Enron, which is good news for Enron
traders, but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced, so it may be
a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining
the company,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 2$/MWh on Monday
as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies
healthy.  Light load goods fell by an average of 1.75$/MWh.  ""It was a quiet
day, with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation,"" said
one Northwest utility trader.  There were some rumors that the 484 MW
gas-fired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning, but confirmation
was not available.  ""It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway,"" said one
trader of the possible outage.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
slightly lower than on Friday, despite recent rains, but remained healthy at
85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and 85 kcfs next
Monday.  Weather forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in Portland
and Seattle over the course of the week, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures across the entire region
from January 13 through 17.  ""The six-to-ten offered some longs a glimmer of
hope today, but it's too far off to rely upon, and the current over
abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold
snap,"" hypothesized one market pundit.

With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and
plenty of supply flooding the electricity market, power prices settled lower
across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade.  Players speculated on where
prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out.  However, with
no cold weather on the horizon, most players were pessimistic of a quick
turn-around.  ""Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro.  They
probably won't, but they could,"" commented one California trader.  On-peak
goods at NP15 and SP15 traded mostly flat to each other, between 20.5 and
22.5$/MWh, while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers, with deals
heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh.  Light load transactions were heard mostly
in the 15 to 17$/MWh range.  In generation news, Moss Landing #6 (739 MW)
was operating at 500 MW on Monday.  The Duke unit was derated for planned
maintenance.   Fellow gas-fired generator Haynes #6 (341 MW) was all the way
off-line for planned maintenance, with no official cause or ETR.  However,
the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer.
Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday, with
high temperatures expected in the mild mid-50s to upper-60s. The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures along the coast and
in Northern California, with normal temperatures in the southern interior,
from January 13 to 17.

Unseasonably mild weather, lower spot gas prices and returning generation
were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as
3.5$/MWh, while light load goods shed as much as 4.25$/MWh.  On the unit
front, Four Corners #4 and #5 (750 MW each), San Juan #1 (350 MW), and
Mohave #2 (790 MW) were all back in service Monday morning following
unplanned outages that began last week.  A six-to-ten-day forecast calling
for normal temperatures in Arizona and above-normal temperatures in New
Mexico from January 13 through 17 offered little hope for those looking for
a significant upswing in the market.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 7, 2002 for January 8, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    20.50     1.50    22.00     -4.00

Into TVA        21.00    -0.50    21.50     -4.00
___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer temperatures as the week progresses and a healthy
generation landscape, day-ahead electricity prices mostly softened across
the Eastern Interconnect on Monday.  Into Entergy was the exception,
rallying late when a large buyer entered the market.  NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas prices remained almost unchanged on Monday.  The front-month
contract lost 0.3 cent to end at 2.272$/mmBtu, while March edged down a
nearly identical 0.4 cent to close at 2.261$/mmBtu.

Despite transmission work at several points on the Eastern Interface and
predictions of below-normal temperatures for Tuesday, peak power prices
floated lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM day-ahead goods
changed hands between 25.45 and 26.25$/MWh.  Balance-of-the-week trades were
heard from 24.5 to 25$/MWh, off a little on forecasts for gradually warming
weather this week.  ""There needs to be some sustained cold weather to give
demand and prices a boost,"" said one PJM dealer.  High temperatures were
expected in the upper-30s on Tuesday, before climbing into the upper-40s on
Wednesday and lingering there through Friday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

The story was the same in the Midwest, as weak demand and warmer forecasts
plagued the spot market, sending heavy load energy costs for Tuesday
delivery lower.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 20.5 to 22$/MWh,
sliding 4$/MWh on the high end.  No new outages were reported on Monday.
High temperatures were expected in the 35 to 40 degree range on Tuesday,
while the mercury was expected to climb even more by Wednesday, with highs
forecast to reach into the low-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery posted mixed results in the Southeast
on Monday, as arbitrage between hubs sent the Entergy dailies higher and
left TVA unaffected.  ""Into Entergy prices were driven up late.  I think
some of the bidders were buying in order to sell to Southern today, with
transmission not difficult to come by and that hub at a premium,"" explained
one trader.  The heavy load product Into Entergy saw action from 19 to
25$/MWh, gaining 2$/MWh on the low end and 2.5$/MWh on the high.  Into TVA
goods traded between 21 and 21.5$/MWh.  Traders were also relieved to see
natural gas prices up, albeit incrementally, on Monday.  Market player had
been worried on Friday that prices would fall again on Monday.  Temperatures
were expected to rise into the mid-40s on Tuesday at most major load
centers, with further warming anticipated through Thursday, with highs
expected to reach the spring-like low-60s. The latest six-to-ten called for
normal conditions from January 13 to 17.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.

Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. 


A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. 


Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. 


A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. 


Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. 


Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. 


The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said. 

 
       Racing Against The Liquidity Clock 
   
""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC's limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. 

The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. 


Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. 


According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. 


But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. 


On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. 


It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets truly complicated. 


The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. 


While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. 


Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. 


Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. 


FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. 


But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. 


""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. 


As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. 


The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. 


Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. 


The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. 


Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. 


Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" 


Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It's a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. 


A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. 


""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.""

"Lousiana Pacific Deal # 421598.1","All-

  Per an inquiry from Lousiana Pacific regarding deal # 421598.1 (LT NW):

  Structure: 		7 MW around the clock, 100% load factor. Buy back at basis or remarket at a 70% / 30% split.
  
  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
  February 24, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 1 - 24.   Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the ""buy-back"" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.


  Thanks,

  Virginia

"Enron Updates","
Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

And the Winner Is???

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose slightly Tuesday on
revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few
days.  The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest, where
heating demand was forecast to climb to above-normal levels by week's end.
""They've got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and that's what limited the
upside, but that also means there's less power available from the north, so
our prices went up a little as well,"" said one Southern California utility
trader.  Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder
weather draws closer, but most expected the upside to be limited due to the
abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices.  In other industry
news, Weil Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, reported
Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron
Corp.'s energy trading business.  Weil plans to announce the winning bidder
at its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S.
bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday.  Meanwhile, the court
is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to
Texas.  While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential, it was
reported that Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg were among the suitors, though a
third financial institution that had previously expressed interest, J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co., declined to submit a bid by Monday's night's deadline.
British company BP Plc. also said it may be interested in the operations,
and had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's
assets, including some back office functions and some IT assets.  Enron's
lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but
rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of 1$/MWh for
Wednesday delivery.  Cooler weather forecasts were near-universally blamed
for the rising dailies, though most players conceded that healthy river
flows would limit the upside.  ""The colder weather is a small blessing for
sellers, but also for the region as a whole.  The recent warm weather has
caused some snowmelt, something few people want to see until the spring, and
the lower temperatures should put a stop to that,"" said one Northwest
trader.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was
expected to average 64 percent of normal Wednesday, and then rise to a peak
of 120 percent of normal by Sunday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
little changed from a day ago, coming in at 85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and back up to 85 kcfs next Monday and Tuesday.

Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather, day-ahead electricity
prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday.  Gains were
modest, on the order of a dollar everywhere.  Traders cited colder
temperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gas
prices as the main factors leading prices higher.  ""Balance of the month is
trading at a premium to the dailies, which is usually a sign of coming
strength,"" said one trader.  Peak goods at NP15 were bought and sold between
22.25 and 23.75$/MWh, while the off-peak products changed hands from 16.5 to
18$/MWh.  In political news, the FERC judge for the California refund case
said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July 12, and submit his
proposal to FERC by early August.  The state accuses energy companies of
overcharging during last year's energy crisis, an allegation the companies
deny.  On a less litigious note, last month FERC asked the CAISO to come up
with a detailed plan for reforming the state's energy market.  The proposal
could be unveiled as early as late Tuesday, and would include elements of
the much-admired PJM RTO.  It would also emphasize a way to reduce
intra-zonal congestion and include a plan for a day-ahead market, although
on a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX.  There were no
dramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday.  Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) and Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid, while hydro unit Big
Creek Project (1,020 MW) was operating at 970 MW.  On the weather front,
Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mid-50s and low-60s
at mid-state load centers, and in the high-60s in the south.  Little change
was expected in temperatures through Saturday.  The most current six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than a
dollar on Tuesday, with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spot
gas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon.  Peak power at Palo Verde
ranged from 20 to 22$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen right in the
middle at 21$/MWh.  Balance-of-January contracts were heard trading at about
a $2/MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday, likely in reaction to the cooler
forecasts.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) was in the process of
restarting Tuesday afternoon, as expected.  Four Corners #5 (750 MW) was
operating at 550 MW Tuesday due to air-preheater problems, with no available
ETR to full.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desert
region to climb from its current level of 50 percent of normal, to just
above normal over the coming weekend, but the latest six-to-ten was still
calling for a mix of normal and above-normal temperatures from January 14
through 18.

Amid forecasts for warmer weather on Wednesday and little else changed in
market fundamentals, heavy load energy costs drifted lower across the
Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""The EIA revised the Q1 electricity demand
estimate downwards today.  That shouldn't really affect the dailies, but
sometimes its what people think will happen that matters more than what
actually does happen,"" suggested one market analyst, who added that he
thought weather was a greater factor in the dip in day-ahead prices.  NYMEX
Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher on Tuesday.  February gained
0.9 cents to close at 2.281$/mmBtu, while the March contract picked up 2.4
cents to end at 2.285$/mmBtu.

Day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday amid
warm weather forecasts for the rest of this week and next, and on light
demand in the region.  Western PJM goods changed hands in a narrow range
between 24.2 and 24.85$/MWh.  According to traders, prices were low out of
the gate, climbed to the peak within an hour, and ended the day back down at
the low end.  No new outage information was available on Tuesday.  High
temperatures were expected in the 45 to 51 degree range in PJM on Wednesday,
and forecast to stay within five degrees of there through Saturday.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Temperatures in the Midwest were expected to climb to their highest level of
the week on Wednesday, bringing peak power prices down by about a dollar on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Wednesday delivery traded between 19.55
and 21.25$/MWh, dropping 0.75 and 0.95$/MWh off the high and low ends,
respectively.  The February contract gained some support Tuesday morning,
opening strong and climbing to 23.15$/MWh before dropping back down to
22.25$/MWh.  ""Prior to the open, gas looked strong, and people were buying
February to cover their shorts, but gas came off fast and that was the end
of that,"" said one trader of the ill-fated early rally and fizzle.
Temperatures at most ECAR load centers were expected to hit the upper-40s on
Wednesday, with corresponding lows in the mid-30s.  Thursday forecasts
called for temperatures to stay near that level, while Friday was expected
to cool five to seven degrees.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

As natural gas weakness continued to concern Southeastern traders, and
forecasts called for significantly warmer temperatures for the rest of the
week, heavy load electricity prices softened in the Southeast on Tuesday.
Into Entergy deals were done from 19 to 20$/MWh, while Into TVA deals for
Wednesday delivery were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  TVA prices
reached their low late in the day.  In unit news, sources said one of the
Scherer coal units (832, 833, 844, and 844 MW) was off-line but expected
back on Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Four Days Before Christmas

'Twas 4 days before Christmas, and all thru the West
Few traders were working, 10 percent at best;
Marketers had tallied their books up with care,
In hopes that year-end bonuses soon would be there.

Enron was nestled down deep in the red,
Battling lawsuits from many, and claims by the Fed;
With Osama on the run, and Jeff Skilling in Brazil,
There are not many wishes left to fulfill.

Stockings were hung by the boilers with care,
But lumps of coal showed that Enron passed there;
All rejoice and thanks to Ken Lay,
Even Santa frets 'bout his 401k.

With hydro abundant, and gas storage so high,
It looked as though the West would not bat an eye;
The shorts in the market sang a chorus of cheer,
""Prices are a shadow of what they were last year.""

Another calendar gone by, and what a doozy it was,
So close up your shops, catch a well-deserved buzz;
A sincere wish for all, we hope you made a buck,
Happy Holidays to all, and to all Good Luck!


But seriously folks?Western peak power prices for the Christmas
Day/Wednesday package were mostly flat to levels seen for the Sunday/Monday
combo.  ""It's supposed to get a little bit colder out there over the long
weekend, but the combination of weak holiday demand and abundant hydro
generation has given traders little cause for concern,"" explained one
marketer.  Spot gas prices on most Western pipelines were flat to slightly
higher than levels seen on the previous day, while NYMEX Henry Hub futures
contracts rose sharply on some colder forecasts for the eastern U.S. and a
flurry of short covering ahead of the long weekend.  January Hub gas rose an
impressive 20.9 cents to close at 2.895$/mmBtu, while February gained 18.1
cents to settle at 2.889$/mmBtu.  With end-of-the-year loads firmly in
place, most players expected little in the way of price movement over the
next week.

Electricity prices in the Northwest were virtually unchanged for the
Tuesday/Wednesday package, compliments of steady holiday loads and abundant
regional hydropower.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia changed hands from
19.25 to 21$/MWh, with the bulk of trades taking place between 19.5 and
20.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were off slightly from the
previous day, likely in anticipation of waning holiday demand.  Flows were
predicted to be 75 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 70 kcfs Christmas Eve, 50
kcfs Christmas Day, and 85 kcfs Wednesday through Friday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for mostly normal temperatures through
the end of the month.

Peak power prices in California for Wednesday delivery ended slightly weaker
than the Sunday-Monday package.  In the news, a report by the Bureau of
State Audits, released Thursday, criticized the California Department of
Water Resources for a lack of analysis of power demand in the state before
it signed 57 contracts for long-term power with energy companies.  The
urgency generated by pressure from the Davis administration to sign
long-term agreements precluded the planning necessary for projects of such
large-scale, according to the report, and resulted in the omission of
important details which would have better shielded California in the event
of failure by the supplier to deliver the power, or in times of excess
demand.  The contracts were negotiated in a matter of weeks rather than the
usual months, and tied Californians into paying more than double the current
spot prices for electricity for the next decade.  Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman
for the team of buyers at the DWR, defended the DWR's performance, saying
""The lights are on; the costs are way down; stability is back in the market.
The long-term contracts are a big part of it.""  However, the Bureau's report
noted that the state likely bought too much electricity, and as a result
will have to sell much of its power during times of low demand at a loss on
the spot market.  This alone could cost consumers as much as $4 billion over
the next decade.  At the same time, the contracts do not include many
commitments from ""peaker"" (intermittent load-contingent) plants, which would
make the state once again vulnerable to price spikes at times of peak
demand.  In unit news, gas-fired Contra Costa #7 (337 MW) slipped back onto
the grid after a one-day maintenance outage.  Encina #5 (332 MW) also began
ramping up on Friday, and was at 250 MW by 11:15 PST.  Temperatures were
slightly below normal but above freezing, and expected to remain that way
through Christmas.  The latest six-to-ten called for some cooling from
December 27 to 31.

Peak prices in the Southwest were little changed for the Tuesday/Wednesday
package, while light load goods fell modestly, by less than 1$/MWh in most
cases.  ""We anticipate little change in prices or demand through January 1,""
said one Southwest utility trader.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (790 MW)
remained off-line Friday with no ETR available.  The unit was reportedly
suffering from exciter problems, but details were vague.  Weather forecasts
called for temperatures to dip to slightly below normal over the weekend in
Phoenix, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting
below-normal temperatures for the entire desert region for the last week in
December.

Faced with apathetic holiday demand, prices across the Eastern Interconnect
plummeted for Monday delivery.  ""Without schools, businesses, or even myself
in operation on Monday, almost nothing moved today,"" admitted one trader of
his intention to avoid the energy market on Christmas Eve.  Most traders
were putting together their Wednesday packages on Friday, in order to extend
their weekends through the Christmas holiday.  ""Wednesday prices showed
strength over Friday packages, presumably on the uncertainty of trading so
far out and forecasts calling for cooler weather over the next week,"" opined
one PJM player.  NYMEX Henry Hub forward contracts showed renewed vigor on
colder late-month forecasts and heavy short covering.  The January contract
gained 20.9 cents to close at 2.895$/mmBtu, while the February contract rose
18.1 cents to end the day at 2.889$/mmBtu.

Not even the Mid-Atlantic bucked the trend on Friday.  Marketers were
restless and eager to either cover their meager loads or divest themselves
of their excess energy and then head home for the holidays.  There was not a
lot of volatility in the LMPs, which briefly spiked to 56.4$/MWh just after
07:00 EST, but swiftly fell into the near-average groove of 21.61$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  Monday prices hovered in a narrow range between 21 and
21.5$/MWh, while Wednesday pieces went at a premium even to Friday goods,
trading from 24.5 to 25.25$/MWh.  Nary an outage was reported in all of PJM,
which some marketers cited as yet another reason for the lackadaisical
nature of Friday's energy market.  Temperatures were predicted by Weather
Services Corp. to warm into above-normal territory by Christmas Day, while
the latest six-to-ten called for temperatures from near to below-normal
between December 27 and 31.

Prices across the Midwest slid by 4 to 6$/MWh for Monday delivery during
Friday's trading.  Most marketers reported making only one or two trades, as
above-normal temperatures precluded healthy heating demand and the almost
universal closures of businesses and schools ""took the spirit out of the
market,"" as one trader put it.  Monday Into Cinergy goods changed hands
between 14 and 18$/MWh, while Wednesday pieces sold for anywhere from 22 to
25$/MWh, a premium to prices seen for Friday.  ""There's some uncertainty
involved with trading five days out, and besides, it's supposed to get
colder,"" remarked one ECAR player.  No new unit outages were reported in
ECAR, though Palisades #1 (789 MW) remained in cold shutdown, as it has been
since the end of June 2001.  Temperatures lingered between the mid 20s and
the high 30s on Friday, but were expected to warm into the high 40s by the
end of the weekend, further shaving off heating demand for Monday.  The
latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to be near to below normal from
December 27 to 31.

SERC traders were scrambling to move what they could before everyone else
stampeded from their offices for the Christmas holiday, and few had any
trades to report.  ""With the Enron debacle, I think most of us are sitting
out the action until the end of the year,"" remarked one TVA player.  Monday
Into TVA pieces took a nosedive on Friday, trading between 15.75 and
17.5$/MWh - and the high end was almost an anomaly, according to the price
data of many marketers.  Into Entergy likewise tanked, moving for anywhere
from 17 to 21$/MWh.  Wednesday showed more strength, with Into TVA trading
at a slight premium to Friday's goods, from 22 to 22.5$/MWh, and Into
Entergy pieces trading from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Temperatures were not expected
to ratchet up heating demand over the next five days, for despite
below-normal temperatures across much of the region, daytime highs were
predicted to reach the upper 50s.  The latest six-to-ten called for
temperatures to fall to below normal levels from December 27 to 31.

"Long over due Amsterdam Update","Greetings from Amsterdam,

I know its been two months since the last update.  So this is long overdue.
But then again I haven't heard one peep out of 75% of you on this email
list, so sorry to say, this will be your last Update.  All of the dead beats
are getting dropped.  YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT!  Oh, and don't bother
emailing me with a bunch of excuses, you're getting dropped and that's that.
(Maybe I kidding....maybe I'm not....)

Well let's get everyone caught up........

This is going to be a long one, so get comfortable....the last two months
has involved a lot of travelling.  I've been to Switzerland, sailing in the
North Sea, London (twice, as per usual), Monaco, New York (twice, for two
weddings, also no surprise), and Spain.  I'll recap a few of my journeys for
everyone.....

I'd like to start with my trip to London.  I went to my first real Cricket
match, England vs. Pakistan.  Unfortunately I went with clients that knew
much more than I did about the sport.  The traders of Axia Energy easily
took me for ?300.  A word of advice for my American friends, do not bet on
English sports that you don't know anything about.  You would have figured
that I had known that.  Sometimes my stupidity even surprises me.....Okay
Axia, you got me this time, we'll see what happens this weekend at the
American Football match in Amsterdam...!

The following weekend I was off to the French Riviera and the Monaco Grand
Prix.....intense sporting event.  Mind numbingly loud, beautiful weather,
and a great night in the casino.  Although, it's official, my French sucks.
Six years of French in school and I barely know how to ask for a glass of
water.  I'm not happy about that.  Oh! Speaking of languages, I have
enrolled in formal Dutch lessons with a few guys from the desk.  Classes
begin in September, twice a week, two hours a night for two months.  I can't
wait for the Update after the final.  Yes, there is a final.  Any way, let's
continue.....

My next weekend brought back home to New York City and Bob and Stephanie's
wedding.  Congratulations you two, I think you should be back from your
honeymoon by now?  Anyway beautiful event, very happy I was asked to be a
part of it.  Great to see a lot of old friends.  And....as promised, I did
not have to find a hidden place to take a nap.  Dave and Felice, I still
feel bad about that.  While on the wedding thing.....last weekend I returned
home for 38 hours to attend Deirdra and Penn's wedding.  Surprisingly enough
I stayed awake for this one too!  In all fairness, it was easy, it was a day
wedding.  Which was very helpful.  Anyway those two are in the Caribbean
having a blast I'm sure.  Not me, it's 7:15pm and I'm in my office writing
this stupid e-mail.   I think I'm going to set up a cot behind my desk...?

I have to mention a little trip I took in between weddings.....a bunch of
the Prebon's European managers had an off-site meeting in the South of Spain
(Malaga to be exact).  It was suppose to be in Barcelona, but that's a whole
different story.  I think I'll leave that part of the story out.
Anyway.....I have learned a few things about travelling lately, especially
about air travel.  We all know I fly a lot, I mean a lot.  I have a new
rule, avoid crappy airlines like the plague.  It's just not worth it.
Airlines to avoid while in Europe....Basic Air (with that name alone, I
should have known better), Luxair, actually I can take that one step
further, avoid Luxembourg airport and any flight that flies there.  I'll
elaborate....why wouldn't I?....First of all I take KLM to Luxembourg, no
problems there and I have to transfer to a Luxair flight that will be taking
me to Malaga.  Well after waiting on line with a bunch of old rude people we
pile into a bus.  We wait in the hot sweaty bus for 15 minutes, finally the
bus leaves.  I kid you not, we the bus ride was 30 feet long.  I was in
shock.  Don't worry it gets worse.....I squeeze into my seat, I think there
was nine inches (22.5 centimeters) of leg room.  Every single seat is
occupied.  Miraculously I fall asleep....but not for long.  The flight
attendant wakes me up from a dead sleep in order to serve me my ""meal"", I'm
using that term loosely.  So now I'm awake (which I'm not happy about) and I
have the scariest pate in front of me I've ever seen.  It looked so bad I
had to try it.  For the first time in my life I almost had to employ the air
sickness bag.  It was horrible.  I do have to mention, there was one good
thing....after the ""meal"", they did serve complimentary cognac, which was
nice.  Quick frankly, I felt they owed to me, but I was thankful none the
less.   There is something else that bothered me, but it nothing to do with
Luxair....

Now that I have almost been poisoned, I knew that there was no chance for me
to fall back asleep.  So I start reading the book I brought with me, ""The
Bonfire of the Vanities"" by Tom Wolfe.  Well in the end I found the book
entertaining, but I have one major problem with it.  I'm reading about this
guy Lawrence Kramer who is on his way to the court house in the Bronx (he's
an Assistant District Attorney) and Tom Wolfe has this guy getting on the D
train at 81st street and Central Park West.  Duh!  Everybody knows that on
the upper west side the D train and the A train are both express from 59th
Street to 125th Street.  The only west side local train that stops at 81st
Street and the Bronx Courthouse (161st Street) is the B train and sometimes
the C train.  I know I'm being a little petty, but give me a break, the
author ""claims"" to reside in New York City (I read the back cover), get your
facts straight pal.

Tomorrow I'm off the European World Bowl (American Football) with 25
clients.  I have a feeling my high school team could beat either team, but
it should be fun none the less....we'll see.

I would like to welcome the following people into the world....Vanessa
Malhame, Joel Kabel and Melissa Moore (my new niece) who was just born on
Wednesday night!

That's it, until next time......Enjoy your summer,

-Douglas Pursel Moore

"2001 Special Stock Option Grant","MICHAEL SWERZBIN: 

As promised, I want to update you on the Special Stock Option Grant that I announced at the all-employee meeting.  

You have been awarded a stock grant as follows:

Special Stock Option Grant
Grant Date:  August 21, 2001 
Grant Price: $36.88 
Vesting: Options are 100 percent vested on date of grant
Number of options: Based on 5 percent of an employee's annualized base salary as of August 13, 2001 and a theoretical stock option value of $15. You will be notified of the actual number of stock options awarded to you.
Option Term: Five years
The terms and provisions of this grant are subject to the applicable 1991 or 1994 Enron Corp. Stock Plan, as will be referenced in the stock award agreement.

Employees who are eligible to participate in this special program will receive award details in the next several weeks.  More information about this grant will be available on the HR web site http://hrweb.enron.com.

As I mentioned at the employee meeting, one of my highest priorities is to restore investor confidence in Enron.  This should result in a significantly higher stock price.  I hope this grant lets you know how valued you are to Enron.  I ask your continued help and support as we work together to achieve this goal.  Again, on behalf of the Enron Board and myself, thanks for everything you are doing to make Enron the great company it is.  And stay tuned for regular updates from me about what is happening around Enron.

"Fw: I'm a real racing driver now Mike!","Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;
 
We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)

Subject:	NWS Winter Outlook

The NWS winter outlook is finalized. I have provided a link. The NWS is basically bullish in the East and Southern Canada for cold weather while mild to bearish in most of the West temperature-wise. The precipitation forecast for the Pac NW Hydro Basins is regarded as ""near normal"" or 95-105%. 

Note - this is the first time in 10 winter seasons that the NWS is forecasting below normal temperatures from the Midwest into the Northwest for DEC to FEB. 

Also, the finalized versions of Earth Sat are in all of your drop boxes.

"2001 Chairman's Award","Once again it is time to begin the nomination process for Enron's Chairman's Award.  

For those of you who are new to Enron, the Chairman's award is an employee-driven award designed to recognize Enron employees who make a difference in our organization by demonstrating our core values - Respect, Integrity, Communication, Excellence - in everything they do.  These individuals are the Everyday Heroes who make Enron a great place to work. They capture the spirit, the philosophy and the day-to-day business practices of our company in their work, their attitude and how they regard their colleagues.  

This award program will only be as successful as your participation in it.  All Enron employees can nominate fellow employees at any level - from the top down or the bottom up.  

Nomination forms will be available around the world.  Find the forms on your intranet site or at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  Direct any questions to mbx_chairmansaward@enron.com

The nomination process is simple.  Complete and submit the nomination form by Wednesday, October 10, 2001.  This year's Selection Committee will then review all nominations and present recommendations to the Office of the Chairman for final approval.

The Chairman's Award winner and finalists will be announced at the annual Enron Management Conference in San Antonio, Texas on November 16, 2001. 

I want to personally encourage each of you to think about your colleagues, their contributions to Enron and their adherence to our values.  If there is someone you know who is one of our many ""everyday heroes"" and you think they deserve to be recognized for their dedication and commitment to Enron's values, now is your turn to speak up?so please take the time to nominate someone you know for this very special award.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

Enron ""Stock"" (Certificates) Soars

As power contracts moved into the New Year, marketers across the WSCC saw
prices firm up, if only marginally.  ""We're still looking at some pretty
mild weather forecasts, and precipitation and flows are still healthy,""
noted one Northwest player.  Enron once again graced the wire agencies on
Friday, as always garnering dubious honors.  Collectors can now buy Enron
stock certificates for up to $99 on eBay.  That is almost $9 more than the
actual stock sold for on its best day!  Evidently, Enron's historic demise
has placed its stock in the same Hall of Fame as stock certificates from
Czarist Russia and from now-nonexistent countries, and is a sought-after
commodity by collectors and enthusiasts.  Meanwhile, abundant natural gas
supplies have kept a lid on NYMEX Henry Hub futures prices.  The February
contract, trading for its first day in the front-month position, gained 15.5
cents over the day's trading, erasing half of Thursday's loss, to close at
2.774$/mmBtu.  March followed hot on February's heels, rising 11.6 cents to
settle at 2.746$/mmBtu.

Peak power costs in the Northwest showed some strength in the new month on
news of a large outage in the eastern reaches of the region, the five-day
uncertainty, and forecasts for colder weather in the near future.
Mid-Columbia peak goods traded from 23.5 to 27$/MWh, a gain of 3.75$/MWh on
the high end and .75$/MWh on the low.  Temperatures across the region ranged
from firmly below freezing to the low 50s on Friday, but the five-day
forecast called for colder weather on both sides of the Cascade Range
through January 1.  The latest six-to-ten predicted Northwest temperatures
to stick just below normal from January 3 to 7.  Forecasted flows at Chief
Joseph remained healthy, but were revised slightly downward to 75 kcfs
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs Monday, 55 kcfs Tuesday, 95 kcfs Wednesday
and Thursday, and 90 kcfs next Friday.  There was no news of unit outages in
the Pacific Northwest on Friday, but East of the Rockies, in Montana, news
that PPL Montana's Colstrip #4 (740 MW) had tripped off line late Thursday
washed over the WSCC market.  Both the cause and the ETR were kept close to
the chest.

Despite softer gas prices on key pipelines in the West, day-ahead
electricity prices strengthened in the Golden State on Friday, with the
inclusion of the first working day of 2002 in the two-day package boosting
load forecasts.  As two unit outages affected the SP15 grid, heavy load
prices climbed almost 4$/MWh, trading between 26.75 and 30.75$/MWh.  Light
load goods changed hands between 20.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  Spot gas at the
Southern California border settled 9 cents lower on Friday from 2.43 to
2.48$/mmBtu.  In hydro happenings, the DWR reported that data for last week
shows the California snow pack already standing at 55% of expected April 1
levels.  If the current precipitation trends continue the snow pack will be
at 120% of the average, a welcome sign for all those watching generation at
the northern hydros.  In unit news, gas-fired Ormond Beach #1 (725 MW) was
off-line on Friday for planned maintenance, while Alamitos #6 (480 MW) also
tripped, but for unplanned reasons.  The five-day forecast continued to show
little change, as temperatures were expected to remain within 5 degrees of
normal through Tuesday.  Los Angeles forecasts called for highs in the
mid-60s Monday and Tuesday, while mid-state load centers were expected to be
about 10 degrees cooler.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from January 3 to 7.

With cold weather firmly entrenched across the Southwest and forecasts
calling for greater cooling and even snow, peak power at Palo Verde firmed
up about 3.25$/MWh on the high end for the first peak day of the New Year.
Peak goods traded from 26 to 29.25$/MWh on Friday, up from the 25 to 26$/MWh
seen on Thursday.  ""Sure it's kind of cold,"" admitted one seller, ""but
unless we get some big unit outages or a gas spike, we're not going to see
much strength in the market any time soon.""  There were no unit outages to
report in the Southwest on Friday.  Daytime highs in the north were on the
low side of freezing and expected to stay that way into next year, while
temperatures in the south ranged from the high 30s to mid-60s, and were
forecast to cool off as the New Year approaches.  The latest six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures to grip the region from January 3 to 7.

With light demand for New Year's Eve expected to lead into the middle of the
new week and colder temperatures on the horizon, peak power for Monday
delivery edged down across the Eastern Interconnect in lackluster end of the
week trading.  Wednesday goods gained ground as higher load forecasts pushed
early prices up.  ""We usually do 1500 MW of PJM dailies at least, but this
short week between the holidays we've been lucky to do 100 MW each day.
There just doesn't seem to be an active market out there,"" commented one
Mid-Atlantic trader, adding that he was heading home early, a sentiment
echoed by many in the East on Friday.  To the relief of many gas watchers,
NYMEX Henry Hub futures rebounded somewhat on Friday.  February climbed 15.5
cents to close at 2.774$/mmBtu, while March gained 11.6 cents to end at
2.746$/mmBtu.

Colder weather forecasts in the new week were balanced by light load
expectations ahead of the holiday, which sent heavy load electricity prices
down in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday.  ""Trading was choppy today.  I'd buy a
piece, and the offer would disappear before I could pick up another,""
commented one PJM dealer.  Western PJM goods for Monday delivery changed
hands between 23.75 and 24$/MWh, while early deals for Wednesday delivery
were heard between 24.5 and 27$/MWh.  Traders thought the market for
Wednesday would probably firm up on Monday.  ""Balance for next week looks
promising.  It's all that cold weather,"" said one market player.  The
Jan/Feb contract saw action between 30.1 and 30.5$/MWh on Friday.  After
jumping to 33$/MWh twice in the early afternoon, LMPs averaged 19.28$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  Temperatures for the early part of the new week were
expected to be nice and cold, with overnight lows in the 20 to 23 degree
range.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from
January 3 to 7.

Spot electricity prices traded down for another day in the Midwest on
Friday, despite an anticipated drop in the mercury for the new week.  Into
Cinergy deals for Monday were seen between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, losing another
buck off the low end and almost two off the high.  The Wednesday picture
looked a little better, trading between 21.75 and 25$/MWh.  Strangely the
winter contract also lost ground on Friday, with transactions heard as low
as 24.4$/MWh.  Cold weather was expected to settle over the Midwest with a
vengeance, with highs for Monday and Tuesday expected in the 17 to 25 degree
range and lows in the frigid single digits.  The most current six-to-ten
predicted below-normal temperatures from January 3 to 7.

Amid very slow trading and colder temperatures expected in the new week,
peak power prices were flat to lower in the Southeast on Friday.  Into
Entergy pieces for Monday delivery were bought and sold from 21.5 to
23$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard around 21.5 to 22$/MWh.  Wednesday
deals were tentatively heard between 23.5 and 25$/MWh.  Into TVA
transactions for New Year's Eve went through from 18.5 to 19.25$/MWh, while
Wednesday saw action slightly higher from 19.9 to 20.1$/MWh.  Overnight lows
were expected in the mid-20s by Monday, with highs in the low-40s.  The
latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 3 to 7.

Day-After Doldrums

Western traders lucky enough to be back in the office the day after
Christmas were greeted by rising day-ahead prices for the Thursday through
Saturday package, largely due to anticipated load increases later in the
week.  Most parties, however, described post-holiday electricity trading on
Wednesday as ""thin and illiquid,"" especially for forward goods.  Some
players also attributed a bit of the daily strength to higher spot gas
prices.  Speaking of gas, NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose sharply in
early Wednesday trade amid forecasts calling for colder weather in the
Midwest and Northeast, but fell late on a rash of profit taking.  January
Hub gas rose to a session high of 3.02$/mmBtu, before profit taking caused
prices to tumble, settling at 2.911$/mmBtu, a rise of 1.6 cents from Friday'
s close.  The January contract expires on Thursday.  February contracts
ended the day 4.8 cents higher at 2.937$/mmBtu.  NYMEX said it would extend
Thursday's session by 15 minutes to 14:45 EST due to the late release of the
AGA inventory report.  Because of the Christmas holiday, the AGA will be
releasing its weekly report at 14:00 PST on Thursday.  Early estimates were
calling for a draw of 50 to 75 bcf last week, well above the 175-bcf draw
seen last year, and the five-year average draw of 140 bcf.  Milder weather
this year has kept withdrawls to a minimum and stocks near historically high
levels.

Some Northwest daily dabblers said that Wednesday trading was relatively
active, ""for the day after Christmas,"" while others said that modest loads
and abundant hydro had most parties well covered for the three-day piece.
Nonetheless, peak power prices for the Thursday through Saturday package
rose as much as 4$/MWh on an anticipated increase in loads later in the
week.  Heavy load energy at the Mid-Columbia traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with
most trades occurring between 23.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  Light load goods rose by
an average of 2.5$/MWh, with confirmed transactions from 19 to 21$/MWh.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained healthy, coming in at 105 kcfs
Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 85 kcfs New Year
's Eve, 50 kcfs New Year's Day, and 100 kcfs next Wednesday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in the
region's major load centers for the first week of the New Year.

Peak power prices for the Thursday/Friday/Saturday package firmed up across
the Golden State on Wednesday.  An increase in off-line megawatts, a lack of
liquidity in thin trading, and sharply increased spot-gas prices were the
biggest factors in the price jump, according to California market players.
Peak-hour prices at California hubs increased from 2.25 to 5.25$/MWh for the
three-day package, but off-peak hours did not necessarily reflect the
increase.  Bucking the statewide trend, off-peak pieces at SP-15 traded
slightly lower than on Friday, ranging from 13.6 to 16.75$/MWh.  Players at
the hub cited ""getting caught with power on our hands that we had no choice
but to sell.""  In the news, on Monday a U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved PG&E
Corp.'s agreement to pay off the $265 million in outstanding power bills to
Calpine Corp.  Starting Monday and continuing through November 2002, PG&E
will make monthly payments of principal and interest to Calpine.  As for
unit news, generation was perhaps the most tumultuous factor in the power
market over the long Christmas weekend.  On Saturday, December 22, there
were 4 new outages, three of which were planned.  Etiwanda #3 and #4 (320 MW
each) came off line on Saturday as planned, as did Duke's 336 MW Morrow Bay
#4.  Helms PGP #3 (404 MW) tripped off line with an unplanned outage but
came back a day later. There were two planned outages on Sunday the 23rd:
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) and Morrow Bay #3 (337 MW), the latter of which came
back on line on Wednesday December 26.  On Christmas Day, Los Medanos (550
MW) was curtailed for the second time in less than a month with an unplanned
outage, and was running at 36% of capacity as of this writing.  The Sutter
Plants (546 MW) were ramping up towards full power, and stood at 525 MW at
11:15am PST Wednesday.

Spot electricity prices in the Southwest displayed the largest gains in the
West on Friday, primarily due to rising spot gas prices, and an expected
increase in loads for later in the week.  Peak power at Palo Verde gained as
much as 6.25$/MWh for the three-day combo, with confirmed trades anywhere
between 26 and 30$/MWh.  Most deals were done on the lower end of that
range, with the highest prices seen late, when a few shorts reportedly
entered the market.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained an average
of 2.75$/MWh to trade from 15.25 to 18.25$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1
(790 MW) finally returned to the grid over the long weekend, after coming
down for tube leak repairs back on December 15.  ""That must have been one
hell of a leak,"" joked one marketer.  The five-day outlook for the Phoenix
area called for daytime highs in the mid to upper 60s, with overnight lows
in the mid to low 40s.  ""Down here 40s seem pretty cold, and they have been
giving us some pretty healthy morning and evening peaks,"" said one Southwest
trader.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal
temperatures in Arizona and normal conditions in New Mexico from January 1
through 5.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

December 26, 2001 for December 27, 2001

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    22.00     0.00    27.00      2.00

Into TVA        24.00     2.00    25.50      3.00
___________________________________________________________
With temperatures across the Eastern Interconnect firmly entrenched in
below-normal territory and increasing numbers of businesses reopening for
the post-Christmas pre-New Year's slack period, day-ahead prices at all
major hubs strengthened over prices seen on Friday.  Nevertheless, many
traders were sitting out the year-end market at home or on vacation, and the
traders manning the daily desks reported few trades at any hubs.  Forecasts
for the entire East called for increased heating demand through the New
Year, though continued healthy generation managed to keep a lid on the
market's high end.  On NYMEX, Henry Hub natural gas contracts nudged up
slightly.  The January contract clung to early gains despite late
profit-taking to close up 1.6 cents at 2.911$/mmBtu, while the February
piece gained 4.8 cents, settling at 2.937$/mmBtu.

Traders at Western PJM reported very light trading their first day back at
work after the Christmas holiday, with prices for Thursday goods fluctuating
slightly between 26 and 26.5$/MWh.  LMPs likewise reflected the quiet
atmosphere on the Eastern seaboard, with power averaging 15.58$/MWh over the
course of the day. The high of 24.2$/MWh was reached between 09:30 and 10:30
EST, where actual load exceeded predictions by a sliver.  Still, prices were
around 1.25-2$/MWh higher than they were on Friday, thanks in large part to
the cooling that has gripped the region.  Temperatures were hovering near
freezing through much of Western PJM, with the five-day forecast calling for
temperatures to remain below normal plus a chance of snow through Sunday
December 30.  The latest six-to-ten echoed the prediction, extending
below-normal temperatures through January 5.  There were no reported unit
outages in PJM on Wednesday.

Temperatures were the leading impulse in ECAR markets on Wednesday, with
highs in the region failing to reach even freezing, and the latest five-day
forecast calling for more of the same plus a chance of snow or snow flurries
from Wednesday through Sunday.  As a result, Into Cinergy pieces traded as
high as 27$/MWh, a two-dollar increase on the high end, but flat on the low
at 22$/MWh.  ""With so few businesses opening over the holiday slack-time,
there just wasn't enough demand to push up prices, despite the colder
weather,"" remarked one trader.  ""But,"" he added, ""more businesses will be
opening as the week drags on, and if this kind of weather continues into the
New Year, we could see some real strength in the market.""  The latest
six-to-ten proved encouraging for such an outcome, calling for temperatures
to remain below normal through January 5.  There were no new unit outages
reported on Wednesday in ECAR.

SERC was no exception to the general condition of the Eastern markets on
Wednesday:  temperatures were well below normal, in many cases below
freezing at night, and demand was light due to the small number of
businesses open between the two big December holidays.  Prices at Into
Entergy showed modest gains, trading between 23.5 and 25.5$/MWh.  ""There
wasn't much going on in Entergy today,"" commented one off-task trader,
""Prices started out at the high end and came down over the course of the day
as some sellers realized they were stuck and had to unload.""  Into TVA
prices likewise strengthened, trading from 24 to 25.5$/MWh on Wednesday.
The five-day forecast predicted temperatures significantly below normal
through Sunday, with snow possible on Thursday and Friday.  The latest
six-to-ten likewise mirrored the rest of the East and called for the
below-normal regime to last through January 5.  There were no new units
reported off-line in SERC on Wednesday.

"Enron Files Chapter 11 Reorganization","To All Employees:

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

        I want to thank you for your cooperation in responding to my previous notice regarding the suspension of our document retention policy.

        In order that we may capture all possible electronic information related to the litigation, please do the following:

        2.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any voice mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6801.

Also, please forward all future e-mails and voice mails that relate to the above-referenced subjects to the appropriate e-mail address or voice mail box.  These procedures will ensure that our electronic documents and voice mails are properly preserved.

        Over the next month, our lawyers will be collecting our traditional files, i.e., written documents, for possible production in litigation.  In the meantime, please retain all of your hard-copy files that in any way relate to:

Elizabeth,

Here is a quick draft at a script to get some broker quotes.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to get firm quotes because our counterparties will not give them to us.  As a consequence, we will only be able to get indicative quotes from brokers.  I am assuming that you are preoccupied with other pressing matters; If I don't hear from you by tomorrow on this, I will distribute this to the term traders, and then we can improve the script later.---sch


Hi,

I'm calling you back to go over the spreadsheet you sent me.  I need to make a record of this.  Could you please spell your name for me and give me your phone number?  And you work at ________?  Great.

I sent you a spreadsheet showing different delivery points and durations for the delivery of power.  Is that right?  

And I asked you to provide indicative market prices for these products?  Is that right?

Were you able to provide some indicative prices?

How did you get those prices?  

Do you believe that these prices accurately and substantially represent market prices at which counterparties would buy and sell power today, November ____, 2001?

Great.  Thank you.

The Return of Enron?

While some Western hubs saw spot electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday
package that were higher than those seen for Thursday power, the bulk of
transactions took place at lower levels due to reduced weekend demand.
Light load goods on the other hand were the real movers of the day thanks to
below-normal temperatures, with all Western hubs gaining ground, especially
late in the session.  ""There were not a lot of off-peak offers out there
today, and we were trying to pick pieces up in order to displace some of our
more expensive gas units,"" said one utility trader to explain Thursday's
light load rally.  The Andersen accounting firm came under heavy fire as
former partner David Duncan refused to testify in Congress on the shredding
of documents related to the Enron collapse by invoking his Constitutional
right not to incriminate himself.  ""Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen
provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel,"" the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., told Duncan.  Meanwhile,
top Andersen executives said that the destruction of documents being sought
by investigators was wrong and largely the fault of Duncan.  UBS-Warburg
took a step towards restarting the acquired North American energy trading
unit of Enron Corp. on Thursday.  UBS management asked all Enron employees
that had accepted offers to attend an impromptu orientation meeting in
Houston.  ""Our goal is to reestablish the business,"" said UBS spokesman
David Walker.  ""The buildup will be measured and focused on customer needs.""
UBS has no intention of buying any of Enron's current trading positions,
which are in the process of being liquidated following Enron's December 2
bankruptcy filing.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were as much as 75 cents higher
than levels seen for Thursday, though most deals got done at a discount to
the previous day.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 18.5 to
19.75$/MWh, with the weighted average coming in somewhere around 18.75$/MWh.
Light load electricity at the Mid-C gained an average of 50 cents for the
weekend package, with most players citing cold overnight temperatures as the
catalyst.  Light load energy changed hands from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed trades heard as high as 18.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Colstrip #3
(700 MW) remained off line for generator repairs, with no available ETR.
According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast
to be 141 percent of normal through the end of the month, with the strongest
demand expected over the first three days of next week.

Heavy load energy prices softened while light load values appreciated in the
Golden State on Thursday.  ""The market seemed unresponsive to factors that
normally affect it today.  Light load was really strong in the south, so
maybe someone got caught short,"" speculated one California player, while
another trader pointed to upcoming outages in the Southwest.  Peak power
prices at NP15 ranged from 22.25 to 23$/MWh, with shaped pieces heard at
23.5$/MWh.  Light load traded between 17.75 and 20.5$/MWh, running up as the
day progressed.  Similarly, Light load at SP15 traded from 18.75 to
20.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed deals heard as low as 16.5$/MWh early.  In
political news, PG&E will face a critical hearing on Friday in bankruptcy
court.  Judge Montali could decide whether the utility can reform into four
separate companies and if key assets like the Diablo Canyon nukes can be
transferred to one of the proposed companies outside the jurisdiction of the
CPUC.  On the generation front, Alamitos #3 (320 MW) was operating at 240 MW
on Thursday, returning to the grid from an outage that began Monday.
Etiwanda #3 (320 MW) was only operating at 20 megawatts Thursday for planned
maintenance.  Mid-state load centers were expecting high temperatures to
remain in the low-50s on Friday, while highs in the mid-60s were anticipated
in L.A.  Slight cooling was projected for the early part of the new week and
the latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 30
to February 3.

Light load energy costs in the Southwest gained as much as 2.5$/MWh for the
Friday/Saturday package, though some players were at a loss to explain why.
""It's cold here, but not that cold, so I'm not really sure why off-peak
prices gained so much momentum late in today's session,"" said one
Phoenix-based trader.  Light load goods at Palo Verde were seen as low as
14.5$/MWh first thing in the morning, then soared all the way up to
18.75$/MWh by the end of trading.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from
20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of trades taking place between 21.25 and
21.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Utah-based Bonanza (425 MW) and Arizona-based
Cholla #4 (380 MW) were off line Thursday morning, but both had returned by
the afternoon.  Utah-based Huntington #2 (455 MW), however, was down with a
tube leak.  While no ETR was available, sources were expecting a 48 to
72-hour turnaround.  Navajo #3 (750 MW) was experiencing vibration problems
on a PA fan.  The Arizona-based unit was scheduled to come down for 24 hours
of repairs beginning after Friday's evening peak.

Amid forecasts calling for cooler weather on Friday and higher gas values
early in the day, peak power prices strengthened across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  ""The front-month picked up about a buck
everywhere, although it came off a little later, but that was the real news
today,"" commented one SERC player.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
up early, but fell in late trade.  February eased 2.8 cents to end at
2.048$/mmBtu, while March lost 0.1 cent to close at 2.09$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed higher in the Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday, on cooler forecasts for Friday.  Western PJM pieces were bought
and sold between 21.85 and 22.75$/MWh.  LMPs spent most of the morning well
above 20$/MWh, but were weaker for most of the afternoon, averaging
21.2$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Daytime highs for Friday were expected in the
cooler, although still above normal, mid-40s.  However, forecasts through
Monday called for temperatures to continue at least 11 degrees above normal
in the PJM region, and the latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 30 to February 3.

With the mercury expected to drop throughout the Ohio Valley on Friday and
rumors of a unit shut late Wednesday, heavy load energy costs edged higher
in the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead goods changed hands
between 17.5 and 18.5$/WMh.  ""Cinergy opened low, but today it climbed
instead of the slow fade we've seen the last few days.  Prices went above
$18 around 8 am, bounced up and down a bit, but stayed up there,"" said one
relieved trader.  The February contract was heard trading between 19.7 and
20.25$/MWh, also stronger than a day ago.  According to sources, a Wisconsin
Electric unit shut late Wednesday, but information on which unit, the cause,
or ETR were not available.  Daytime highs for Friday were only expected to
reach the mid-40s, with corresponding overnight lows expected to drop into
the upper-20s.  The cold snap was anticipated to be short-lived, with
weekend and Monday forecasts putting high temperatures right back into the
upper-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures, with a normal front moving in from the west, from January 30
to February 3.

With continued bearish fundamentals, peak power prices rose incrementally in
the Southeast and Texas on Thursday.  Into Entergy day-ahead deals were done
from 17 t0 17.7$/MWh, while February traded around 19 to 19.1$/MWh for most
of the day, dropping off a little later to 18.9$/MWh.  Into TVA trades
followed a similar pattern, with peak power for Friday delivery averaging
17$/MWh.  SERC forecasts called for highs to fall into the upper-50s on
Friday, before rebounding into the mid-60s for the weekend and upper-60s for
Monday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger close to normal through
Saturday, before rising into the mid-70s by Monday.  The up to the minute
six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January 30 to February
3.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

FERC Calls for Change

Western peak power prices slid substantially on Wednesday, primarily on
reduced holiday-weekend loads.  Players traded a Thursday-through-Saturday
package on Wednesday to accommodate the Christmas holiday on Tuesday,
December 25.  Players will schedule for Sunday and Monday on Thursday, and
for Tuesday and Wednesday on Friday.  No prescheduling will take place in
the WSCC on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  Other factors helping to push
the dailies lower were abundant Northwest hydropower and slightly lower spot
gas prices.  ""Between now and the new year many traders will be out of the
office and loads will remain at holiday levels, so we don't expect much
movement or activity until 2002, barring any sustained cold or unit outages,
of course,"" said one marketer.  While no one can predict the stability of
generating units, forecasters predicted mostly normal and above-normal
temperatures for the entire West through the end of the month.  NYMEX Henry
Hub futures contracts for the front months rose early on end-of-December
forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures in the Midwest and Eastern
U.S., but fell late after another bearish AGA report to finish the day in
negative territory.  January Hub gas shed 4.1 cents to settle at
2.616$/mmBtu, while February fell 6.2 cents to close at 2.65$/mmBtu.
Wednesday's AGA inventory report, delayed more than 20 minutes due to a
computer problem, indicated that U.S. gas stock fell 45 bcf last week, below
most industry estimates, the 158-bcf draw seen a year ago, and the five-year
average decline of 102 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 3.061 tcf, 948
bcf or 45 percent above last year.  Of the 45 bcf taken out last week, six
were drawn from the Consuming Region West.  Total inventories in the West
were reported at 438 bcf, or 87 percent of full.  According to the National
Resources Conservation Service, precipitation throughout much of the West
was at above-normal levels as of Wednesday.  California, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington were all sporting Accumulative
Precipitation Averages well above 100 percent of normal.  However, opinions
varied as to whether or not this trend would continue through the winter
months.  In other industry news, FERC on Wednesday raised its wholesale
electricity price cap for the Western states to 108$/MWh, up from the
previous cap of 92$/MWh.  The increase, in effect through April 30, 2002,
was implemented as a precaution in case of strong demand in the Pacific
Northwest this winter.  The cap is tied to the region's natural gas market,
which means it could be recalculated if natural gas prices change
dramatically, FERC said.  Western traders voiced little enthusiasm about the
new order.

With an overabundance of hydro generation and the inclusion of Saturday in
the three-day package, both on peak and off-peak prices across the Golden
State dipped considerably on Wednesday.  ""With a rainstorm looming off the
California coast, prices had nowhere to go but down,"" commented a Western
player.  Peak power at NP15 was heard trading between 25.5 and 29$/MWh,
shedding a whopping 4 and 5$/MWh at the high and low ends, respectively.
According to a CAISO spokesperson, FERC was expected to issue an order on
Wednesday that would, among other things, ask the CAISO to submit by May 1,
2002 a proposal for redesigning the California market, including the
creation of a day-ahead market.  The CAISO day-ahead market would likely be
an extension of their current real-time market, as opposed to a daily
auction such as the one held by the former CalPX.  In other news, FERC
reopened the inquiry into whether or not El Paso Corp., which owns and
operates four pipelines into California, manipulated the California market
during the supply shortages last winter.  Lastly, SCE told the CPUC that
Enron's service to its California customers was deteriorating, and the
utility urged the commission to decide on an alternate supplier if Enron
fails to meet its obligations.  On the generation front, there was an
additional 2,132 MW off-line in the CAISO control area Wednesday, in
comparison to a day ago.  Gas-fired Moss Landing #6 (739MW) was off-line
Wednesday with no available ETR, while Los Medanos (550 MW) was operating at
230MW, or 42% of capacity.  Although an official ETR was unavailable, rumors
circulated that Sutter Plants (546 MW) would not be back until December 22
at the earliest.  SONGS #3 (1,080 MW) was back at full power Wednesday
following a 100 MW reduction for two days due to a mechanical pump problem.
Forecasts called for near-normal temperatures to continue for the rest of
the week in the Golden State, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted above-normal temperatures from December 25 to 29.

___________________________________________________________
With stronger natural gas prices and colder weather finally setting in,
heavy load energy costs gained ground across the Eastern Interconnect on
Wednesday.  ""It's cooler and cloudy here so demand picked up, but trade is
thinner since many players are already on vacation,"" said one Midwestern
player. The AGA weekly report listed a bearish 45-bcf withdrawal for the
previous week, well below expectations.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
slipped in very late trade, with the front-month contract losing 4.1 cents
to close at 2.616$/mmBtu.  February edged down 6.2 cents to end at
2.65$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, despite a very
healthy generation landscape.  Prices at Western PJM traded in a quarter
spread, up about a buck on both the low and high ends.  Deals were heard in
the 24.9 to 25.15$/MWh range.  The winter contract was trading in a range
from 30.85 to 31.2$/MWh.  Real-time prices were up for the usual morning
peak periods of the day, but after 11:00 EST, they were on a steady decline,
and averaged 17.3$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In weather news, temperatures
were forecast for the mid-40s on Thursday across the East, a few degrees
above normal for late in December.  Much of the same was predicted for the
next five days, with a slim rise in temperatures by the weekend.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from December
25 to 29.

Forecasts for Thursday called for slightly cooler temperatures, lending
strength to heavy load electricity prices in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into
Cinergy pieces changed hands between 20 and 22.4$/MWh, gaining a respectable
1.5$/MWh at both ends.  In political news, FERC approved the MidwestISO as
the East's first RTO, and ordered the competing for-profit entity Alliance
to join it.  FERC has heavily pushed for the formation of RTOs since the
California energy crisis of earlier this year.  FERC hopes the new
organization will boost competition in the region and provide a good example
for the rest of the country.  High temperatures were expected in the 36 to
40 degree range across ECAR on Thursday.  Temperatures were predicted to
linger about five degrees above normal through Sunday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from December
25 to 29.

With highs predominantly in the mid-50s through Sunday and little news
otherwise, day-ahead power prices firmed in the Southeast on Wednesday.
Into Entergy goods were bought and sold between 20.5 and 22$/MWh, while Into
TVA deals were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh, rising about 2 dollars at
both ends.  However, TVA traders said most transactions were completed near
the low end of the range.  Overnight lows for Thursday were expected to be
at or just above freezing across SERC.  The most current six-to-ten called
for below-normal temperatures from December 25 to 29.

Andersen Partners Feel the Heat

Day-ahead peak power prices continued to rise in the Western U.S. Tuesday
amid expectations of stronger weather-related demand and higher natural gas
values.  Some parties also believed that an increase in the amount of
off-line generation had something to do with strengthening the daily market.
Not surprisingly, the real talk of the town on Tuesday surrounded the
ongoing Enron saga.  Enron Corp and Swiss bank UBS Warburg detailed their
agreement on Tuesday to split profits from Enron's trading business.  Under
the terms of the deal, UBS would take over the unit and pay Enron 33 percent
of profits for up to 10 years.  The deal give UBS the right to buy one-third
of Enron's royalty interest in the third year of the deal based on the
previous year's profit.  UBS could buy another third in year four, and the
final third in year five.  The deal still requires approval from Judge
Arthur Gonzales of federal bankruptcy court, which may come at a hearing
scheduled for Friday.  While this was good news for some Enron employees, it
was not all roses for the one-time energy-trading giant on Tuesday.  The
NYSE suspended trading of Enron shares and related securities while it
worked to ""delist"" the stock because of the ""expected protracted nature"" of
Enron's bankruptcy case and the impact it will have on the company's
stockholders.  In our ""if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me"" category,
Andersen fired David Duncan, the lead partner for the Enron audit, on
Tuesday for his alleged role in destroying documents related to its review
of Enorn Corp.'s books.  Andersen said thousands of emails and large numbers
of paper documents related to Enron were destroyed shortly after Duncan
learned on October 23 of a an SEC request for information on the audit of
Enron.  Duncan was scheduled to meet with congressional members on
Wednesday.  In addition to the firing of Duncan, Andersen said it put three
other partners involved in Enron's audit on leave, and four Houston-based
partners were relieved of their management responsibilities.  One market
analyst said of the Enron-Andersen fiasco, ""People are going to go to jail
over all this, but they'll be in good company.""

Peak power prices rose by an average of 75 cents in the Northwest on
Tuesday, largely the result of rising heating demand.  ""Our in-house
forecaster is now saying that the cold weather is going to be more severe
and more prolonged than previously expected,"" claimed one Northwest utility
trader.  Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for
below-normal temperatures across the entire region through January 25.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Tuesday, which surprised
several players since colder weather typically means less runoff and side
flows.  Flows were projected to be 110 kcfs through Thursday, 100 kcfs
Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next
Tuesday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was reportedly back in service
Tuesday, but the returning megawatts were more than offset by a tube leak
outage that occurred at Colstrip #4 (700 MW).  An official ETR for the
Montana-based Colstrip unit could not be obtained, but was presumed to be
between 48 and 72 hours.

Amid stronger natural gas prices at the Southern California border and
colder weather across the state, day-ahead electricity prices strengthened
across the Golden State on Tuesday.  ""Outages are on the rise and the
extended forecasts still look cold,"" explained one California utility
trader.  Peak power deals at NP15 were done from 25 to 28$/MWh, and
balance-of-January contracts were heard from 25.25 to 26.25$/MWh.  SP15
goods for Wednesday delivery were priced below NP15 deals, but by less than
a buck, and BOM was quoted at 26$/MWh.  On the generation front, nuclear
unit Diablo Canyon #2 (1,087 MW) was operating at 50% capacity on Tuesday
for maintenance on the secondary or non-nuclear side of the plant.  It was
expected to ramp back up to full power sometime over the weekend.  As for
gas units, Encina #5 (332 MW) was generating at 290 MW, on its way back from
a planned maintenance outage that started January 11, and Etiwanda #3 (320
MW) powered up to 150 MW, returning from an outage that began December 22.
Temperature forecasts called for highs to reach 64 degrees on Wednesday at
southern load centers, while highs in the mid-50s and upper-40s were
expected at mid-state.  Temperatures were expected to stay two to six
degrees below normal through Saturday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
continued below-normal conditions from January 21 to 25.

Cooler weather and rising spot gas prices gave the daily electricity market
in the Southwest a lift on Tuesday.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded from
23.95 to 27.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard between 25.75 and
26$/MWh.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the desert
region was forecast to average 116 percent of normal through January 22,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS calling for a combination of normal
and below-normal temperatures from January 21 through 25.  In unit news, San
Juan #4 (534 MW) was having trouble retuning from tube-leak repairs that
began on January 10.  The New Mexico-based thermal unit had reportedly
ramped up to about 75 percent of capacity, but an ETR to full was not
available as of this writing.

Amid stronger natural gas values, average peak power prices firmed up across
the Eastern Interconnect again on Tuesday. ""Crude oil prices were up today
which in turn drove natural gas higher, and the dailies rallied on gas
support, especially in the Southeast,"" commented one much-encouraged
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher.  February
climbed 4.1 cents to end at 2.291$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.3 cents to
close at 2.273$/mmBtu.

On the assumption of healthier generation, heavy load energy costs slipped
by less than a dollar in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  ""I'm hearing the
Keystone unit is back, and the Salem outage should be over as well,"" said
one usually accurate PJM source.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery
traded between 22.8 and 23.05$/MWh, and the February contract saw action
from 24.5 to 24.7$/MWh, losing about a dime to a day ago.  The NRC
admonished the operators of Pennsylvania-based nuke Limerick #2 (1,115 MW)
for not having sufficient safety measures in place for a worn-out relief
valve.  The NRC gave the problem a ""white"" rating, their second lowest
classification indicating a low to moderate safety violation, but said they
may conduct further inspections at the plant.  There was no word yet on when
the unit would be off-line for the repair.  Real-time prices were lower on
Tuesday, and averaged 19.85$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  The mercury was
expected to dip on Wednesday, with high temperatures anticipated in the
low-to-mid-40s and low temperatures at or near freezing.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted above-normal temperatures from January 21
to 25.

As weather forecasts for Wednesday projected temperatures about five degrees
above normal, day-ahead peak electricity prices edged up in the Midwest on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 17.75 and 18.75$/MWh, picking
up a quarter on the high end and almost two dollars on the low.  February
saw action from 20.2 to 20.65$/MWh, with the vast majority of deals done at
20.5$/MWh.  In unit news, traders said Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was expected to
exit the grid on Friday for a refueling outage.  The unit has been powering
down since last Wednesday.  High temperatures on Wednesday were forecast to
be in the upper-30s, and corresponding lows were expected in the mid-20s.
The latest six-to-ten called for mostly above-normal conditions, with normal
temperatures in Michigan and Indiana, from January 21 to 25.

With long-awaited strength in the gas market, peak power prices rose in the
Southeast on Tuesday.  Into Entergy deals were heard from 18.95 to
22.35$/MWh.  Traders said the front-month contract rallied, driven mostly by
the dailies, with transactions completed between 19.3 and 19.6$/MWh.  Into
TVA pieces were bought and sold from 20 to 21.5$/MWh.  Temperatures were
expected near normal to slightly above normal through Saturday, with lows
only forecast in the upper-30s to low-40s.  The most current six-to-ten
called for above-normal temperatures from January 21 to 25.

Crazy Caught in California

Peak power prices for Thursday delivery were mostly lower across the West
Wednesday on revised weather forecasts and lower spot gas prices.  On
Tuesday, some forecasts were calling for Arctic air to descend upon northern
areas of the WSCC in the coming days, but on Wednesday most forecasts were
toting less severe warnings.  ""A day ago they were saying we would get hit
by a blast of Arctic air, and now they are saying we will get some cooler
air, but not of the Arctic variety,"" said one Northwest utility trader.  The
revised forecasts also helped to lower balance-of-the-month contract costs
at all of the major Western hubs.  ""I was shocked that the dailies and the
balance traded lower today, we were expecting at least a little upside after
yesterday's session,"" said one surprised marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas
contracts settled lower Wednesday despite a supportive AGA inventory report,
largely due to concerns surrounding high storage levels.  February and March
Hub gas contracts fell 5.3 cents each to settle at 2.228 and 2.232$/mmBtu,
respectively.  Wednesday's AGA report indicated that 190 bcf were pulled out
of storage last week, well above industry estimates calling for a 175-bcf
draw.  Total U.S. inventories stand at 2.666 tcf, 1.014 tcf, or 71 percent
of full.  Of the 190-bcf drawn last week only seven were taken from the
Western Consuming Region.  Total Western stocks stand at 407 bcf, or 81
percent of full.  Western stocks were at 277 bcf on the same week last year,
and have averaged 313 bcf over the past five years.  In news of the weird, a
recently fired employee of California nuclear power plant San Onofre (2,150
MW total) was arrested on Wednesday for making death threats against his
former boss and coworkers.  Law enforcement investigators found over 200
guns, rifles, and munitions in his home and more when they searched a nearby
storage locker.  Two officers were briefly hospitalized after inhaling an
unknown yellow gas released from a canister in the storage locker.
Officials said the arrest was not terrorist-related, and with the suspect in
custody no further threat was posed to the power plant.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher on
Wednesday, to the surprise of many.  On Tuesday, regional forecasts were
revised to reflect the anticipated arrival of Arctic air, which pushed the
dailies higher.  Wednesday brought about another forecast revision, this
time in the opposite direction.  While longer-term forecasts continued to
call for below-normal temperatures for much of the region, the extent of the
cooling was not expected to be as severe as previously anticipated.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised slightly lower on Wednesday, coming
in at 75 kcfs through Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs
Monday, and 85 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  The lower flows partly
reflected the return of cooler temperatures, which have curtailed recent
snowmelt, reducing side flows in turn.  On the topic of water, the Northwest
River Forecast Center slightly lowered its runoff forecast for this year at
some of the region's large Columbia River Dams.  Nonetheless, it appeared
likely that the Northwest would still have much healthier water levels in
2002 compared to last year's ""drought-like"" conditions.  April through
September supplies at Grand Coulee were forecast to be 94 percent of normal,
while The Dalles was expected to be about 93 percent of normal for the same
period.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) tripped late Tuesday or early
Wednesday due to a suspected tube leak, and was reportedly given a 48-hour
turnaround time.

Day-ahead electricity prices were mostly lower in California on Wednesday
amid warmer weather for much of the state.  NP15 and SP15 traded almost flat
to each other, while COB traded about two dollars lower.  Balance of January
at NP15 slipped with the rest of the West on Wednesday, trading between 20.5
and 22.5$/MWh and losing its premium over the day-ahead prices.  In
political news, the CPUC said they wanted more input in the PG&E
reorganization proposal.  Specifically, the commission thinks parent PG&E
Corp. should be required to invest a more substantial stake in the repayment
process.  The FERC judge who originally ruled in favor of El Paso Corp.
officially reopened the anti-competitive case against the energy firm,
saying new evidence could make him change his recommendation.  The company
was accused of withholding transmission on its natural gas pipelines into
California during last year's energy crisis.  In unit news, Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) was operating at 300 MW on Wednesday for planned reasons.  There
was talk that one of the two Intermountain units (820 each) was coming off
this weekend for annual maintenance, while other sources said it wasn't
exiting the grid until early February, but no official word was available as
of this writing.  Above-normal temperatures were expected to continue on
Thursday, with forecasts calling for highs in the mid-50s to mid-60s at
mid-state load centers, and in the low-70s in the south.  Highs in the Bay
area were expected to drop about ten degrees on Friday, but otherwise little
change was expected in the Golden State through Sunday.  The most current
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

It was a buyers market in the Southwest on Wednesday, with several players
reporting that sellers were coming out of the woodwork.  ""We tried to sell
early, but everyone told us to call back if we needed any power.  Later on
we did call some people back because prices fell below the marginal costs of
some of our less-efficient units,"" said one Arizona-based trader.  Daytime
highs in Phoenix hit 81 degrees on Tuesday, while overnight lows were
hovering mainly in the 50s.  Utilities were still seeing loads pick up in
the late evening and early morning hours, but the patterns were said to be
more reminiscent of spring than winter.  In unit news, Four Corners #5 (750
MW) was still operating at 550 MW on Wednesday due to an air preheater
problem.  The New-Mexico based unit was scheduled to come down for annual
maintenance on January 15, and not return until March 14.  Weather forecasts
called for above-normal temperatures though the week in the region's major
load centers, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was prediction normal
temperatures from January 15 through 19.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 9, 2002 for January 10, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    18.50    -1.05    20.50     -0.75
Western PJM     22.50    -1.70    23.50     -1.35

___________________________________________________________
Amid above-normal temperatures, the expectation of further warming on
Thursday, and softer natural gas prices, heavy load electricity prices
slipped across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  ""The weather outlook
is bearish right now, and gas dropped about 8 or 9 cents pretty much across
the board, so February fell off and the dailies took a hit as well,"" said
one Midwestern trader.  The AGA storage report listed a bullish withdrawal
of 190 bcf, mostly from the Eastern Consuming Region.  Despite the
supportive AGA, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures fell on Wednesday.
February lost 5.3 cents to close at 2.228$/mmBtu, while March also fell 5.3
cents to end at 2.232$/mmBtu.

Forecasts for warming temperatures were the main culprits bringing PJM
day-ahead power prices lower on Wednesday, despite strong real-time prices
for much of the morning and a key coal unit outage.  Pennsylvania-based
Homer City #1 (620 MW) reportedly came off-line late Tuesday with a header
crack, and was expected to remain down until February 6.  Sources also said
coal-fired Conemaugh #2 (850 MW) was out of service on Wednesday, although
no official confirmation was available.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 22.5 and 23.6$/MWh, down over a dollar to a day ago.  February was
heard trading between 25 and 25.5$/MWh, down at least fifty cents, mostly on
weaker gas and warmer weather. LMPs averaged 32.4$/MWh through 14:00 EST,
after plateauing above 70$/MWh for almost an hour starting at 09:40 EST.
Temperatures were expected to reach highs in the 50s on Thursday, with lows
in the 38 to 41 degree range.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

Peak power prices weakened in the Midwest again on Wednesday, dragged down
by the same factors affecting the rest of the Eastern electricity market;
namely warmer weather and weaker gas.  Into Cinergy pieces for Thursday
delivery slipped about a buck, trading between 18.4 and 20.5$/MWh.  ""Dailies
were low for most of the day, but cracked into the 20s late, which is a
typical trading pattern,"" remarked one Cinergy player.  February also edged
down about 75 cents, with deals heard between 21.5 and 21.75$/MWh.  Weather
conditions were predicted to be mild on Thursday, with high temperatures in
the mid-40s and lows in the upper-30s.  The most current six-to-ten called
for normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

Warm weather, weak demand, and soft gas placed downward pressure on the
Southeastern electricity market Wednesday, but the Entergy dailies ended
higher anyway, with some shorts bidding prices up late.  Into Entergy goods
were bought and sold between 18.75 and 23$/MWh, while Into TVA deals were
done from 19.25 to 20.25$/MWh.  In political news, the PJM Interconnection
applied to become the operator of the proposed SeTrans RTO in the
Southeastern U.S. on Wednesday.  High temperatures were expected to rise
into the low-60s on Thursday, before dropping back into the 50s for the rest
of the week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from
January 15 to 19.

"Grant valuation of Nonfirm hydro","Jeff -

Here is a first cut at valuing the Grant's non firm power from Priest Rapid and Wanapum hydro projects.  We assumed a term from 1/1/02 - 10/31/05.  We assumed a price curve of Mid Columbia (thus we have included no transmission costs).  Enron also assumed a payment to Grant due on 1/1/02.  The last important assumption is how to value any ""negative firm"" power (defined as a situation in which Grant's non firm power in one month is lower than the critical year monthly figure).  In this situation we carried over the negative water volume to the next month and net is against positive volumes.  

The total value to nonfirm power using the above assumptions is approximately $68 million.  If Grant is interested in a $15 million lump sum then Enron would assume a 22% stake in the non firm hydro stream.

Briefly I would like to explain our methodology for valuing the hydro.  We took the hydro raw data from Grant on the two projects and also used the critical year assumption.  In addition we created a curve to reflect the impact of water to power prices (ie the greater the water volume the lower the power prices).  We then ran a number of simulations to create a distribution that describes the range of output values.

Jeff I look forward to speaking with you about this in more detail. You can reach me at 503-464-3810.  As I mentioned I will be out this week from Tuesday to Friday.

West Up, But Outlook Bearish

Most peak power prices in the West rose slightly for Tuesday delivery amid
unplanned unit outages and rising spot gas prices.  Nonetheless, most
traders said the strength would have been more prominent had it not been for
rain-boosted flows in the Northwest, and near-seasonal temperatures
throughout much of the WSCC.  With holiday loads fast approaching and
longer-term weather forecasts calling for a mild end for the month, it was
not surprising that most balance-of-December contracts were on the decline
Monday.  Despite a stronger cash market, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
contracts declined Monday on forecasts calling for near-seasonal
temperatures, as well as some technical selling.  January Hub gas shed 16
cents to close at 2.686$/mmBtu, while February fell 14.7 cents to end at
2.761$/mmBtu.  Early estimates for Wednesday's AGA inventory report called
for a 20 to 80-bcf draw last week, well below the 158-bcf draw seen a year
ago, and the five-year average draw of 102 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories
stand at 3.106 tcf, or 37 percent above last year.  ""We expect the storage
spread between this year and last to grow considerably in the next few
weeks, because last year we had huge draws due to sustained below-normal
temperatures, something that seems all too unlikely this year,"" said one gas
trader.  On a political note, Representative Joe Barton from Texas announced
the postponement of an electricity deregulation bill before Congress until
February.  The busy holiday season was cited as the reason, but most summed
it up to the nervousness from the Enron collapse.

Heavy load energy costs for Tuesday rose only marginally in the Northwest,
while light load goods were seen on the decline.  Seasonable temperatures
and recent heavy rains were prime culprits leading to the lackluster daily
market.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia traded from 27.25 to 29.5$/MWh, with
the lowest prices reported out of the gate.  Light load goods saw action
anywhere between 17 and 24.25$/MWh, though most trades were done on the high
end of the spectrum, from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Flows remained healthy in the
rain-soaked region, with Chief Joseph forecast to see 90 kcfs Tuesday and
Wednesday, 95 kcfs Thursday and Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 45 kcfs Sunday,
and 90 kcfs on Christmas Eve.  When asked, most players believed that the
Christmas Eve flows were a mistake, and would be reduced in a future report.
In unit news, Colstrip #1 (330 MW) was brought down for scheduled
maintenance on Saturday, but was back in service 24 hours later.  Weather
forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip
slightly through the week, but not into below-normal territory, while the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting above-normal temperatures for
the entire region from December 23 through 27.

With much activity on the generation front and stronger spot natural gas
prices, heavy load electricity prices across the Golden State edged up on
Monday.  ""Prices were generally floating down from the high end but bounced
around a bit as the day progressed.  In terms of the long-range forecasts,
it is not particularly strong,"" commented one trader.  At SP15, heavy load
electricity prices traded in a larger range on Monday, from 32 to
35.25$/MWh.  Off-peak prices were also seen on a wider scale, ranging from
24.5 to 28.4$/MWh.  Spot gas prices at the SoCal border were also stronger
on Monday, trading between 2.74 and 2.79$/mmBtu, up about 14 cents from
Friday.  In unit news, SP15-based El Segundo #4 (335 MW) went off-line
unexpectedly on Monday.  Gas-fired Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was back at full
power on Monday following a planned maintenance outage that began on
November 3.  The weather forecast for Tuesday called for normal conditions
with highs in the upper 60s in the south and mid-50s in the north.
Overnight lows were expected to reach the mid-40s across the entire state.
The five-day forecast called for little change as the week progressed.  The
latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures from
December 23 to 27.

An unexpected unit outage and rising spot gas prices helped to prop up
prices in the Southwest on Monday, albeit slightly.  Mohave #1 (790 MW) was
taken off line Saturday for tube leak repairs, and was given an ETR of
""December 19 or 20.""  Being that we are talking about a Mohave unit, one
should err on the side of caution and go with the 20th.  Some parties said
the Mohave outage had little to do with the slightly higher prices, given
that it was more than offset by the weekend returns of two 750 MW units,
Four Corners #4 and Navajo #3.  Further to the north, Colorado-based Craig
#1 (428 MW) was brought down Saturday for unplanned repairs, with no ETR
given.  There were also unconfirmed reports that San Juan #3 (534 MW) was
operating near 50% on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded from 29 to
33.75$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done at the 33$/MWh mark.  Weather
forecasts called for seasonable temperatures through the week, while the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting a mix of normal and
below-normal temperatures from December 23 through 27.  ""Below-normal
temperatures in the Southwest this time of year could mean some higher
off-peak prices, but little more,"" said one industry soothsayer.

Amongst a healthier generation landscape and continued well above-normal
daytime highs, Monday's day-ahead electricity prices across the Eastern
Interconnect firmed up slightly on the low end, but softened for the most
part on the high.  ""We don't expect to see a whole lot of deviation in
prices until after the New Year,"" remarked one Eastern trader.  Spot natural
gas prices were stronger on Monday amid stronger weather related demand due
to a return to more normal like weather conditions later in the week.  In
the gas market, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures tumbled substantially on
Monday.  The January contract fell 16 cents, while February also lost a
similar 14.7 cents.

Spot electricity prices across the Mid-Atlantic on Monday were mostly steady
to Friday, trading up forty cents on the high end.  Western PJM pieces
changed hands between 23.75 to 24.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going
through at 24$/MWh.  LMPs plateaued at almost 36$/MWh from 10:00 to 11:00
EST, before settling down to the day's average of 19.86$/MWh through 15:00.
In generation news, almost 2,000 MW returned to the grid over the weekend,
adding more supply to a still weak demand.  On the weather front,
temperatures for the Mid-Atlantic were expected to cool dramatically as the
week progressed.  Daytime highs for Tuesday were expected in the mid-50s,
about ten degrees above normal for this time of year.  By Friday, conditions
were expected to return to more seasonal levels for December.  The most
current six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from
December 23 to 27.

With the return of a large unit to an already plentiful supply picture,
day-ahead power prices settled slightly lower on Monday in the Midwest.
Into Cinergy goods were bought and sold between 17.9 and 18.65$/MWh, with
the majority of transactions done from 18.2 to 18.4$/MWh.  Traders said
balance-of-the-week deals were being done right around 19$/MWh, with next
week trading 25 to 50 cents lower on lighter loads for the holiday.  On the
unit front, Michigan-based nuke Fermi #2 (1,085 MW) returned to service over
the weekend from its fall refueling outage, although whether it was
operating at full capacity or still ramping up on Monday afternoon could not
be confirmed.  ""Weather-wise, the worst is behind us this week,"" commented
one hopeful seller.  Tuesday forecasts called for highs in the
low-to-mid-40s and lows in the mid-30s, while the rest of the week was
expected to become progressively colder.  The latest six-to-ten predicted
below-normal temperatures from December 23 to 27.

Amid weak weather-related demand, but despite stronger spot gas prices,
heavy load electricity prices weakened across the Southeast and traded in a
narrower range on Monday.  Into Entergy prices gained fifty cents on the low
end, trading at 18$/MWh, while prices slipped seventy-five cents on the high
end to finish the day at the 20$/MWh mark.  Into TVA prices were seen in a
fifty cent range from 18.25 to 18.75$/MWh.  In generation news, South
Carolina Oconee #3 (847MW) returned to full capacity sometime over the
weekend.  Tuesday's highs for the Southeast were expected to range from the
mid-50s to the high-60s, still well above normal for the last remaining
weeks of the year.  The five-day forecast called for gradual cooling.  The
latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures to blanket the region
from December 23 to 27.

"Enron Elves","In this incredibly difficult time, giving to others may seem implausible, if not impossible.  It can, however, lighten our burden as we help others.  

After much thought, we have decided to go forward with our Enron Elves Event. In partnership with the Salvation Army, we have adopted three underprivileged families. Enron Elves is an opportunity to provide gifts for children who would otherwise go without.   

The official Enron Elves Tree has been erected and will soon be adorned with holiday gift tags.  Each gift tag contains a gift idea for a child.  

If you would like to participate in Enron Elves, here's what you do:
?	Take a candy cane gift tag from the tree
?	Sign your name to one side of the folded gift tag and place the signed tag in the box by the tree 
?	The other gift tag needs to come back attached to the wrapped gift 
?	Bring the wrapped gift and place it under the tree

All gifts need to be wrapped and under the tree by December 18.  We will then hold a prize drawing, including Blazer Basketball tickets, for those employees who participated.  

Thank you for considering those in need during this holiday season.

"AURORA Version 6.0","AURORA has recently released Version 6.0.  I have attached a PDF that
explains AURORA's new feature.  I have also included below a copy of our
latest press release.  For any additional questions that you may have
please contact me.

 <<What's new - Version 6 Information.pdf>> 
EPIS Announces North American Electricity Market Software and Database
for Forecasting Wholesale Electricity Prices 

AURORATM V6 Electric Market Model, proven leading-edge software package,
released with ready-to-use data for all the reliability regions in North
America to forecast wholesale electricity market prices.  AURORA
delivers the speed for forecasting market prices and modeling
uncertainty using multi-driver Monte Carlo simulations including random
resource outages with random frequency and duration.

PORTLAND, Oregon-December 4, 2001-EPIS, Inc., developer of pace-setting
software for the electric-power industry, today announced the release of
the North American Electricity Market Database and Version 6 of its
market modeling software, AURORA*. 
Already the fastest tool of its kind, AURORA delivers the critical
dispatch speed for risk analysis--modeling uncertainty using
multi-driver Monte Carlo simulations.  This swiftness, coupled with
market-simulated capacity-expansion logic, frees up time for the model
to consider more resource options in producing revenue forecasts for
asset valuations. 
AURORA and its North American electric market database simulate
electricity imports and exports to produce price forecasts for market
areas and trading hubs.  New Version 6 features include simulating
random resource outages and expressing inputs and outputs in
international units of choice.  AURORA models random forced outages for
resources and the random frequency and duration of resource outages.
This new outage approach allows units to fail or return to service at
any time during the simulation.  AURORA input and output may be in any
currency, or any unit for expression of fuel heat content, heat rate
heat content and emission quantity. The newly released database greatly
reduces the research and data collection time to produce accurate
electric market price forecasts for all the reliability regions in the
United States and Canada.
""Delivery of ready-to-use energy data for all the markets in North
America is unique to the AURORA electric market model.  We are putting
powerful forecasting capability into the hands of energy professionals,
dramatically increasing their understanding of forces behind electricity
prices,"" said Warren H. Winter, EPIS President.
Resource developers use AURORA to determine the value of existing- and
future-generation units.  They also use AURORA to understand the
underlying drivers of the forecasts--invaluable information for power
marketers and resource developers and planners.  Energy traders use
AURORA to forecast hourly, on-peak and off-peak electric prices for
trading hubs.  AURORA gives them immediate access to the resource
dispatch stacks and electricity price forecasts of day and forward
trading.  Also, gas traders use AURORA to forecast gas demand from
electric generation for gas trading. 
A Windows-based model, AURORA runs on Pentium class computers under
Windows XP/2000/NT 4.0/ME/and /98/.  Complete electricity pricing
results are available in a matter of seconds or minutes, rather than
hours or days, and do not require lengthy set-up or run times.
AURORA V6 is being delivered to current customers of EPIS, including
major North American electric-energy providers, utilities, consultants,
and agency and planning groups.
For more information about AURORA contact EPIS at (503) 722-2023 or
visit www.epis.com.
EPIS, Inc., based in Portland, Oregon, provides information on
electric-energy prices and market value by applying fundamental economic
principles to the emerging competitive energy market.  The company is
the developer of the AURORA electric market model, uses AURORA to
produce market forecasts, and supports clients who use AURORA to
forecast and analyze the energy marketplace.

Hey,

I'd like to know if I could buy you a beer sometime and pick your brain on how things work in the NW term trading world.  I'm one of the NW mid-marketers now (4 of us total) and I'd like to know in advance how to best work with you, add value, and not be a pain in your ass.  Let me know if this is OK.  You pick the time & place.

Thanks!

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

"Summertime Amsterdam Update","Greetings from Amsterdam.....

A few things that I have to follow up on from previous updates:

The APB (All Points Bulletin) on Kevin Watler's bike was cancelled last
month....and the reward went unclaimed.  He found the bike himself.
Amnesia?  Senility?  We'll know soon enough.  But on the other hand, I have
had three bikes stolen in an eight week span.  So right now I have no bike,
and it's pissing me off.  I thought I lived in a nice neighborhood,
obviously I was sadly mistaken, Bike thieves are running rampant on the
Keizersgracht!  Visitors Beware......

There has been a fair amount of drinking going on in Amsterdam this
summer.....here are some highlights....

Doug, Kevin Watler and Tinhead left a club in Sweden got in a cab and ended
up in Copenhagen, Denmark.  I'm pretty sure the cab driver ripped us off,
but I was involved, so that shouldn't surprise anyone.  One plus...we saw a
beautiful sunrise.

Simon left the Supper Club a few weeks ago and was later found by Watler
laying on his back on a canal bridge and singing to himself....I wasn't
there, but the rumor is he was singing, ""It's Raining Men"".  But you didn't
hear that from me....

Three weeks ago most of the German Electricity Desk took out clients to the
Okura Hotel for sushi.  We all brought dates, my date was not impressed,
I'll tell you why.....for starters, we all got bombed on hot Sake.  After
dinner we were started on cocktails.  We all decided to go to the Supper
Club for some more drinks.  I got up to go to the bathroom before we left.
Unfortunately....I walked into a wall instead.  So surprisingly enough I got
into the cab that was going to Keizersgracht 393, not the cab that was going
to the Supper Club with Simon.  In hind sight I think I made the right
call.....(see story above about Simon, same night!!!)

Eric Pierce has been having trouble riding his bike drunk this summer.  He
recently has ridden into the tram tracks and flipped over his handle bars.
A stunt that should not be attempted stone cold sober, let alone under the
influence of alcohol.....on a another occasion, he drove his bike into a
wall.   Kathryn and I are discussing the possibility of putting training
wheels on his bicycle....I'll let you know what we decide.

Speaking of bike riding....Kevin and Missy were riding back from a bar and
it started pouring down rain, I mean pouring!  So they stopped by my
apartment to get out of the rain, I was in Corsica but Eric and Katherine
were there.  Apparently the four of them found the my robe and the guest
robes and had a ""Robe Party"".  I'm hoping to hear the real story before I
die......I'm not holding my breath.  

Shockingly enough that was not the last party to be had at my apartment in
my absence....

Missy and I cooked a dinner party for twelve people two weeks ago at my
place.  I'm pretty sure everyone would agree that it was a huge success.
Only one little slip up....Missy and I forgot to serve our guests the green
tea ice cream we made from scratch that afternoon.  But don't worry, we
didn't forget to ""meet"" in the kitchen between courses and eat the ice cream
ourselves......oh yeah, we planned that the whole time.  Anyway, I passed
out at about midnight, from what I was told the party, ended at about 3:30
in the morning.

A very similar thing happened last Saturday night, but then again all of
last week was a little out of control.  I'll leave last weeks stories
(antics) for the next update, trust me, they are worth the wait....

I have an update from the human resources department....

Eric Pierce and Kathryn Adamson (engaged to be married) moved over here from
New Zealand.  He is working on the French Desk and running the Continental
Options Desk.   If anyone remembers, they are the couple I visited for New
Year's Eve in New Zealand in 1997-1998.  Anyway, they are part of the
Amsterdam Prebon Team now....

Also, I can't believe it, but I have MORE baby announcements.....Welcome to
the world, Peter Travers, Madeline (my cousin Tammy's daughter), Alex
Chandler, and the Halstead Twins (girls, I haven't heard their names
yet)......I am very behind in the gifts department, I'm thinking I'll start
sending the gifts as soon as the kids can thank me themselves.

Also, I just planned this today.......I am coming to New York for the
Weekend of August 17th and 18th.  I have a croquet tournament on Saturday
and Saturday night.  But since I never get to see everyone when I come
home....I'm throwing a party Friday night.  I'm starting it early, so
everyone with weekend plans can at least stop by, say hello, and split if
they want to.  I'm throwing it at McFadden's (Elvis, email me right away
please) and if I'm lucky we might just have the Nancy Luca Band there....!
For all that can make it, I'll be at McFadden's (42nd Street and 2nd Avenue)
from about 4:30pm on....so please stop by, you won't regret it.

That's about it from Europe, I hope to see a lot of you one week from
Friday....!

-Douglas Pursel Moore

Dreaming of a Wet Christmas

As reduced holiday demand prepared to firmly grip the U.S., peak power
prices for delivery on Sunday and Christmas Eve fell sharply throughout the
West on Thursday.  The most notable declines were seen in the southern half
of the WSCC as temperatures remained at or just above normal levels, while
much of the Northwest and Northern California combated increasing heating
demand.  ""Lower spot gas prices may have played a role in softening the
dailies, but holiday loads are the main market-moving force,"" admitted one
trader.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose Thursday on forecasts
calling for end-of-the-month cold in the Midwest and Northeast, though most
players believed that weak holiday demand would limit the upside in the near
term.  January Hub gas, which expires next Thursday, rose 7 cents to close
at 2.686$/mmBtu, and February gained 5.8 cents to end at 2.708$/mmBtu.  ""The
forecasted cold for the eastern half of the U.S. may well have pushed Henry
Hub prices much higher had it not been for the glut of gas currently in
storage,"" said one gas watcher.  Over the past several weeks, the Western
U.S. has led the nation in inventory withdrawls, largely due to colder
weather in the region relative to the rest of the nation.  Several sources
indicated that the ""strong Western draws"" were due in part to a large number
of unit outages, especially at coal-fired plants, which increased the demand
for natural gas.  The recent return of more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired
generation, however, will likely reduce demand for natural gas going
forward.  Natural gas demand will likely be reduced further by the recent
precipitation.  Not only does the heavy precipitation lend to stronger hydro
generation now, but higher snow-pack will likely boost hydro output when the
spring runoff takes place.  ""All these factors lead me to believe that the
demand for gas-fired generation in the West will remain weak well into
 2002,"" said one market analyst.

Heavy load energy costs for Christmas Eve delivery fell by an average of
3.25$/MWh in the Northwest on Thursday, but the decline was limited by
colder temperatures across much of the region.  Peak power at the
Mid-Columbia traded in a relatively narrow range from 19 to 21$/MWh, while
light load goods for the all-day Sunday/off-peak Christmas Eve package were
seen in an even tighter range between 17 and 18$/MWh.  ""I'm not sure why
they treated Christmas Eve as a peak power day.  I don't know anyone who
will be working on Monday,"" said one baffled trader.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong amid recent heavy precipitation, coming in at
95 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 75 kcfs Christmas Eve, 60
kcfs Christmas Day, and 90 kcfs next Wednesday and Thursday.  Recent heavy
rains have all but quashed a year-long drought in the region.  With the
shortest day of the year upon us, Portland, Oregon was enjoying its 32nd day
of continuous rain.  That leaves only three more days of Mother Nature's
revenge to break the record of 34 days. Precipitation since October 1 has
ranged from 124 to 143% of normal in the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada
Mountains.  Canadian precipitation is back on track too, with snow-pack
levels in the Columbia River drainage at or above normal.  Last year's
drought, frigid weather, and market panic are merely distant memories.

Peak power prices for the Sunday-Monday package weakened across the Golden
State on Thursday in what marketers described as a ""cold, wet, uneventful
trading day.""  The all-day Sunday/off-peak Monday piece lost ground at every
California hub, with SP-15 the biggest mover.  ""There's just no demand over
the holidays, especially with this mild weather,"" lamented one overstocked
seller.  Above-normal precipitation and temperatures in the low 50s to
mid-60s were the most-oft cited targets for blame, according to market
players.  The five-day forecast called for temperatures in the western
portions of California to be near or slightly below normal, while the
eastern portions were expected to be slightly above normal.  Rain was
predicted for the coastal and lowland regions, with snow called for in the
mountains.  The latest six-to-ten suggested that temperatures would fall
below normal from December 26 to 30.  In unit news, gas-burner Los Medanos
(550 MW) had already powered up to 530 MW following an unplanned outage, and
Contra Costa #7 (337 MW) was ramping down for a planned maintenance outage.
It had powered down to 45 MW as of the CAISO's 11:15 report.

Relatively mild weather and meek holiday demand prompted spot electricity
prices in the Southwest to make the sharpest declines in the West on
Thursday.  Peak power for Christmas Eve fell by as much as a whopping
6.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, with confirmed trades heard anywhere between 22.25
and 25$/MWh.  A very late trade reported at 29.25$/MWh was no more than an
anomaly.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub traded narrowly between 14
and 16$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (739 MW) was still scheduled to return
from the dead at 22:00 MST Thursday, but even unit participants were taking
a wait-and-see attitude.  Further to the north, Utah-based Hunter #2 (472
MW) had its return pushed back until at least Christmas Day.  Weather
forecasts called for temperatures in Phoenix to hover within a few degrees
of normal through the long holiday weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was predicting a mix of normal and below-normal conditions across
the desert region from December 26 through 30.

Amid light pre-holiday trading and higher natural gas prices, day-ahead
electricity prices were mixed across the Eastern Interconnect on Thursday.
With many traders already off for the holiday and light loads expected to
continue through the end of the year, volume was particularly thin and
prices were seen in tight ranges.  ""There's a piece trading here and there,
but for the most part business is done until January,"" said one PJM trader.
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures climbed on Thursday, with the January
contract gaining 7 cents to close 2.686$/mmBtu and the February contract
following suit with a 5.8 cent gain to close at 2.708$/mmBtu.

Despite less generation on-line than a day ago, peak power prices settled
lower on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic.  ""Some plants are off to give
everyone a holiday break, which is possible because the weather's not
expected to do much,"" said one ready-to-leave PJM player.   Western PJM
heavy-load goods traded between 24.25 and 24.5$/MWh, slipping 65 cents at
both ends.  Light load deals for Friday delivery were heard from 16.75 to
17$/MWh.  LMPs spiked to an unusually hefty 100$/MWh briefly at 08:00 and
again just before 09:00 EST, before settling back near the day's average of
23.06$/MWh through 14:00 EST.  Forecasts in the Mid-Atlantic called for
temperatures to linger within 5 degrees of seasonal levels.  Friday highs
were expected in the 41 to 48 degree range, with overnight lows just below
freezing.  Low temperatures were predicted to warm into the low-40s by
Christmas Eve.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for near to
below-normal temperatures from December 26 to 30.

In sparse dealing, heavy load electricity prices in the Midwest fell off a
bit on Thursday, as weather, loads, and the attitudes of those still stuck
at work on Friday were expected to be bearish.  Into Cinergy goods changed
hands between 20.75 and 21.75$/MWh, gaining 75 cents on the low end and
losing almost the same off the high to settle into a dollar spread.  No new
unit information was available on Thursday.  High temperatures were expected
mostly in the 40s through Sunday, while cooling into the mid-30s was
predicted for Christmas Eve, boosting the hopes of those still dreaming of a
white Christmas.  The most current six-to-ten-day forecast called for near
to below-normal temperatures from December 26 to 30.

Peak power prices strengthened in the Southeast on Thursday for the third
day in a row, as colder weather forecasts and higher natural gas prices
rallied the dailies.  Into Entergy deals were done between 22 and
23.25$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions near 22.75$/MWh.  Into TVA trading
was much lighter, with pieces being bought and sold between 21 and 22$/MWh.
Although no official word was heard, traders thought Catawba #2 (1,129 MW)
remained down.  High temperatures were expected to range from 47 to 57
degrees through Christmas Eve, with overnight lows in the mid-30s to
low-40s.  The latest six-to-ten called for near to below-normal temperatures
from December 26 to 30.

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"I'm a real racing driver now Mike!","Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;
 
We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)

Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.
