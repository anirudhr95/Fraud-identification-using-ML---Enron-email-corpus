He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury.   Reggie Kelly , TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. ! He! won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11.   Chad Lewis , TE PHI - AARP Updated 11/19/01 Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.   Packers , DT GB - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/19/01 Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tenne! ss! ean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day.   Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Hollowman Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Threesome Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantasy value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel , WR DET - AARP Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy team! s,! and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Road Rage Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - AARP Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

 	 	    Dear Jason,  Today in Washington, D.C., the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee voted against a proposal to force the FERC to impose price caps in the West.  D.C. bureau correspondent Peter Cook says tomorrow the bureau is following up on the fallout from today's failed effort by Democrats to force the price caps issue.  Peter also says tomorrow they'll bring us the latest leaks from next week's scheduled White House Energy Task Force recommendations.      From the Houston bureau tomorrow, ENL's Gale Smith says AES New Energy's Corby Whitaker is scheduled to be in studio.  He'll update us on how AES is doing so far in the Texas electricity deregulation pilot program.  Gale says Whitaker will also give us details as to how many retail businesses have signed up, and what the future holds for AES New Energy.  Houston correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to give us an update on crude storage in the Gulf of Mexico.  Kim says the U.S. Coast Guard and the Federal Minerals Management Services are close to approving rules allowing ships to store crude while anchored in the Gulf.  We'll bring you all the details on these and other stories from Houston tomorrow.          As promised, I have information on ENL's trip to Alaska.  The Houston bureau's Gale Smith is frantically digging out warmer clothes as she prepares to go to Anchorage Monday and Tuesday to cover the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  The IOGCC represents 37 governors from states that produce most of the domestic oil and natural gas in the U.S.  Gale says the agenda for the Midyear Meeting includes oil and gas production in Alaska, the National Energy Policy, petroleum production and environmental issues.  Some guest speakers include Alaska Governor and IOGCC Chairman Tony Knowles, former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, and Alaska Oil & Gas Conservation Commission representatives from Phillips Alaska, OMEGA Oil Company, and BP Amoco.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.

Subject:	Broadcast Message - Trading Floor Stentofons (Reminder with CHANGES!!!)
Importance:	High

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

McNair, who is dealing with a thumb injury, isn't worth starting on your Fantasy team outside of deeper leagues.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Green (abdominal strain) is out for Sunday's game. Reidel Anthony will start in his absence. ! James Stewart , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Stewart (ankle) is out for Sunday's game against Arizona. However, coach Marty Mornhinweg stated that Stewart is making progress, and is getting closer to returning to action.   Marco Battaglia , TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Battaglia (appendectomy) has been placed on injured reserve and is out for the remainder of the 2001 season. The big tight end has no real value as a Fantasy player.   Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Hollowman Updated 11/18/01 Brunell (quadriceps) will start on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He'll be facing a tough Steelers' secondary at less than 100 percent, however, so Fantasy owners may want to consider benching him in Week 10.   Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 Taylor (groin) practiced without incident on Friday, but he still needs medical clearance before he can play in Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. Even is he is able to play, however, he'd only be used on a limited basis. Stacey Mack will get the star! t ! in any event, so playing Taylor on your Fantasy team is not a wise move.   Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Little Bambinos Updated 11/18/01 Pathon (foot) is out for Sunday's game against New Orleans, according to the Indianapolis Star. Reggie Wayne will start in Pathon's place once again.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Jackson (ankle) will likely be a gametime decison on Sunday against Baltimore. If the rookie tailback is unable to play, Jamel White will be Cleveland's featured back with Benjamin Gay getting some looks in the backfield as well.   Correll Buckhalter , RB PHI - Little Bambinos Updated 11/17/01 Buckhalter has been suspended for this weekend's game against Dallas. He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to! p! ublished reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabilitate with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play! . !   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numb! er! s.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerabl! e ! Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Little Bambino! s ! Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac! B! ruce , WR STL - Hollowman Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - AARP Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   More !

"Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition","
After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our ""Ode to Why"" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the ""Leading Company in the World.""

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

"Houston Ballet's Miller Theater Performance of Coppelia","
Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.""
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.""    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

"Dean Strawser requests your input","Let me introduce myself as the new dean of Texas A&M's Lowry Mays
College & Graduate School of Business. As dean of the Mays College
and a member of the class of '83, I am honored to be associated with
our school and look forward to working with you to further its
development.

One of my first and foremost initiatives is engaging our stakeholders
in an intensive branding and imaging campaign to appropriately
communicate what it means to be a graduate of the Mays College and of
Texas A&M University. To do so, I have asked a well-known marketing
and branding consultant and former student, Mr. Brandon Coleman '78,
to assist me in this effort.

Thus far, we have met with current students, faculty, staff,
corporate recruiters, and our college's advisory boards to get their
thoughts. Now, it is time to reach out to you as a graduate of this
college and ask for your valuable opinions.

You have undoubtedly reflected upon your Texas A&M University
experience and have personally seen the value of your business
degree. Please share your reflections with us.
  - What does being a business graduate from Texas A&M mean to you?
  - What should it mean?
  - How are we at the Mays College different?
  - How has your business degree helped you in your life?

While these may seem to be simple questions, your answers will help
us communicate more effectively to others the uniqueness of the
educational experience of the Mays College at Texas A&M.

To respond to these questions, visit
http://maysbusiness.tamu.edu/se/input.htm . Your answers are
anonymous unless you choose to give us your name and contact
information, but doing so isn't required.  You have through December
3 to give us your input  through this Web page.

I thank you in advance for taking the time to give me your feedback,
and ask your understanding of the somewhat impersonal nature of an
e-mail approach.

Please accept my most sincere wishes for every future success. If we
at the Mays College can ever be of assistance to you, do not hesitate
to contact us at maysbusiness@tamu.edu.

Regards, Jerry

Jerry R. Strawser '83, Dean
Mays College & Graduate School of Business
Texas A&M University

College, subscribe to our Web magazine, Mays Business Online at

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Jason,  We're going to make it through the winter - the North American Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment on Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should meet or exceed estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer look at the assessment on Wednesday.   On Wednesday, Interior Secretary Gale Norton talks about the upcoming Lease Area 181 sale.  Secretary Norton believes there's still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on December 5.   The FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday in how it looks at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau on Wednesday from Megawatt Daily Editor Michael Lustig and Electric Power Supply Association President Lynne Church.  Lustig joins us during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast and Church is stopping by at  10:00 a.m. ET.   ENL's Kym McNicholas will also have reaction to Tuesday's FERC ruling.

And during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, Independent Energy Producers Association State Policy Manager Katie Kaplan will join us from the West Coast bureau to give us her take on the FERC's actions.   Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission Regional Manager Leonard Spearman is stopping by the Houston bureau on Wednesday. He'll talk about the TNRCC's role in strengthening homeland security at Texas petrochemical plants and refineries.  Catch the Spearman interview during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow.   The Houston bureau will also bring us a new twist in the search for alternatives to MTBE.  Chris Paschall of Industry Information Resources will talk about the possibility of making ethanol out of wine vines - potential good news for California.  Join us from Houston on Wednesday.

He is one of three Eagles who will be held out of the game. Brian Mitchell will likely serve as Duce Staley's backup.  Jamal Lewis , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/17/01 According to published reports, Lewis has been suspended for four games. Lewis' four-game suspension went into effect on Friday and he will not be allowed to work out or rehabili! ta! te with the team for four weeks, or until Dec. 17. Instead, Lewis will work toward recovering from a torn ACL in Tennessee.   Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Wheatley (knee) is out for Sunday's game with the Chargers. Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy persp! ec! tive.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's pra! ct! ice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson! , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.  Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is wo! rt! h considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper! l! eagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wort! h ! starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had ! on! ly two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, ! bu! t his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates  !

The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary hasn't be! en! playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - Hollowman Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has deve! lo! ped pain in his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season. ! Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - Hollowman Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to ! yo! ur roster as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Consta Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20! /0!  Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Threesome Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Little Bambinos Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fie! ld! er and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"SSSB Utilities Daily","	SCHRODER SALOMON SMITH BARNEY

	British Energy - CEO, Peter Hollins resigned with immediate effect
yesterday. The company has stated that the resignation does not indicate any
deterioration in the outlook for the business performance, but rather
reflects a desire in the Board for a change in leadership. Nevertheless,
once again British Energy has managed to produce a unpleasant surprise for
investors, and there will be doubts over future strategy until such time as
there is clarity over the management succession. Therefore we retain our 4H
Recommendation (Under perform High Risk) and 265p price target (current
price 279p).

	Seven Trent - attached is our note reviewing the preliminary results
of Severn Trent (SVT.L). We retain our 3L (Neutral Low Risk) Recommendation,
with a 730p price target (current price 720p).

	Kelda - attached is our note reviewing the preliminary results of
Kelda (KEL.L). We retain our 3L (Neutral Low Risk) Recommendation, with a
395p price target (current price 384p).

 	 	    Dear Jason,  More cabinet level discussion on President Bush's energy policy recommendations, and ENL is staying on top of the situation.  On Monday afternoon, Washington Correspondent Peter Cook conducted a one-on-one interview with U.S. Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham.  You can view portions of the Abraham interview on Monday's Daily Wrap-Up in ENL's Video Library today.  On Tuesday, we'll bring you other segments from the Abraham interview throughout the day, and log the interview in its entirety in ENL's Video Library.     Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports the bureau is covering the Nuclear Energy Assembly tomorrow.  Vice President Cheney is one of several key energy officials slated to speak at the assembly.  We'll bring you coverage of the event on Tuesday.   Also from Washington, the Senate Energy Committee is scheduled to vote on the potential confirmation of FERC nominees Pat Wood and Nora Brownell on Wednesday.  If the nominees are approved in the meeting, the next step is for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott to take the nominations to the full Senate for a vote.  We'll continue to bring you information on the confirmations as it becomes available.     On Tuesday, the Houston bureau is scheduled to speak with Bill Kimble of KPMG.  ENL's Gale Smith reports Kimble will discuss current convergence in the telecommunications and energy industries, and why more convergence activity is anticipated over the next few years.    Also from ENL's Houston bureau, we're scheduled to bring you a segment on Texas utilities.  An industry group for power grid operators feels Texas is a potential spot for summer electricity problems, but the Electric Reliability Council of Texas disagrees.  And we'll also bring you a follow-up on Duke Energy.  Gale reports Duke will not be able to participate in Florida's wholesale power generation market.  We'll bring you all the details from these and other stories on Tuesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"Rockets Host Kings Tonight","Dear jason,




ROCKETS LOOK TO MOVE BACK OVER .500

The Rockets return to Compaq Center tonight for the first time since dismantling the Dallas Mavericks on Nov. 17 to host hot-shooting Peja Stojakovic and the Sacramento Kings.

Houston will have revenge on its mind against the Kings, who defeated the Rockets 113-77 on Nov. 19. Steve Francis will miss tonight's game to rest a sore foot which caused him to miss Friday's game in Seattle and leave early during Sunday's contest against the Clippers. But Moochie Norris is ready to step in and help the Rockets avenge last week's loss.

Be sure to log on to rockets.com(http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=137036&UID=45454538&MID=190523)later this afternoon to check out our Game Preview section, including video interviews from Rockets players and Head Coach Rudy T. about tonight's game.

TICKETS

You can still pick up your tickets for tonight's game at any Ticketmaster outlet, the Compaq Center box office, or by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX. You can also order tickets quickly and easily online by clicking here (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=137037&UID=45454538&MID=190523).

If you place your order online for tonight's game, be sure to check the will call box for pickup of your tickets.





ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK

After tonight's contest, the Rockets hit the road for a date Friday in Memphis to face the Grizzlies before returning to Compaq Center to host Tim Duncan and the San Antonio Spurs on Saturday.

ESSEX TRADITION CONTINUES WITH LONGWOOD AND CCGROWTH

Boston-based Essex Investment Management, an investment management firm with
a long, rich tradition of managing the fortunes of some of the world's most
powerful leaders, has led to the creation of several equally successful new
ventures. With an investment philosophy built on the foundation that a
company's management team, business model, earnings growth and profitability
will drive its price performance, the firm offers a range of products
including more traditional balanced, growth, and small-, mid-, large-cap
growth as well as its own alternative investment product, a U.S. Hedge
Long/Short fund.

The firm's hedge investment strategy combines bottom-up fundamental research
with secular trend evaluation to invest in companies across all market-caps.
The long investment approach combines both a growth and opportunistic
investment style looking for companies with accelerating fundamentals,
sustainable earnings growth, product or service dominance and consensus
earnings below the firm's projections. The firm's short strategy focuses on
a universe of companies that are in the beginning stages of technical
weakness, downward earnings revisions, peak profit margins and increased
competition.

ROBERT A. DAVIDSON and DON DOUGHERTY, two former Essex portfolio managers
have continued the Essex tradition in managing their own hedge funds,
Longwood Investment Advisors and CCGrowth Management, L.L.C.

LONGWOOD INVESTMENT ADVISORS

Founded in 1994, Boston-based hedge fund Longwood Investment Advisors was
formed by former Essex Investment Management portfolio manager Robert A.
Davidson.  The firm is responsible for Longwood Partners, Longwood Offshore
and Zurich Master Hedge Fund.

Longwood Investment Advisors' long strategy invests in a select number of
attractive, high quality growth-oriented companies.  Longwood looks to
identify companies that are in the early stages of dynamic change, which the
firm believes will translate into accelerating earnings growth.  Emphasis is
placed on purchasing companies where the price of a company's stock is
attractive relative to its intrinsic value.  For Longwood's short
portfolios, the firm looks to short companies with long-term business
valuations that will be negatively affected by poor management, increased
competition or declining industry fundamentals.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $256.5 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 213 companies.  While the firm's
equity assets under management increased slightly from the fourth quarter of
2000 to the first quarter of 2001, the number of companies in the firm's
portfolio increased dramatically.  For the quarter ended December 31, 2001,
the firm reported $172.1 million in equity assets under management invested
in a portfolio of 43 companies.

The most heavily weighted sectors for the quarter included technology
(42.6%), energy (19.8%), financials (10.9%), capital goods (8.9%), and
consumer cyclicals (4.9%).  From the fourth quarter of 2000 through the
first quarter of 2001, the firm greatly increased it holdings in the
technology sector, while decreasing its holdings in the energy, capital
goods, and financial sector.  In the fourth quarter of 2000, the most
heavily weighted sectors included financials (25.6%), energy (21.7%),
capital goods (16.5%), technology (13.5%), and consumer cyclicals (6.6%).

Largest purchases for the quarter included Efunds Corp. [EFDS] with 789,450
valued at $15.2 million; Edwards Lifesciences Corp. [EW] with 462,550 shares
valued at $9.1 million; THQ Inc. [THQI] with 201,950 shares valued at $7.7
million; Informix Corp. [IFMX] with 1,385,000 shares valued at $7.5 million;
and, Celgene Corp. [CELG] with 261,450 shares valued at $6.5 million.

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included Tetra
Technologies Inc. [TTI] with 861,150 shares valued at $17.4 million; Efunds
Corp. [EFDS] with 789,450 shares valued at $15.2 million; Cinar Corp. [CINR]
with 1,300,900 shares valued at $10.1 million; Universal Compression
Holdings [UCO] with 284,250 shares valued at $9.9 million; and, Forest Oil
Corp. [FST] with 320,279 shares valued at $9.6 million.

CCGROWTH MANAGEMENT, L.L.C.

Founded in 1999 by Don Dougherty, a former partner and portfolio manager
with Essex Investment Management, CCGrowth Management, L.L.C. manages the
long/short growth equity Compound Capital Growth Partners, L.P. and Compound
Capital Growth Partners II, L.P. hedge funds.

Using a fundamental, bottom-up approach, combined with technical analysis to
focus primarily on domestic large-cap growth and emerging growth companies,
the firm seeks to invest in companies with a proprietary market position;
improving company or industry outlook; above-average growth; high ROIC;
pricing power; predictable and sustainable earnings; and, low vulnerability
to external events.  On the short side, CCGrowth targets companies with
deteriorating market position; loss of pricing power; new competition; weak
management; vulnerability to external shocks, events or regulatory changes;
weak balance sheet; high valuation; decelerating growth; and, deteriorating
company or industry characteristics.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $192.6 million in
equity assets under management invested in a portfolio of 55 companies.
This was an increase from the fourth quarter of 2000 in which the firm
reported $65.7 million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 50
companies.

Top five holdings, which were all new buys for the first quarter of 2001,
included: Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY] with 500,000
shares valued at $58.3 million; Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with 400,000 shares
valued at $15.7 million; Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. [CHKP] with
290,000 shares valued at $13.8 million; Elan Plc- ADR [ELN] with 256,100
shares valued at $13.4 million; and, Loews Corp. [LTR] with 200,000 shares
valued at $11.9 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

SIRIOS BOOSTS ITS LARGE-CAP HOLDINGS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, hedge fund Sirios Capital
Management, L.P. reported ownership of 98 companies valued at $1.4 billion,
an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 88
companies valued at $1.1 billion.  It was another of the many increases in
equity assets that the firm has reported quarter after quarter.

Former MFS Investment Management members CHRISTIAN FELIPE and JOHN BRENNAN
founded the firm in mid 1999.  The firm has also had some turnover recently,
losing analyst VLADIMIR VELKOV to Tudor Investment Management; the firm has
gained the talents of portfolio manager THOMAS BARRETT, who hails from
Felipe and Brennan's former firm, MFS Investment Management.

In the firm's first filing in December 1999, the firm's large-cap holdings
accounted for approximately 50% of the portfolio.  By June 2000, that figure
had climbed to 65%.  In Sirios Capital's most recent filing, almost 80% of
the Boston-based firm's holdings were in large-caps.

The firm decreased its holdings in the capital goods sector only slightly,
while increasing its ownership in health care, technology, and consumer
cyclicals.  While technology had comprised a large proportion of the firm's
invested assets, in it's most recent filing, technology comprised just 14.0%
of the portfolio.  As recently as September 30, 2000, technology was the top
holding with 29.5% of the portfolio.  The firm's overall assets have
continued to grow, despite a slowing economy and difficult market.  Sirios,
however, is also a nimble player, shifting its investments when necessary;
for the most recent quarter the firm had a portfolio turnover of 195.4%.

Top five holdings for the quarter included: Schering-Plough Corp. [SGP] with
3,710,000 shares (valued at $135.5 million); Voicestream Wireless Corp.
[VSTR] with 1,210,363 shares (valued at $111.8 million); Freddie Mac [FRE]
with 1,416,743 shares (valued at $91.8 million); Tyco International Ltd.
[TYC] with 1,900,000 shares (valued at $82.1 million); and, Bristol Myers
Squibb Co. [BMY] with 755,458 shares (valued at $44.9 million).

Top five new purchases included: JC Penney Co. Inc. [JCP] with 2,100,000
shares (valued at $33.6 million); Gtech Holdings Corp. [GTK] with 786,900
shares (valued at $21.4 million); WellPoint Health Networks Inc. [WLP] with
218,500 shares (valued at $20.8 million); C R Bard Inc. [BCR] with 450,000
shares (valued at $20.4 million); and, Duke Energy Co. [DUK] with 400,000
shares (valued at $17.1 million).

-------------------------------------------------------

INTREPID AND 033 TAKE CONSERVATIVE STANCE

Among the milieu of hedge funds filing for the first quarter, numerous funds
have seen their asset bases drops and have, in many cases, altered their
investments to leave them less vulnerable to technology.  This change in
approach has led them to more moderate investments.  The 13F filings of
Intrepid Capital and 033 Asset Management illustrate a further trend: the
migration of some hedge funds towards more temperate investment instruments.


Intrepid Capital Advisors LLC

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Intrepid Capital Advisors LLC
reported ownership of 52 companies valued at $437.0 million, an increase
from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 65 companies
valued at $263.7 million.

STEVEN SHAPIRO, formerly of Soros Fund Management, and MICHAEL AU, formerly
of Maverick Capital, founded Intrepid Capital in July 1998.  The firm was
originally founded to specialize in the technology sector.  In it's most
recent filing, however, it has seemingly moved away from the sector.
Technology comprised 51.4% of the portfolio, closely followed by financials
with 40.3%.  (However, the firm's financial holdings are not entirely
accurate, since the firm owns ETF's such as the Nasdaq 100 Trust, which are
counted as mutual funds, and thus financials, rather than the underlying
securities they represent.)  By contrast, in the fourth quarter of 2000, the
firm's top sector weightings included technology with 82.5%, financials with
4.4%, and communication services with 3.4%.

Top five holdings included: Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with 2,700,000 shares
(valued at $105.7 million); Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY]
with 600,000 shares (valued at $70.0 million); Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with
550,000 shares (valued at $30.1 million); IBM [IBM] with 309,600 shares
(valued at $29.8 million); and, Qwest Communications International Inc. [Q]
with 600,000 shares (valued at $21.0 million).

Intrepid's new purchases included stakes in Standard Poor's Depository
Receipts, IBM, and Qwest.  Rounding out the top five were new stakes in
Verizon Communications [VZ] with 200,000 shares (valued at $9.9 million),
and Apple Computer Inc. [AAPL] with 300,000 shares (valued at $6.6.
million).

033 Asset Management, L.L.C.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, San Francisco-based hedge fund
033 Asset Management, L.L.C. reported ownership of 18 companies valued at
$73.8 million, a decrease from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 28 companies valued at $126.3 million.  The firm, founded by
former members of the Robertson Stevenson Private Client Group, has managed
to increase its equity assets under management in a market where many other
players have unwittingly watched their assets dwindle.

The founders, including ROBERT TISHMAN, MATTHEW KLEIN, JOHN SCHNUGG, and
MICHAEL VIGO, manage the 033 Growth Partners I, L.P., 033 Growth Partners
II, L.P., Oyster Pond Partners, L.P. and 033 Growth International Fund, Ltd.
Tishman, who serves as the CIO, operates out of the firm's offices in Boston
with analysts DANNY DIAS, and MARIO FIALHO, while the remaining principals
operate out of the firm's San Francisco offices. The firm emphasizes its
focus on technology and is reportedly very active on road shows and in
meeting with company management.

Despite its technology focus, however, the fund seems to have taken less
risky positions in market tracking instruments.  While such baskets of
stocks can be traded and shorted quickly, it may also identify a trend among
some technology funds.  Quickly running out of solid tech-companies to
invest in, many funds are moving to safer positions before returning to the
fray.

For 033 Capital, the large concentration in such instruments is similar to
the previous quarter.  However, the fund did have some turnover, selling out
its holdings in Standard Poor's Depository Receipts Trust [SPY] and Midcap
Spdr Trust Communications Corp. [MDY].  The firm also has an extremely high
turnover; eight of the firm's top ten purchases were new to the firm's
portfolio.  The firm's portfolio turnover rate thus far is 301.7%.

Top ten holdings for the quarter included: iShares Trust (Rusl 2000 Grow)
[IWO] with 563,000 shares (valued at $30.9 million); Sector SPDR Trust (Sbi
Int-Tech) [XLK] with 240,000 shares (valued at $6.0 million); Cendant Corp.
[CD] with 400,000 shares (valued at $5.8 million); Kinder Morgan Inc. [KMI]
with 75,000 shares (valued at $4.0 million); Calpine Corp. with 60,000
shares (valued at $3.3 million); Agile Software Corp. [AGIL] with 275,000
shares (valued at $3.0 million); Entergy Corp. [ETR] with 75,000 shares
(valued at $2.8 million); MCK Communications Inc. [MCKC] with 1,238,000
shares (valued at $2.7 million); Dynegy Inc. New [DYN] with 50,000 shares
(valued at $2.6 million); and, Fibernet Telecom Group Inc. [FTGX] with
923,260 shares (valued at $2.5 million).

SECTOR COVERAGE: STATE STREET RESEARCH & MANAGEMENT

Boston-based State Street Research & Management, with $18.5 billion in
equity assets as of March 31, 2001, recently lost one its top portfolio
managers to the world of hedge funds.  RUDOLPH KLUIBER, formerly a portfolio
manager specializing in small-cap value stocks with State Street Research &
Management Co., left the firm to launch a hedge fund with GREGORY FRASER and
TIMOTHY KROCHUK, who recently left Fidelity. At State Street, Kluiber
managed the State Street Research Aurora Fund (with $989.4 million in equity
assets as of September 30, 2000) and Advantus Venture Fund.  Except for the
loss of Kluiber, State Street's investment team has remained relatively
intact since the end of last year.  STEPHEN C. ORR, who previously covered
computer services, electronic equipment, electronics- semiconductors,

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Jason,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Giggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post solid Fantasy numb! er! s.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Update! d ! 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   ! Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   ! Bubba Franks  , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

ENL's Washington bureau is scheduled to bring us updates on developments from the trip.       On Tuesday we'll have details from Peter's trip to Maryland.

If you missed it the first time around, be sure to catch details from Yannello's report in our Video Library.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  See you at 9:00 a.m. ET Tuesday!

"Compaq Question of the Game","Dear jason,


Throughout the course of the 2000-2001 Rockets season, viewers of Rockets telecasts on UPN 20 were asked to log on to rockets.com and submit a question to broadcasters Bill Worrell and Calvin Murphy.

Worrell and Murphy chose one question each game to answer live on-air, with all participants who submitted a question being entered into a drawing for the chance to win a Compaq computer and an autographed Rockets item.

Congratulations to Kris Martinak of Houston! Kris was selected from 2,754 participants as the winner of a Compaq Presario 7000 personal computer and a Rockets 2000-2001 Team Autographed Basketball.

Look for the Compaq Question of the Game contest again next Rockets season. In the meantime, be sure to visit rockets.com often this offseason to keep abreast of the latest Rockets developments.

"OH JOY! I FINALLY SEE MY WAISTLINE!!!!..... 1653808","I sincerely apologize if you are receiving this e-mail in error.
I have been taking an herbal formula for 10 months and it has saved my family and my life. Because of this I have made a commitment to get the word out on this life-changing product, so that it will be available to everyone. 
My name is 0Iivia Havlin. I'm a married 37-year-old mother of 4 who was a happy size 7 before my first child and who grew 4 dress sizes larger by my fourth pregnancy. 
It's amazing how long you can avoid dealing with a problem that you simply don't want to face up to.
I didn't like the way I looked and I didn't like the way I felt. I was at the point where I just didn't want to live and have to face another day.
I WAS SICK OF BEING FAT!
I FELT THAT I OWED IT TO MY HUSBAND, MY FOUR CHILDREN, AND MYSELF TO MAKE ONE MORE ATTEMPT AT WEIGHT LOSS.
I have researched and tried many weight loss programs during my ""yo-yo dieting"" years. I did Slim Fast, Cybervision, Atkins, soup diets, starvation, ""exercise and eat no fat,"" chromium picolinate, metabolic enhancers, and more. You name it, I tried it!
I lost some pounds with every diet, but eventually gained them back, usually with a few extra pounds. On every one of those diets, I lost energy, and eventually had to eat a lot to feel better. I was grouchy with a short fuse. This even happened during the diet where I exercised and ate less with only low-fat foods, the better-known ""right way"" to lose weight. I'm sure losing weight that way works OK for many people, but it just didn't work very well for me. 
It seemed my metabolism froze, and I was going to stay at that weight forever, but I wanted to look better and be healthy. I was very depressed and disappointed. I dieted on and off, but got nowhere. The weight kept returning. 
I suddenly realized just how difficult this weight problem had really become. Now I understood why so many people have the same problem.
I almost gave up. Then, I remembered something I heard from old my friend Janie. She told me about a company who makes a nutritionally-engineered weight loss product, which ACCELERATES WEIGHT LOSS. It was developed by European Scientists and had been kept a secret for years, UNTIL NOW. Scientists from an American Nutriceutical company met up with their top scientist and brought the secret here. It is a unique product, called BerryTrim Plus, and 
NO OTHER PRODUCT HAS THESE INGREDIENTS.
It sounded too good to be true. I didn't want to get all hyped up about some new program, and I didn't want to add one more diet to my failure list. 
What really made me decide to try it were all the testimonials I read on their web site, written by so many Doctors, Celebrities, and people like you and me.
I called for my 30-day supply and was so amazed when only after the first 3 days, I began to experience a sense of ""well being"" - something I hadn't felt for months, maybe years. I felt ENERGIZED, not to mention my sugar/chocolate cravings were absolutely gone!
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE I FELT!
I began to hope again - maybe I could lose this old weight. I gave this pursuit up months before and had boxed up my smallest clothes to give away! After 5 weeks of BerryTrim Plus I had already lost 10 inches off my hips and thighs and, 
OH JOY! I FINALLY SEE MY WAISTLINE!
Not to mention, 
THE SCALE WAS ACTUALLY SPINNING BACKWARDS AND SHOWING A TREMENDOUS WEIGHT LOSS!
THE BEST PART IS, I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY I ATE, WHAT I ATE, OR ADD AN EXERCISE ROUTINE TO MY DAILY REGIMEN. ALL I DID WAS USE THE PRODUCT, AND THE WEIGHT SIMPLY CAME OFF_
EASILY AND SAFELY! THAT'S IT.
Well, now today I'm 4 dress sizes & 7 jean sizes smaller + 26?FFFFBD inches are gone!
I FEEL ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!
I really wish I could show you how I looked 10 months ago compared to how I look now. The differences are unbelievable. I recently traveled and when I had to show a picture I.D. at the airport for security reasons, the airline agent asked for ""another"" form of picture I.D. because my driver's license picture doesn't look like me anymore! 
It's kind of embarrassing receiving all of the compliments about how ""great I look"" now. It's even more embarrassing to mention it. But they keep coming. The greatest compliment I got was from my husband, Recently, he told me, ""Olivia, you really look great, you look like the young girl I kissed at our wedding."" I said, ""WHAT?"" He told me that I ""looked younger"". He said my face looked especially younger, ""you look like the real you!"" 
It was true, just like everything I had read about the product. It all came true! 
That was a first for any weight loss program I had ever tried.
The changes that took place were both subtle and obvious. Here are some of them: 
MY ATTITUDE IMPROVED
I HAVE LESS TENSION AND ANXIETY
RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY FAMILY IMPROVED
QUALITY OF MY SLEEP IMPROVED
I NOW SLEEP THROUGH THE ENTIRE NIGHT
I HAVE GREATER ENERGY
COMPULSIVE EATING DECREASED
CRAVINGS FOR SWEETS DECREASED
I HAVE LESS FREQUENT HOT FLASHES
NO LONGER DRINK CAFFEINE THROUGHOUT THE DAY
NO LONGER SLEEP FOR HOURS IN THE AFTERNOONS
NO LONGER EXPERIENCE DISCOMFORT WITH MOVEMENT.
I feel better now than I've felt in years. Thanks to BerryTrim Plus and Janie, who introduced me to it. 
I invite you to try it for 30-days. I promise you'll be calling for more soon after!""
Look, if you want to try out this product, it can change your life. If you don't want to, that's OK too. At least find some way to lose weight that works for you. Your life will change after you lose the weight. Many people won't try it because they won't believe it. Unfortunately, with all the marketing and scams out there, we all have to be skeptical. If I tried to hand out fifty dollar bills on a city sidewalk, most people would not take it because they would think it was some kind of trick. This is not a trick. It worked for me. 
Whether you need to take off five pounds or five hundred, this will help you do it in a healthy way. The company has a 60-day money-back guarantee, and I called to check on that. They get practically no returns and 92% re-orders. That says it all if you ask me. You order directly from the company and use a credit card. Their link is at the end of this story. , Click through this website thoroughly and marvel over what this amazing product has done for so many people like you and me! 
I can assure you that I would not publicly put my credibility on the line unless everything I have told you here was 100% true. So, do take a look at the many success stories from others who have gained better health, improved their relationships, and of course, lost weight and are keeping it off for good. The testimonials speak for themselves. And if you decide this is something you are willing to try - GO FOR IT!!!!! You won't be sorry. Do take the time to read them. Many are more AMAZING than my own!
Click here to read many of the success stories.CLICK HERE 
Thank you for your patience and interest. 
God Bless, 
Olivia Havlin

"Be a Super Sleuth","  Imagine how wonderful it would feel to help a large number of children in your area and 
making $4,000 to $12,000 per month doing it?                                                                      
Helping needy children and parents AND at the same time supporting your own family very well financially.
Every day in your community there are single parents struggling to make ends meet and wondering where the money will come from to cover their children's basic expenses. 
Most of these parents are hard working people who just need help from the person who has a legal responsibility to give it to them. 
 Every day a large number of parents call us for help in collecting their child support.    Many more than we can possibly handle.  We need the help of caring and dedicated people who would like to enter a new high paying prestigious profession. 
The court has decided how much these parents are to receive but the caseloads are so large that the results are that there is over  $32 Billion dollars worth of uncollected Child Support in the US today   and this amount grows by millions every week.  
If you would be interested in helping us, then  we have all of the training that you will need to start a new business in this high growth profession of ""Child Support Processing!""   
We have the resources available to you to help you track down deadbeat parents and force them to pay what they legally owe, without ever having to come into contact with them! 
 We have the most extensive Computer Data Bases in the world for the processing of Child Support.   Our databases allow you to track down dead beats, find their assets and then collect the child support, which is due.  These powerful databases will be available to you if you choose to join us.
  You can do what private investigators do, legally, and for a fraction of what it would normally cost! And you can do it from the comfort of your own home office!  
More details about our Child Support Collection Course:
  Child Support Collection has reached epidemic proportions, $32 billion nationally  ; state agencies are simply too understaffed!  State agencies are typically very happy when we assist a parent.  We find the dead beat and their assets and the state agencies are pleased to use their government powers, working with us, to collect the back child support. 
 Our Child Support Collection course teaches you to how locate the DEAD-BEAT parent, their assets, employment, bank accounts and how to collect on those assets.  
The manual supplies the forms, brochures, and child support business methodology. 
We also have the most powerful reporting capabilities at your disposal to help you track down dead-beat parents. 
 Unpaid child support is an epidemic . . . and you can be the cure!  
As our national and local media remind us every day, millions of custodial parents are struggling to raise their families without the child support to which they are entitled. In fact, you or someone you know is probably tackling this problem right now. 
 This Child Support Collection Course teaches you to recover your own child support payments. Or you can learn to help others in need, earning about 25% to 30% of what is collected.  That translates to $4,000 . . . $8,000 . . .even $12,000 earned each month collecting for others! You'd be hard-pressed to come up with any other legal business opportunity that allows you to earn such a significant income while performing such a valuable community service.  
Not only do you have the potential to make thousands of dollars a month recovering delinquent child support payments, you'll also ""earn"" the gratitude of custodial parents and their children who are finally receiving the money they're due! 
You might be thinking a successful child support recovery business would require a difficult time commitment or a lot of expensive equipment. Not at all! You can make thousands of dollars each month, part-time or full-time, working from your home, with only a telephone and a home computer! 
This course places you at the leading edge of a major national trend, namely, privatizing the recovery of delinquent child support payments. Whereas the government succeeds only one fifth of the time in this area, well-trained private parties are doing four times better! 
And remember every time you recover a payment, you can earn 25% to 30% of what you find! 
 We provide step by step instructions for you to follow, enabling you to collect all back-owed child support for yourself or anyone else you choose. It is not necessary to have in-depth legal knowledge or even a college education.  
According to the Department of Health and Human Services, absent parents in the United States have a big bill to pay: $32 billion in delinquent child support payments. That is over 15 million cases, with 1.5 million new cases added every year. More than half of court-ordered child support cases become delinquent at some time, and in more than one fourth of cases, no payments are ever made. 
Children deserve and need the support they have been awarded, but government agencies aren't offering any real help because they are totally over whelmed. In fact, the agencies are so flooded with requests that they only collect about 18% of the child support money they go after. In other words, the government typically has an 82% failure rate! No private business could survive with that kind of record, and the impact on children can be devastating. 
Statistics show that after a divorce, an absent parent's available income goes up 43%, while the custodial parent's spending money goes down 20%. 
 With your help, children in need have a four-times-greater chance of receiving the money they are due than if they relied on the government for recovery.  
One mother has told us that working with the government to find an absent parent ""is like beating your head against a brick wall. The frustration and futility you feel are enormous. Agencies crawl at a snails pace, and authorities often lose files or seem to make no progress with a case."" But this same mother's outlook changed  after reviewing our course: ""I would have given anything to have this knowledge years ago. This is the best $249.00 I have ever spent.""

TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT YOUR LIFE.....
Do you think you are paid what you are worth? 
Will you be set to retire in the next few years? 
Do you control the course of your day, or does someone watch over you?
The fact is we have many people in our enterprise that earn over 50k per

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  ENL's Washington Correspondent Peter Cook and I had the chance to speak with newly-confirmed FERC Commissioner Pat Wood on Thursday.  Commissioner Wood discussed what role he would play within the FERC, the issue of price caps in California and the threat by Governor Gray Davis to sue the FERC.       Immediately following the Wood interview, I spoke with former FERC Commissioner Don Santa to get his reaction to the Gov. Davis lawsuit.  If you missed the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast, catch both the Wood and Santa interviews in ENL's Video Library.    The House and Senate are still on recess, but our Washington bureau has much to cover on Friday.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports, with the House and Senate coming back to Capitol Hill on Tuesday, the change of power in the Senate could be decided sometime next week.  Jay says the bureau is scheduled to take a look at some of the comments and reactions from around Washington, and discuss what effect the power shift could have on President Bush's energy plan and the energy debate.  We'll have insight and discussion from our Washington bureau on Friday.     We're also scheduled to bring you segments from Correspondent Stephanie Stanton's trip to Florida.  She attended the groundbreaking ceremony for the Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline, which is a joint venture between Duke Energy and Williams Energy, parent company of ENL.  Catch coverage of Stephanie Stanton's trip on Friday.   Houston bureau Correspondent Kim Benestante reports she's scheduled to bring us details from a settlement reached between the Texas environmental agency TNRCC, and a group of refiners/utilities over reducing air emission in Texas.  Kim also says the bureau is scheduled to discuss the Texas Fresh Air Project.

"Fw: Dear Friend & Future Millionaire:","Dear Future Millionaire:

I'll make you a promise. READ THIS PAGE TO THE END! - follow what it says
to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not,
who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know
what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One
day though, something just said ""you throw away $25.00 going to a movie for
2 hours with your wife"". ""What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you
believe ""those feelings"" come from, I thank goodness every day that I had
that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had
I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply
because you are buying and selling something of value.


AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:
Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this
letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an
entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if
it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not
the program was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are
''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if
people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound to make some mega
bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''.
DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS
ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: '' Thanks to this profitable opportunity"". I
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad
I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $
610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in''.
Pam Hedland
Fort Lee, New Jersey.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another said: ""this program has been around for a long time but I never
believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided
to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3
weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00
but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in
the past 8 months by reentering the program, I have made over $710,000.00
and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow
the simple steps and NOT change anything.''


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
More testimonials later but first,

PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and
comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN !!!

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE, GUARANTEED!

INSTRUCTIONS:
Order all 5 reports shown on the list below
For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.
WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS!
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and
resell them. OUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Within a few days you will
receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different
individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you
to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a
floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens
to your computer. IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are
listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other
than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose
out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works,
you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this
method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work !!! People
have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they
could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe
 s, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try
to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will
not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate
BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat
it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.
 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made
it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.
 2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.

PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is
critical to YOUR success.

**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a disk as well
just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your
business on the Internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with
invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mail's
legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There
are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:

METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mail's each Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the
response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many
people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mail's instead of only 5,000
each). Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mail's With a
0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people
responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of
those 50,000 e-mail's only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people
responded and ordered Report # 2. Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mail's
each for a total of 500,000 e-mail's The 0.2% response to that is 1000
orders for Report # 3. Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total
of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report
# 4. Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mail's each fo
a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mail's The 0.2% response to that is
100,000 orders for Report # 5.
THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million
dollars).
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....
$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00
NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE
WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL
STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF
5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if
everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mail's
each or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide
and counting, with thousands
more coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that,
and more!


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET

Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of
FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will
easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1
and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do
is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day
service on all orders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,
with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not
advertise until they receive the report.

""Parents of 15-year old find $71,000 cash hidden in his closet.""

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Does this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have
seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).
This 15 year olds mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came
across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some
clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son's closet.
Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the
bag and found it was full of cash. Five dollar bills, twenties, fifties and
hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. ""My first thought was
that he had robbed a bank"", says the 41-year-old woman, ""There was over
$71,000 dollars in that bag- that's more than my husband earns in a year"".
The woman immediately called her husband at the car dealership where he
worked to tell him what she'd discovered. He came home right away and they
drove together to the boy's school and picked him up. Little did they
suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually
finding it in the closet.
As it turns out, the boy had been sending out via E-mail on the Internet a
type of 'chain-letter' to E-mail addresses that he got off of the Internet.
Everyday after school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on
his computer in his bedroom. ""I just got the E-mail one day and I figured
what the heck, I Sent five dollars to five people for the Reports, put my
name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out"", says
the clever 15-year-old. The Reports I received for my 25 dollars were
fantastic. The E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions
to send one $5 dollar bill to each of the 5 individuals. These individuals
would in turn e-mail me the 5 Reports. ""I get junk E-mail all the time, and
I really didn't think it was gonna work"", the boy continues. Within the
first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box that his
parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to
fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 dollar bills. ""About
a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and
my box had 1 magazine and about 300 envelopes stuffed in it. There was also
a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter- I
thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)"". He goes on, ""I went up to
the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. Over the next few
weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail. ""The money just kept coming
in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, I barely had
time for my homework"". He had also been riding his bike to several of the
area's banks and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties and hundreds.
""I didn't want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different
banks with like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell
the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in [to exchange the
money] and he was outside waiting for me. Surprisingly, the boy didn't have
any reason to be afraid. The reporting news team
  'chain-letter' the boy was sending out and found that it wasn't a
chain-letter at all. In fact, it was completely legal according to US Postal
and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005
in the US code, also in the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections
255 and 436, which state a product or service must be exchanged for money
received. Every five dollar bill that he received, he immediately sent out
the report requested. This Report made the letter legal because he was
exchanging a service (Sending a Report requested) for a five dollar fee. The
Reports that you will receive and eventually send out, are the power behind
the program. They include insider tips and techniques for cost effective
promotion. These Reports are very comprehensive and will allow you to build
and promote any business product or service on the Internet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You have just read the letter that the 15-year-old was sending out by
E-mail, you can do the exact same thing he was doing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
AVAILABLE REPORTS:
The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow
""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be
cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is
money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash
(US CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is
concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those
sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering,
YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.

My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody, and I live in Chicago, IL. I am a cost
accountant with a major US Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I
received the program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ""junk mail."" I made
fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and
percentages involved. I ""knew"" it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my
supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of
her, and was ready to lay the old ""I told you so"" on her when the thing
didn't work... well, the laugh was on me! Within two weeks she had received
over 50 responses. Within 45 days she had received over $147,200 in $5
bills! I was shocked! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it
wouldn't work. I AM a believer now. I have joined Jody in her ""hobby."" I did
have seven more years until retirement, but I think of the ""rat race"" and
it's not for me. We owe it all to MLM.
 Mitchell Wolf MD., Chicago, IL

The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is
honest, lawful, extremely profitable, and is a way to get a large amount of
money in a short time. I was approached several times before I checked this
out. I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal
effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received $36,470.00 in the
first 14 weeks, with money still coming in.
Charles Morris, Esq.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind
to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that the
initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't
get enough orders to at least get my money back. Boy, was I surprised when I
found my medium- size post office box crammed with orders! For awhile, it
got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window. I'll
make more money this year than any 10 years of my life before. The nice
thing about this deal is that it doesn't matter where people live. There
simply isn't a better investment with a faster return.
 Paige Willis, Des Moines, IA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if
I shouldn't have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to
get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program,
...11 months passed then it came...I didn't delete this one!...I made more
than $41,000 on the first try!!
Violet Wilson, Johnstown, PA

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is my third time to participate in this plan. We have quit our jobs,
and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our
money. The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do
it. For your sake, and for your family's sake don't pass up this golden
opportunity. Good luck and happy spending!

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  There's a probability of a shift in power in Washington as rumors surround Senator Jim Jeffords (R-VT).  Washington officials are saying Sen. Jeffords is planning to abandon the Republican Party, although no one is certain whether he'll become a Democrat or an Independent.  Either way, the move would give Democrats the Senate majority, which could have a major impact on the Bush administration's ability to implement its national energy policy.  Sen. Jeffords has scheduled a press conference from Vermont on Thursday morning, and ENL's Washington bureau will bring you details on his announcement.   Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports the House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to mark up the Electricity Emergency Relief Act on Thursday.  Jay expects Democrats to once again attempt to include price caps on wholesale power in the markup.       Jay also reports, next week President Bush is scheduled to travel to California to assess the energy situation.  While there, Bush is expected to meet with Governor Gray Davis to discuss energy policy.  ENL's Washington bureau will be following developments surrounding the President's trip next week.   Also from our DC bureau, I'm scheduled to speak with former Chairman of the Senate Energy and Environmental Resources Committee Bennett Johnston.  He's scheduled to join us in the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast.   On tap from the Houston bureau on Thursday:  Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the Texas House of Representatives has approved subsidies toward a bill that would drastically cut diesel emissions in the state.  The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on an upcoming meeting between Enron and India officials about payment for power.  We'll have all the details from these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Thursday.       Also from the Houston bureau, Bureau Chief of the Energy Intelligence Group Barbara Shook is scheduled to join us on Thursday.  She'll discuss a state-of-the-art Shell Gas to Liquids terminal in Malaysia that turns gas into emissions-free diesel fuel.  Catch these and other stories from Houston on Thursday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

DIFFERENT STYLES, BILLION-DOLLAR HEDGE FUNDS: TUDOR AND DUQUESNE REPORT

For the third quarter ended September 30, 2001, Boston-based hedge fund
Tudor Investment Corporation reported ownership of 223 companies, valued at
$2.78 billion, a slight decrease from the previous quarter when the firm
reported $2.82 billion in equity assets under management invested in a
portfolio of 196 companies.  The firm has managed to keep a large asset base
over the years despite market fluctuations and its aggressive growth style.


Duquesne Capital Management, the firm started by George Soros lieutenant
STANEY DRUCKENMILLER, has also weathered numerous difficult markets but
using a GARP oriented style that often reflected that of Soros. For the
third quarter ended September 30, 2001, Pittsburgh, PA-based hedge fund
Duquesne Capital Management reported ownership of 120 companies, valued at
$1.10 billion, a decrease from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 114 companies, valued at $1.26 billion.

Despite the tumultuous market, both funds have managed to keep their equity
assets under management within relatively narrow margins, but nearly always
in the billions.  Despite different styles, both firms seemed to increase
their bullishness on technology.

TUDOR INVESTMENT CORPORATION

Tudor Investment Corporation increased its holdings in sectors like consumer
cyclicals, health care, and technology while moving away from financials,
diversified, and communication services.

Top five holdings for the firm included: H&R Block Inc. [HRB] with 3,113,000

fund 033 Asset Management, L.L.C. reported ownership of 24 companies valued
at $30.6 million, a decrease from the previous quarter when the firm
reported ownership of 26 companies valued at $101.2 million.

professionals.  The firm manages technology-oriented hedge funds including
the 033 Growth Partners I, L.P., 033 Growth Partners II, L.P., Oyster Pond
Partners, L.P. and 033 Growth Intl. Fund, Ltd.

Since its previous filing, the firm moved more into sectors like technology,

CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN HEDGE FUND

When JULIAN H. ROBERTSON, JR. decided to wind-down his legendary Tiger
Management, L.L.C., he became a fixture on television, explaining that the
economy had changed too greatly for his style of investment and that he was
not prepared to change the funds' investment styles to adapt to momentum
technology investing. Yet now it appears that Robertson, through an old
acquaintance, has moved into technology investments, just when technology
and the ""New Economy"" appear to be in their darkest hour.   Indeed, it seems
ironic even that Robertson, a name synonymous with value oriented investment
would be involved in something resembling the ""New Economy,"" a concept he
often derided as a Ponzi scheme.

Tiger Technology, L.P. began operations on March 1, 2001.  The fund's
general partner is CHARLES P. COLEMAN III, who is joined by a three-member
investment team that is responsible for the coverage of various technology
related industries.  The team includes Coleman, the former partner and
assistant portfolio manager with Tiger Management LLC.   His primary
coverage is in the software and Internet sectors, an area he covered while
at Banc of America Securities (then Montgomery Securities).  JONATHAN
LOCKER, a research analyst, joined the firm after serving as a financial
analyst in the Technology Mergers and Acquisitions Group at Morgan Stanley &
Co.  He primarily covers the communications sector.  KARTHIK SARMA, a
research analyst, is the third member of the investment team.  Sarma's
primary coverage includes the software and service sector, fields he worked
with while a junior engagement manager at McKinsey & Company.

The team members meet regularly with company management and monitor sales
activity in different technology end-markets and spends significant time
modeling and performing valuation analysis on portfolio investments.  The
fund screens for companies with sound business models in attractive markets,
forward-looking management teams with superior operational skills, strong
cash flows contributing to solid balance sheets, reasonable Wall Street
earnings expectations and attractive valuations.  The firm's investment team
also seeks to exploit its contacts in the technology field to gain greater
insights on technology related industries.

When looking for short opportunities, the firm looks for companies with poor
management teams, under-performing products, deteriorating financial
performance, and unrealistic earning expectations.  The fund also attempts
to maintain between 5% and 50% of its exposure in international equities.

Tiger is also heavily marketing two other long/short funds, Tiger Sharks
Partners LP and the Tiger Asia Fund LP.  THOMAS FACCIOLA and MICHAEL SEARS
are reportedly managing the Tiger Sharks fund while BILL HWANG is currently
responsible for the Tiger Asia fund.  At present, Tiger Management provides
administrative services including accounting, settlement, and trading for
the funds.

consumer staples sector also decreased. At the end of the third quarter,
this sector represented only 5.2%, the quarter before 8.3% of the portfolio
was invested in consumer staples.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  On Tuesday we brought you a segment from Washington Correspondent Peter Cook's visit to Maryland.  Peter was invited to travel with Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham while the Secretary toured the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant.  If you missed Peter's report on Sec. Abraham and the Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Plant, log on to ENL's Video Library to view the segment in its entirety.       The House and Senate are on Memorial Day recess for the rest of the week, and they're scheduled to reconvene on June 5.  While it's relatively quiet in Washington, ENL's Washington bureau is keeping an eye on President Bush's trip to California.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says tomorrow they'll have updates from the meeting between the President and Governor Gray Davis.  They'll also continue to follow the President in California as he travels to Fresno and Sequoia National Park on Wednesday.   Also on Wednesday, the FERC is scheduled to conduct a regular meeting.  It is unclear whether newly confirmed FERC Commissioners Nora Brownell and Pat Wood will take part in the meeting.   Finally, from our D.C. bureau on Wednesday, Competitive Enterprise Institute's Christopher Horner is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss the defection of Sen. James Jeffords from the Republican Party and the effect this move may have on the national energy policy.  Log on to see the Horner interview in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast.     The Houston Bureau is going to shed some light on job availability within the energy industry.  Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the bureau is scheduled to bring us details on the difficulties some companies are having recruiting employees during boom periods.  Kim also reports the bureau is scheduled to bring us a story on an international energy jobs recruiter.  We'll find out what areas of the industry are growing, and where employees are being hired.  The Houston bureau will bring us these and other stories on Wednesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

I want to hear that you are coaching, or maybe that you aren't coaching but
you are going to start working hard on becoming a better ball player.  What
we need is a good team mom.  Do you think you could stop off before each
game and pick up some snickers and sodies.  Each player gets to pick the
drink and candy each week and then you go get the stuff.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Jason,  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford is back in Washington, D.C. today.  He says next week will be a whirlwind with the unveiling of the White House Energy Task Force's National Energy Policy recommendations. President Bush will be in St. Paul, Minnesota on Thursday announcing the recommendations, and D.C. bureau's Peter Cook is getting ready to cover the event.  Peter will bring us reports next week.   Also from Washington, D.C. next week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is holding a much-anticipated confirmation hearing for the two newest FERC nominees.  If the committee clears Pat Wood and Nora Mead Brownell, the full Senate could consider the nominations soon after.  We'll have more information on the hearing next week.     Houston bureau's Kim Benestante tells us the Panda Corporation is bringing a  1,000-megawatt power plant online in June in Odessa, TX.  The new plant will accompany their Guadalupe County plant near San Antonio that's already online.  Kim says she'll also bring us details on a Los Angeles investor that is buying majority interest in Plains Pipeline.  Log on all next week for stories from ENL's Houston bureau.      Also next week, Houston bureau's Gale Smith is in Anchorage, Alaska covering the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  We'll bring you reports from Gale in Alaska next week.   We have plenty more energy news coming up on ENL.  On Monday from our D.C. bureau, Editor of Downstream Energy Group Carol Cole is scheduled to join us.  She'll be live in D.C. to discuss the fallout from the Valero-Ultramar Diamond Shamrock merger.  You can catch Cole's comments in the 4:00 p.m. ET broadcast.    In the 9:00 a.m. ET broadcast on Wednesday, President and COO of Unit Corporation John Nikkel is scheduled to be in studio to discuss drilling.  Log on all week to catch these and other interviews.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com for all your energy news.  Have a great weekend!

"Re: your domain name","We were referred to you by a friend and understand that you may be interested in securing your very own domain name. Did you know that domain names are being registered at the rate of more than 30,000 per day? You should reserve your name domain now before someone else registers it. Do you want an email address that will suit your name, business or personal interest? If so, you need to secure your domain NOW at: http://www.WorldWideRegistry.net
FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY . . .
We invite you to take advantage of our special CHARTER RATE on dot com registrations. Register your dot com name now and save almost 50% off the regular rate of US$35.  For a  limited time only, secure your dot com name for just US$17.95 per year and you can keep it for life!  To register your domain name or just check if your dot com name is still available, go to http://www.WorldWideRegistry.net

IMPORTANT:
More than 28 million dot com names have been registered already and good names are going fast. According to International Data Corporation, more than 800 mllion Internet users will have their own dot com name by 2003.  Get your's before it's too late!   To register your domain name or just check if your dot com name is still available, go to http://www.WorldWideRegistry.net



===================================
WHY YOU NEED A DOT COM

1. Get a Better Name For Yourself
Whether you are a professional, a business or just someone who uses e-mail a lot, you may find that your current e-mail address is too complicated or simply too boring to remember. Recently, dot com registrars have allowed ANYONE (businesses and consumers) to register dot com names up to 67 characters long. Because there can only be ONE unique dot com name in the world, many people are rushing to reserve their names before its taken by someone else. Some examples are:

- msmith@westcoastconsulting,com
- jenny@chan,com
- johnbrown@bestwestdesigns,com
- david@harpinder,com



2. Never Change Your E-Mail Address Again*
Having your own dot com name allows you to KEEP your identity on the Internet. You will never have to change your e-mail address again once you have your own dot com name. Your will be able to move your e-mail address from one Internet provider to another because YOU OWN IT! Imagine the headaches and friends you will save by not having to inform everyone eachtime you change your e-mail address.


3. Thinking of a Web Site Later? Think Dot Com First!*
If you have considered building a web site sometime in the future, you should reserve your dot com name today. Once you have your own dot com name, you will be able to use it for a matching web site address (www,YourName,com) later on.

*Note:  You will still require your ISP to host your email box.  A dot com name ensures that you keep your email and web address no matter which ISP you are with.

The Panthers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in deeper Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary has! n'! t been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy Football. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.!  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's game against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain i! n ! his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexander will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during their charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ro! st! er as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadriceps) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  Ricky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has not sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times . He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01  Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``Th! at! 's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him out and put somebody else in.""   ! Be! njamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01! Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.

Charlie Garner will once again be Oakland's feature back. Zack Crockett may be used in goal-line situations.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Wycheck is expected to play half of Sunday's game against Cincinnati. That makes him a risky start from a Fantasy perspective.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 McNair's status is still in question for Sunday's game against Cincinnati due to an injured right thumb. He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterback for Sunday's game against San Francisco. However, he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this season, but it's almost impossible to bench him based on his potential to post sol! id! Fantasy numbers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Williams is one of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use on a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underachieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie Jackson , WR NO - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped up his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is right. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid using him outside of deeper leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Road Rage Updated 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Hollowman Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - AARP Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwell is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threesome Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers, but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfield this weekend in James Stewart's absence. Neither back has much Fantasy value outside of deeper leagues, and starting them is a huge gamble.   Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/16/01 Warren will likely start in place of the injured James Stewart on Sunday against Arizona. He's split carries with Reuben Droughns, and is only worth starting as a last resort in larger Fantasy leagues.

TERMINATE CREDIT CARD DEBT

? NO
Bankruptcy
? NO Debt Consolidation
? NO Do-it-yourself program

Legal ? Private ? Painless ? Inexpensive
GUARANTEED
RESULTS!

Dear Friend,
Let me get right to the point!

We have a simple solution that offers you immediate relief. It is NOT bankruptcy.
It is NOT debt consolidation. It is NOT a do-it-yourself program.
Are you using credit card &#147;C&#148; to pay off
cards
&#147;A&#148; &amp; &#147;B&#148;?

Are you making only minimum payments on your
credit cards&#133; never really reducing the principal?

Are you tired of answering the phone to creditors
wrecking your piece of mind?

Are you buried in credit card debt, or unpaid
medical bills?

If you answered YES to ANY of these questions, we can
help!!

You'll take comfort in knowing, this is 100% private, LEGAL, ethical, moral, inexpensive,
effective, and will relieve you of the burden QUICKLY and PAINLESSLY.

How's this for a guarantee?

IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT GET RID OF YOUR CREDIT CARD DEBT &#150; THE DEBT WILL BE PAID OFF
FOR YOU!

What do you have to do?

Call now toll-free 1-888-726-9210 and listen to a brief yet exciting
recorded message. Be sure to request our free report &quot;What
You MUST Know to Legally Terminate Unsecured Debt.&quot;

You could IMMEDIATELY LIGHTEN YOUR DEBT, YOUR MOOD, AND THE BURDEN YOU ARE CARRYING ON
YOUR SHOULDERS.

There is ABSOLUTELY NO OBLIGATION.

Believe me, if you are sleepless over creditors harassing you, YOU WILL THANK ME for this!

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Happy Holidays,

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk becaus! e ! of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a go! od! outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/25/01Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 ! Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inco! ns! istent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed Sun! da! y's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

KINGDON DECREASES EXPOSURE TO THE ENERGY SECTOR

According to its 13F for the first quarter of 2001, Kingdon Capital
Management reported approximately $1.6 billion in equity assets invested in
a portfolio of 144 companies.  This is a slight decrease from the previous
quarter, in which the firm reported $1.9 billion in equity assets invested
in a portfolio of 167 companies.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included:  Arbitron
Inc. [ARB] with 1,090,000 shares valued at $100.8 million; Philip Morris
Cos. Inc. [MO] with 1,250,000 shares valued at $59.3 million; Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. [GS] with 500,000 shares valued at $42.5 million; Waste
Management Inc. [WMI] with 1,700,000 shares valued at $42.0 million; and,
Orion Power Holdings Inc. [ORN] with 1,150,000 shares valued at $35.3
million.

The firm's holding in Arbitron represents the largest new position this
quarter.  Other new positions for the firm include: Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. [LEH] with 450,000 shares valued at $28.2 million; Tosco Corp. [TOS]
with 600,000 shares valued at $25.7 million; Amgen Inc. [AMGN] with 367,400
shares valued at $22.1 million; and, General Motors Corp. [GM] with 400,000
shares valued at $20.7 million.

Despite a quarter in which the tech-heavy Nasdaq's plunge seemed
never-ending, the firm remained heavily weighted in the sector, increasing
its tech holdings slightly from approximately 20.5% in the fourth quarter of
2000 to 21.7% in the first quarter of 2001.  Perhaps, the biggest change to
the firm's portfolio was found in its energy sector holdings.  In the fourth
quarter of 2001, approximately 9.3% (valued at $172.5 million) of the firm's
portfolio was invested in energy companies compared to the first quarter of
2001 in which the firm sold approximately three times as much than it
bought.  As of March 31, 2001, Kingdon's energy holdings dropped to 3.3% of
the portfolio with a value of $50.7 million.

The biggest increases were felt in the consumer cyclicals sector, which
represented 10.6% of the firm's portfolio for a value of $196.7 million at
the end of 2000.  As of March 31, 2001, the firm's holdings in the consumer
cyclicals sector increased to 17.4% of the portfolio for a value of $271.4
million.  This increase was led by purchases in General Motors, Ford Motor
Co. [F] with 700,000 shares valued at $19.7 million; Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
[ANF] with 500,000 shares valued at $16.4 million; and, Galileo
International Inc. [GLC] with 724,100 shares valued at $15.9 million.

HEDGE FUND PROFILE: STARO ASSET MANAGEMENT

BRIAN STARK and MICHAEL ROTH met years ago at the prestigious Harvard Law
School.  While both may have intended to pursue very successful careers in
law, they found their success in a very different area.  After graduation,
the duo parted ways; Stark moved to Denver where he handled general
commercial litigation, antitrust law and intellectual property cases.  Roth,
on the other hand, moved to Washington, D.C. where he handled bankruptcy
cases.  It wouldn't be long before Stark would take what was once a hobby
and turn in into his profession.

Investing had always been of great interest to Stark.  According to an
article written by the Business Journal- Milwaukee, while Stark attended law
school he researched and wrote a book on complex investment strategies like
hedging, arbitrage and liquidation. This book was a culmination of his
interest in investing which began at a very early age.  With the knowledge
Stark accumulated over the years in the research and writing of his book and
managing his own money, Stark took this experience and decided to apply it
to his own investment partnership.

Founded in 1987, Staro Asset Management originally opened in New York and
later moved to Mequon, WI in 1993. The firm manages the Shepherd Investments
International, Ltd., Stark Global Fund, Ltd., Stark Europe Fund, Ltd. and
the Stark Investments, L.P. hedge funds.

The firm expanded its investment prowess when it launched BayStar
Management, which manages the Baystar Capital LP hedge fund.  Stark and Roth
are joined in the venture by STEVE LAMAR and LARRY GOLDFARB.  According to
MAR/Hedge, the fund invests in public companies through the purchase of
individually-negotiated, privately-placed securities, relying heavily on
investing in convertible securities.

Staro Asset Management uses a combination of top-down and bottom-up
analysis. In the top-down approach, the firm uses proprietary qualitative
models to screen a global universe of convertible and risk arbitrage
opportunities. The quantitative screens evaluate a convertible's fair value,
attractiveness from a historical perspective, and expected return.
Qualitative factors considered include the fundamentals of the underlying
common stock, short-term supply and demand forces affecting either the
common stock or the convertible security, and default risk. The firm then
relies on its vast experience and expertise to decide which of the uncovered
opportunities are real and which are merely apparent.  The firm will
purchase or short sell a convertible bond, convertible preferred stock,
warrant or option, coupled with the respective short sale or purchase of the
underlying security of which the convertible can be exchanged. Through out
all of the firm's affiliated funds there are no restrictions or limitations
on what sector, market-cap, or country the firm can invest in, thought it
concentrates on the G-7 markets.  It uses the same screening and selection
process in the bottom-up approach applied in uncovering optimal
risk-adjusted opportunities.

The firm's primary objective is to achieve an uncorrelated, absolute return
of 15% to 20%, net of fees. The primary strategy of the firm is convertible
hedging, which typically represents 70% to 90% of overall investing. Other
strategies are used on an opportunistic basis and will differ per fund.  In
its convertible hedging strategy, the firm will take advantage of temporary
mispricings between related securities to create positions that generate
significant streams of cash flow.  The firm finds the most attractively
priced convertible products in out-of-favor sectors.

In a shareholder letter dated May 4, 2001, the firm detailed its outlook on
the global market, stating, ""We have continued to decrease our exposure to
merger arbitrage and re-deploy the capital into other arbitrage strategies
that currently offer much more attractive risk/return profiles.""  The letter
goes on to state that, ""In convertible arbitrage, potential opportunities in
the near term are abundant.""

According to HedgeWorld, Staro Asset Management has approximately $1.5
billion in assets under management.

SHAREHOLDER ACTIVISTS UP THEIR DEMANDS

Many activist funds have continued to grow as a depressed stock market has
left many smaller cap companies with decreasing stock prices, making them
prime targets for corporate raiders and management shake-ups.   Many firms
are reluctant to become too active, instead trying to keep a low profile and
involving themselves when they believe their interest is not being
adequately represented.  Recently, Harvard Management Company entered the
fray when a company it was involved in received a tender offer.  While the
firm felt the tender offer fell short of the company's true value, it had to
take it, unable to persuade other shareholders of its position.

Many socially responsibly funds have also increasingly used proxy statements
to push their own agendas.  BP Amoco Plc - ADR [BP] recently faced a
shareholder proxy that would have forced the company to phase out its
production of oil and gas and instead focus on more environmentally friendly
means of energy production.  The measure failed, but had a good deal of
support from some pension funds and other institutional managers that have
had a record of support for environmental causes.

In a 13G filed in late October 2000, notable financier Carl C. Icahn
declared a 9.9% stake in VISX, Inc. [EYE].  However, Icahn recently failed
in his bid to oust the board of the eye surgery equipment maker.  Icahn had
repeatedly railed again VISX's management, hoping to elect his own nominees
to the company's board.

Memphis, TN-based Southeastern Asset Management, Inc. has made sizable gains
through its activist $3.4 billion Longleaf Partners Fund.  The fund was up
20.6% in an otherwise brutal 2000, and it was up 5.3% through April 30, 2001
according to Morningstar.  The fund is a traditional GARP investor, which
also takes into account, the underlying value of a company in the event of a
turnaround, or outright sale.  Stocks are purchased on current and projected
free cash flow, or cash profits minus expenditures necessary to run the
business.  When evaluating pricing, the firm determines a company's
liquidation value, or the sum of what a company's pieces would sell for on
the open market.

From January 6 to March 2, 2000, Southeastern Asset Management acquired
approximately 8.47 million shares of Aetna, Inc. [AET] according to a 13D
filing with the SEC dated March 8, 2000.  That gave Southeastern a 6.0%
share in the Hartford, CT-based insurer.   Aetna had been battered in the
market and many shareholders wanted to see the company spin off its less
profitable businesses.  In that filing, Southeastern announced its
interaction with other parties to determine the best way to increase Aetna's
true economic value.  About 1.77 million of the shares purchased were for
Southeastern's Longleaf Partners Fund.

""In this situation,"" the filing reported ""Southeastern has had conversations
with third parties, and intends to have additional conversations with these
and one or more other third parties and/or the Issuer's management,
regarding actions or transactions."" Southeastern typically works closely
with management to determine the best way to increase shareholder value.

Aetna had received a joint bid from Dutch financial company ING Group NV and
WellPoint Health Networks. ING was interested in Aetna's financial services
while WellPoint was interested in Aetna's U.S. HealthCare wing.
Southeastern's efforts were foiled, however, when Aetna sold off it's
financial services arm, while holding on to its health care operations.
Since then, Longleaf has slightly eased off on its stake, but still kept the
majority of its holding.

Top five holdings for the Longleaf Partners Fund as of March 31, 2001
included: Marriott International Inc. New [MAR] with 9,966,000 shares
(valued at $410.4 million); Waste Management Inc. Del [WMI] with 15,096,300
shares (valued at $372.9 million); General Motors Corp. [GM] with 5,000,000
shares (valued at $259.3 million); FedEx Corp. [FDX] with 5,615,000 shares
(valued at $234.0 million); and, Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. [YUM] with
5,615,000 shares (valued at $217.3 million).

Other funds have also adopted more intrusive activist programs.  The
California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) believes that good
corporate governance means the difference between short-term setback and
long-term financial difficulty.  CalPERS spent many years simply reacting to
situations, such as takeovers.  The firm has since taken a more proactive
approach to investments in adopting its Corporate Governance Core Principles
and Guidelines to achieve this end.

The firm believes that some measure must be taken to achieve long-term
profitability, but that some investors may not be willing to wait out
short-term difficulties.  The guidelines, however, are not absolute.
CalPERS readily realizes that some firm's are constrained by competitive
pressures, as well as a myriad of other factors.

The firm likes to see independent board members, and an open, shareholder
friendly environment.  This typically means the banning of greenmail and an
accessible CEO who is free of additional constraints and is capable of
acting in the best interests of shareholders.  Most important, in their
evaluation, is the appearance of an independent board of directors.

Hedge fund Wynnefield Capital Management L.L.C. has also recently entered
the fray.  The firm's Wynnefield Partners Small Cap Value L.P. recently
submitted a shareholder proposal to the board of directors at Airgas, Inc.
[ARG]. The firm is pushing for the company to sell itself or to seek out new
strategic partnerships.  The measure will go before shareholders at the
firm's annual meeting in August 2001.

Wynnefield's top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001
included: Sylvan Inc. [SYLN] with 1,068,886 shares (valued at $13.4
million); Pricesmart Inc. [PSMT] with 310,000 shares (valued at $12.1
million); First Aviation Services Inc. [FAVS] with 2,066,892 shares (valued
at $10.1 million); Delta & Pine Land Co. [DLP] with 275,500 shares (valued
at $6.6 million); and, CTB International Corp. [CTBC] with 723,500 shares
(valued at $6.3 million).

Many companies' boards of directors are under increasing outside pressure.
Growing demands on management from shareholders is increasingly an
inevitable part of the future.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  Two large mergers are done deals.  Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in  debt today.  The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed  a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.  The deal more  than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a  producer and distributor of natural gas.  Today ENL brought you interviews  with the CEOs from all four companies.  If you happened to miss it, log onto the ENL website and click on ""video library"" to see the interviews in full.    ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early  tomorrow.  Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov.  Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.  The agenda of the meeting will include  discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California.  Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford.    Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.  Kim Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other  companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.  Be sure  to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.  Later in the week, Kim will  take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua  Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.  Kim says  TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar  panels for use all over the world.  Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light  on the solar panel issue.

He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as the postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy involving Flutie! a! nd rookie Drew Brees. ""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us the next win the next week."" Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder injury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bruener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggl! es! Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Kinney (calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to return to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a risky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's practice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to miss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to start against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated! 1! 1/20/01 Minnis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may have to start in his place,  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Mark Brunell , QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/20/01 Brunell (quadriceps) might miss Sunday's game against Baltimore. Jonathan Quinn will start again if Brunell can't play.  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game against New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the season. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting, meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lineup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA ! - ! Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray right now. ``That's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the starter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play turnover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Shanahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed to play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. ""We'll get a chance to evaluate that during the week and see,"" Shanahan told the Denver Post. ""If he can help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll! k! eep him out and put somebody else in.""   Benjamin Gay , RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how much Gay will play in the near future. ""We'll try to get him involved in some of the games,"" Davis said. ""We'll see.""   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend against Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wide receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will start Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion last weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is best used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the overtime session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't considered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday Indianapolis.   Cecil Martin , RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Martin suffered a hamstring injury during Sunday's game against Dallas. He'll miss a few days of practice, but is expected to play in this weekend's game against Washington. Martin has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Giants , DT NYG - Matty Updated 11/20/01 According to the New York Post, cornerback Jason Sehorn's surgically-repaired right knee began giving him problems again this past weekend. In fact, the team was unsure that he'd be able to cover either Randy Moss or Cris Carter on Monday night, but he played anyway. If he continues to play on a bad wheel, you should consider starting any receivers opposing Sehorn the rest of the season.   Elvis Grbac , QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 The Baltimore Sun says there is no indication that Grbac will be repl! ac! ed as the team's starting QB. Still, he is not performing well enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Driver is still dealing with a thigh injury, and is expected to miss Thursday's game against Detroit. The reserve wideout has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.    Ravens , DT BAL - Russell Updated 11/20/01 Defensive end Michael McCrary will miss the rest of the season after undergoing knee surgery. His loss will certainly lower the sack output of the Baltimore defense and may mean the team will allow more passing yardage than usual.    Cowboys , DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Linebacker Dexter Coakley, who was expected to miss two weeks due to a sprained knee, will likely get the start on Thursday after being out for just one game. He'll help keep Denver's running game in check, but don't expect his presence to give Dallas' defense added Fantasy value as a whole.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/20/01 Smith (knee) will start on Thursday's game against Denver. ""I'm not 100 percent, but I'm healthy enough to do my job,"" Smith told the Dallas Morning Star. He'll struggle to post solid Fantasy numbers due to Dallas' horrid passing game, so bench him this week if at all possible.     Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/20/01 Hayes suffered bruised ribs during Sunday's game against San Francisco. He may miss some practice time this week, but he's expected to play this weekend against Atlanta. The Falcons secondary is one of the worst in the league, so Hayes could turn into a good sleeper pick in Week 11.   Terry Hardy , TE ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Hardy is expected to return to practice this week after missing three games due to shoulder injury. However, he is not certain to play on Sunday against San Diego.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Harris is out for Thursday's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. Harris has been an unreliable Fantasy player and is only worth a roster spot in deeper leagues.   More Updates  [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Welch Foods Inc.","I got a call from Jason Williams on this file.  As it turns out, in his review of the annual report of Welch he noted that it stated that Welch is a cooperative.  The original draft of the ISDA was not drafted with this knowledge as there was no indication from any source that Welch was a cooperative.  This fact needs to be confirmed, and if Welch is a cooperative, you will need to research the issue.  I attach for you a letter of issues  sent to outside counsel last year when we were investigating another proposed cooperative counterparty.  Hope this will help.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Gone digital
Companies with digital in their names seem to be on a roll.

By Dave Sterman

Whats in a name? Plenty, if youre talking about the word ""digital.""
Screening for fast-growing Net stocks, we found that three of them use
that ubiquitous moniker in their title. Recently, we chronicled the bright
prospects for Digital Insight (DGIN).

This week, were looking at the other digitals, and found a pretty
ompelling investment case for each of those as well. Both DigitalThink
(DTHK) and Digital River (DRIV) are taking advantage of the unique selling
properties associated with the Web.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Charge!!!
Consumers came to the rescue of retailers, and individual investors
will come to the rescue of the street.

by Charles Payne, founder, chief executive officer and principal analyst, Wall
Street Strategies

Last week saw a marked contrast to the previous week as the Northern Alliance
went from the Keystone Cops to a liberating rebel force, pushing the Taliban
back on their heels (or on their toes, as they scatter to caves and tunnels in
the southern part of Afghanistan). Wall Street mavens and the media suggested
that stocks were pushed higher by the war victories, and while I agree that
the prospect of a short war is a positive element for the market, I believe
that the week's success had some domestic ingredients as well. In fact, I think
the most telling moment of the week came when retail sales figures were released
last Wednesday, once again beating expectations.

In the previous week, many observers were surprised to see that consumer
sentiment (as monitored by the Michigan survey) came in well above estimates,
and was quickly dismissed as some type of fluke. After last week, though, I
dont think anyone can question the resolve of the American consumer.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Stimulus is the key going forward
Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may
generate a further market rally.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining
what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the
market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday
session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy,
nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an
abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that
Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it
was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type
car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks
that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and
even entertaining, but of no enduring value.

It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the
grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby,
gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have
happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill.
Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the
day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when
left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are
earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment,
fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a
high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as
easy as it looks.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Models of success?
Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share
prices may still be too high for some.

By Dave Sterman

In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year
for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other
weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter.

But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space,
as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This
week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in
the ""survivor"" category.

We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a
heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their
shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain?

His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see! s! ome work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Road Rage Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - AARP Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - AARP Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacksonville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Internet Potatoes U! pd! ated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Threesome Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.   Jerry Rice , WR OAK - The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. Rice may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right.   Jon Kitna , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Kitna put up 234! y! ards passing and a touchdown against Tennessee, but two interceptions made his performance mediocre. He's no better than a reserve Fantasy player at this point, best used when the matchup is right in a deeper league.   Koren Robinson , WR SEA - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 Robinson caught two passes for 15 yards at Buffalo, including his first career TD, a seven-yarder. Robinson is slowly improving, but still does not produce enough to be a reliable Fantasy player.  Corey Dillon , RB CIN - The Flounders Updated 11/18/01 Dillon was held in check by Tennessee, rushing for only 38 yards on Sunday. However, with all the injured running backs around the league this season, Dillon is still a must-start on a weekly basis.   Steve McNair , QB TEN - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/18/01 McNair played despite a sore thumb, throwing for 172 yards and a touchdown against Cincinnati. He's been an unreliable Fantasy player this season, and is worth starting only when the matchup is right.   Eddie George , RB TEN - Hollowman Updated 11/18/01 George was unimpressive once again,! p! osting only 65 scrimmage yards on Sunday against Cincinnati. He just doesn't seem to be at full speed this season, and has been a huge Fantasy disappointment.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/18/01 Williams had a big game on Sunday, rushing for 120 yards and a touchdown against Indianapolis. He continues to prove his value as a Fantasy player, and is a must-start ever week.   Aaron Brooks , QB NO - Road Rage Updated 11/18/01 Brooks had an outstanding game against Indianapolis, throwing for 249 yards and two touchdowns. He's put together two straight solid games, and may finally be reaching the potential the coaching staff knew he was capable of.   Peyton Manning , QB IND - Little Bambinos Updated 11/18/01 Manning put up a decent performance against New Orleans, posting 262 yards and a touchdown. He may not be putting up Manning-like numbers this season, but he's still far too valuable to ever consider benching.   Marcus Pollard , TE IND - AARP Updated 11/18/01 Poll! ar! d had a huge game on Sunday, catching three passes for 126 yards and a touchdown against New Orleans. He may not be the most consistent Fantasy player, but the lack of tight end depth around the league makes him a valuable commodity.   Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - AARP Updated 11/18/01 McNabb was unimpressive on Sunday, compiling only 153 scrimmage yards and a touchdown against Dallas. Despite the mediocre performance, McNabb is still one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the league.   Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Leaf was horrible for the second straight week, throwing for only 102 yards with two interceptions. Incidently, both picks were returned for touchdowns as Dallas fell to Philadelphia, 36-3.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Little Bambinos Updated 11/18/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia in the second half with an apparent knee injury. He did not return to the game, and finished the day with 90 scrimmage yards and a fumble.   More Updates  Transactions, View !

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	   Dear Jason,  California may see rolling blackouts again today, and ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford may get to experience them firsthand.  Jay is in Sacramento covering the meeting between Gov. Gray Davis and the CEOs of several power providers.  This afternoon, Jay brought us an interview with Gov. Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio.  For those of you who missed the 4:00 p.m. EST broadcast, you can log onto ENL and find the full Maviglio interview in the ""Video Library.""    While Jay is still in Sacramento, ENL's Burke Moeller and Peter Cook are holding down the fort in Washington, D.C.  Burke says the D.C. bureau is waiting for the changes in Chairman Joe Barton's Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  The bill calls for some measures in short-term relief, but doesn't mention price caps on wholesale power.  The markup is scheduled for tomorrow.  The Washington bureau is also keeping tabs on Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham as he testifies before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  These are just a few developing stories that the D.C. bureau will be following tomorrow.         We'll head south from D.C. to Houston where correspondent Kim Benestante tomorrow is scheduled to speak with University of Houston professor Dr. Barton Smith.

  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

*May 22, 2001- Wachovia Corp. board of directors has decided to reject
SunTrust Banks hostile takeover bid and instead pursue the proposed merger
agreement with First Union Corp.  Although there were numerous reasons for
the board's decision, a press release issued by Wachovia stated that,
""SunTrust is very inexperienced in integration activities, having completed
only one transaction with a value greater the $100 million in the past 10
years.  The Wachovia transaction is three times larger than any integration
attempted to date and is twice as large as the combined assets of all
acquisitions completed in the last 10 years.""   As a result, SunTrust is
initiating litigation in Georgia against Wachovia Corp. and its board
members as well as First Union.

CAXTON BOOSTS ASSETS UNDER MANAGEMENT

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bruce Kovner's Caxton Corporation
reported $9.8 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 1,799
stocks. The firm's assets increased approximately $2.4 billion from the
previous quarter in which the firm reported $7.4 billion in equity assets
invested in a portfolio of 1,841 companies.

Caxton's most heavily weighted sectors remained relatively consistent from
the fourth quarter of 2000 to the first quarter of 2001.  For the quarter
ended March 31, 2001, technology held the top spot with 20.3%.  Other
heavily weighted sectors included consumer cyclicals (14.3%), financials
(14.0%), consumer staples (9.4%), and capital goods (7.8%).

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Freddie Mac
[FRE] with 848,000 shares valued at $55.0 million; Tyco International Ltd.
[TYC] with 1,190,396 shares valued at $51.5 million; Quaker Oats Co. [OAT]
with 515,300 shares valued at $50.0 million; Honeywell International Inc.
[HON] with 1,207,100 shares valued at $49.2 million; and, Fannie Mae [FNM]

firm also established new stakes in American Home Products Corp. [AHP] with
821,600 shares valued at $48.3 million and Tosco Corp. [TOS] with 856,100

-----------------------------------------------------------

TUDOR REDUCES EXPOSURE TO TECHNOLOGY

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Tudor Investment Corporation reported
approximately $2.3 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 173
companies.  This was a decrease from the previous quarter in which the firm
reported approximately $3.1 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio
of 240 companies.

Tudor's most heavily weighted sectors for the quarter included consumer
cyclicals with 20.7%, consumer staples with 15.6%, health care with 13.5%,
technology with 8.9%, and diversified with 8.9%.  Since December 31, 1999,
when the technology portion of Tudor's portfolio comprised approximately
55.8%, the firm has gradually been trimming its allocation to the sector.
The biggest drop came between June 30, 2000 and September 30, 2000, when the
firm's 13F reported that technology holdings had dropped from 43.8% to
24.0%.  Eight months later, holdings are only a third of what they once
were, reflecting the markets souring on the tech sector.

Top holdings for the quarter included: Becton Dickinson & Co. [BDX] with
3,192,900 shares valued at $112.8 million; Philip Morris Cos. Inc. [MO] with
2,021,400 shares valued at $95.9 million; Nasdaq 100 Trust [QQQ] with

million; Albertsons Inc. [ABS] with 1,416,400 shares valued at $45.1
million; American International Group Inc. [AIG] with 505,000 shares valued
at $40.7 million; and, AnnTaylor Stores [ANN] with 1,345,100 shares valued
at $35.7 million.

VIKING GLOBAL: PARTIAL TO COMMUNICATION SERVICES

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Viking Global Investors, the firm
founded by former Tiger Management Managing Director O. Andreas Halvorsen,
reported $1.47 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 55
companies.  This was a minimal decrease from the previous quarter in which
the firm reported approximately $1.49 billion in equity assets invested in a
portfolio of 52 companies.

Viking Global remains fairly concentrated in a few select sectors, a method
that has clearly worked well for the firm so far.  According to a February
2001 article in Business Week, the firm was up approximately 89% last year
after fees.  For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm's most heavily
weighted sectors included communication services with 36.9%, consumer
cyclicals with 34.1%, consumer staples with 10.9%, financials with 9.8%, and
technology with 4.1%.

Top holdings for the quarter included Sprint Corp. (PCS) [PCS] with
8,502,200 shares valued at $161.5 million; Centurytel Inc. [CTL] with
4,095,400 shares valued at $117.7 million; BCE Inc. [BCE] with 4,589,600
shares valued at $103.3 million; Ross Stores Inc. [ROST] with 4,103,500
shares valued at $76.9 million; and TJX Cos. Inc. [TJX] with 2,181,800
shares valued at $69.8 million.

Two out of the top three new positions and three out of the top five largest
buys were from the communication services sector.  New holdings for the
quarter included Clear Channel Communications Inc. [CCU] with 810,00 shares
valued at $44.1 million; AT & T [T] with 1,298,000 shares valued at $27.6
million; SBC Communications Inc. [SBC] with 587,000 shares valued at $26.2
million; McDonalds Corp. [MCD] with 931,000 shares valued at $24.7 million;
and, Dollar General Corp. [DG] with 1,141,700 shares valued at $23.3
million.

DIGITAL CENTURY STICKS TO TECHNOLOGY
For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Digital Century reported
ownership of 24 companies valued at $294.8 million, a marked decrease from
the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 30 companies valued
at $552.5 million.  As recently as September 30, 2000, the firm had reported
ownership of 29 companies valued at $889.8 million.
Throughout recent quarters, the firm's portfolio P/E ratio has been nearly
double that of the S&P 500.  As many other firms' portfolio P/Es have fallen
in the wake of the dot-com boom, Digital Century's P/E has remained high,
seemingly making it an aggressive, aggressive growth player.  The firm, long
a technology player, was founded in 1998 by former Goldman Sachs
semiconductor analyst RAJIV CHAUDHRI to focus on the booming tech sector.
Overall, the firm had 78.0% of its holdings invested in the technology
sector for the first quarter.
In its most recent quarter, the firm made small moves into computer
software, specialty communications, and communications.  Companies in the
electronics, entertainment, and services (commercial consumer) decreased the
largest amount.
Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: eBay Inc.
[EBAY] with 1,818,000 shares (valued at $65.8 million); AOL Time Warner Inc.
[AOL] with 1,414,000 shares (valued at $56.8 million); Exodus Communications
Inc. [EXDS] with 1,586,000 shares (valued at $17.0 million); Globespan Inc.
[GSPN] with 760,000 shares (valued at $16.6 million); and, BEA Systems Inc.
[BEAS] with 425,000 shares (valued at $12.5 million).
Interestingly, the firm took no new positions for the quarter.  The firm
did, however, add to preexisting positions.  Companies added to in the
firm's portfolio included: Exodus Communications [EXDS]; Veritas Software
Corp. [VRTS] with 266,650 shares (valued at $12.3 million); BEA Systems Inc.
[BEAS]; Yahoo Inc. [YHOO] with 734,000 shares (valued at $11.6 million);
and, Globespan Inc. [GSPN].

SECOND CURVE MOVES INTO REGIONAL BANKS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Second Curve Capital reported
ownership of 25 companies valued at $279.6 million, an increase from the
previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 25 companies valued at
$213.5 million.  Former Tiger Management and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
banking analyst Thomas K. Brown founded the firm in 2000.  The firm's
investments reflect Brown's background; the firm invests primarily in the
financials sector.

In its most recent filing, financials account for 98.5% of the portfolio,
with a miniscule 1.5% invested in technology.  The top three micro sector
holdings included consumer finance (29.7%), savings & loan companies
(27.6%), and banks (regional) (20.4%).  Over the quarter, the firm rotated
out of diversified financial companies and brokerages while moving into more
traditional banking stocks including companies in the banks (regional),
banks (money center), and consumer finance sectors.

Brown has gained some notoriety in the news from his very public criticism
of Bank of America.  The New York Times referred to Brown as a ""bomb
thrower"" when describing his fervent criticism of Bank of America Corp.'s
management.  In frequent postings to his website, bankstocks.com, Brown has
made numerous negative postings, including one titled ""Bank of America: The
Reign of Terror Continues,"" and has directly criticized Bank of America CEO
Hugh McColl.  Interestingly enough, Second Curve's largest purchase for the
quarter was 300,148 shares of Bank of America.

Top five new purchases included: Bank of America Corp. [BAC] with 300,148
shares (valued at $16.4 million); Sovereign Bancorp Inc. [SVRN] with
1,926,645 shares (valued at $16.3 million); First Union Corp. [FTU] with
481,247 shares (valued at $15.9 million); Americredit Corp. [ACF] with
118,072 shares (valued at $3.8 million); and, Hibernia Corp. (Cl A) [HIB]
with 260,226 shares (valued at $3.6 million).

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Household
International Inc. [HI] with 1,009,557 shares (valued at $59.8 million); TCF
Financial [TCB] with 712,551 shares (valued at $26.9 million); Capital One
Financial Corp. [COF] with 352,975 shares (valued at $19.6 million); Pacific
Century Financial Corp. [BOH] with 873,664 shares (valued at $16.6 million);
and, Bank of America Corp. [BAC] with 300,148 shares (valued at $16.4
million).

ABN AMRO EXPANDS EQUITY RESEARCH TEAM THROUGH ACQUISITION OF ING BARINGS

ABN AMRO announced on January 30, 2001 that it reached an agreement with ING
Group to purchase the prime brokerage, corporate finance, domestic equities,
and futures and options businesses of ING Barings in North America for
$275.0 million.  This acquisition assisted ABN AMRO in its effort to offer a
globally integrated corporate and investment banking service for its
corporate, financial institution and public sector clients.

ABN AMRO completed the acquisition of ING Barings in North America on April
30, 2001.  The acquisition strengthened ABN AMRO's investment banking and
research divisions in a number of sectors, including media, energy, telecom,
industrial manufacturing and healthcare, in addition to rounding out the
firm's existing sector coverage.  The number of U.S. stocks followed by ABN
AMRO will double from their current levels. The acquisition also enables the
firm to significantly boost its trading capacity over the next two years.

Over 1,300 of ING Barings' personnel are expected to transfer with the sale
of the U.S. investment banking business to ABN AMRO.   The majority of ING
Barings' former U.S. research staff has been transferred to ABN AMRO. ABN
AMRO is also expecting to dismiss approximately 1000 employees globally,
with about 100 staff dismissals within the U.S. investment banking business
it bought from ING Barings.

ING Group was intent on greatly reducing its North American investment
banking presence, as a result of stiffer competition from the larger
recently consolidated investment banking entities that were created over the
past two years.  ING remains committed to investment banking in Europe, Asia
and Latin America.  In addition, the firm's asset management divisions,
Baring Asset Management and ING Furman Selz Asset Management, will continue
to operate as a part of ING's global asset management division.

Many members of the firm's equity research team have chosen to pursue
opportunities elsewhere, including: FRANK MARSALA, formerly a vice president
and senior wireless telecommunications analyst with ING Barings, who joined
Robertson Stephens; ROBERT J. HOEHN, ING Barings' former director of equity
research, who joined Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein as the director of North
American equity research, and THOMAS LAURIA, a former telecommunications
equipment analyst with ING Barings LLC.

*Oil Services: STEPHEN D. GENGARO

"Seduce Women Instantly!!","S e x u a l l y Attract- -Women Instantly with  nature's  secret weapon... Pher-o-mones!!               _s23*

Invisible and undetectable, when unknowingly inhaled by any woman, Attraxx Pher-o-mone Concentrate for men unblocks all restraints and releases her  raw  animal s-e-x drive!

This amazing product is sold in stores for $99.95 a bottle. Our price is less... MUCH LESS! This is the strongest concentration of HUMAN Pher-o-mones, allowed by law, in an essential oil base. It smells great!

Other men will envy your power and success! Wear it just as you would any cologne and women will be instantly attracted to you. Human Pher-o-mones have been proven to induce s-e-x-ual desire in women - ALL WOMEN - even the stubborn one's who were unreceptive to you before! This astonishing fragrance attracts women like  magic!

However, It's not magic - it's science!

Pher-o-mones: Nature's  secret  attractant!

Have you ever noticed how some men are able to attract  any woman they want with hardly any effort? This phenomenon used to be known as 'Animal-Magnetism'. Many scientists now believe that this attraction is due to Pher-o-mones - subtle body odors that are not  consciously detected, but trigger a subconscious  s-e-x-u-a-l response in the opposite  s-e-x.

For years animal  Pher-o-mones have been used to induce breeding  in  livestock, but only recently has Human Pher-o-mone Extract become available and legal in the U.S.

For the first time, in the late 80s, researchers were able to successfully isolate the human Pher-o-mone,  Attraxx, found in human  sweat. Scientists in Israel have recently found a way to synthetically reproduce this naturally occurring aphro-disiac in the laboratory.

This is the one and the ONLY chemical that really  attracts  women!

No other chemical or compound - natural or synthetic - produces even a tenth of the excitement in women as Attraxx Pher-o-mone  Concentrate

The announcement of this scientific breakthrough, set off a media fire-storm. In the last few years, the remarkable aphrodisiac qualities of Attraxx Pher-o-mones have been featured in every major publication, newspaper, national magazine, and television magazine. From 20/ 20, Hard  Copy, and Dateline  NBC, to the N.Y. times, and the American Journal of Modern Medicine.

Many independent research institutes have conducted studies on the benefits of Attraxx (You may have heard about the most recent study on CNN.) Researchers at the University of Kentucky found that women exposed to pictures of men that had been sprayed with Attraxx found the men far more s-e-xually attractive than the photos of men that had not been treated.


Attraxx: Human  Pher-o-mone
In one study, Attraxx was put through an eight week double blind placebo controlled scientific study. The results were incredible! Single men who were using Attraxx, reported suddenly being approached by women in public,  women  making eye contact, initiating  conversations, etc. Not surprisingly, they were found to have s.e.x far more often than the men who were not using Attraxx.

In another reported experiment, twin brothers were used in testing. Only one of the twins was sprayed with the actual Pher-o-mones. Women found the brother wearing the actual Attraxx concentrate, far more s-e-xuallly attractive than the other. Now, remember these were identical twins. But time and again, the women found the twin wearing the human Pher-o-mone more  attractive hands down.

Attraxx Pher-o-mone  Concentrate

There are a number of companies that are selling a blend of Pher-o-mones, typically masked in a musk-like  cologne. While a few actually contain synthetic human Pher-o-mones, most do not. Typically, Pher-o-mone colognes / body oils contain a mixture of animal or insect Pher-o-mones. This is great if you want to attract grasshoppers or pigs, but does little to help a man in search of female companionship.

The Real Thing!

Rather than adding Pher-o-mones to an existing cologne, it is our belief, that it is far more effective to blend a significant amount of pure Attraxx with a non obtrusive oil base. This creates the strongest  concentration of human Pher-o-mones legally available anywhere! THIS IS THE ONLY PHER-O-MONE OIL PROVEN TO REALLY WORK! Accept no substitutes!

Incredibly Powerful!

Just a small application of Attraxx Pher-o-mone Concentrate, and you will suddenly notice women making eye contact, approaching you at the supermarket, etc. GUARANTEED! Without changing anything else about your presentation, women will suddenly be far more receptive to your advances.

Sold in stores for $99.95 a bottle (and WELL worth that!) we can offer it to you directly for only $29.95!!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Can equipment makers overcome a capex slowdown in 2002?
Analysts believe that a few stocks are worth buying despite continued belt
tightening.

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

The 2002 capex picture for large carriers is coming into focus, and it isn't
pretty. The push to control spending will continue, and capex budgets look
to be slashed by an average of 25 percent next year.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Better safe than sorry
In an insecure world, Corporate America is investing in security software

By Carla Drysdale

If you're like me, a ""virus warning"" in your email inbox isn't likely to faze you.
You click on it and glance through it, with a vague sense of gratitude that
the warning will hopefully prevent your computer from imploding.

So at first I took it in stride when I received a message saying: ""If you receive
an email entitled 'Bad Times,' delete it IMMEDIATELY. Apparently this one is
pretty nasty.""

I thought, okay, and I kept reading. ""It will not only erase everything on your
hard drive, but it will also delete anything on disks within 20 feet of your
computer...It will do all your drugs and drink all your liquor."" Now that's a nasty
virus! While this science fiction scenario might have been written by someone
who's seen The Matrix once too often, it is a tongue-in-cheek reminder that smart
hackers can wreak all kinds of havoc.

Fortunately for the makers of anti-virus software, Fortune 100 companies are
acutely aware of the problem, and they are keeping security software firms busier
than ever--and that makes them an attractive target for private equity as well.

Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Advent Software (ADVS)
What can you say about a tech stock that analysts tout even while estimates
drop? How about: Nice!

By Marc Gerstein

Usually analysts like stocks when earnings are growing, and they are most
bullish on shares of companies whose earnings growth is especially strong.
That's a major reason why tech stocks have been in the doghouse lately.
Earnings have been heading south. Whether or not you want to invest in tech
now generally depends on how patient you are. If you're willing to get in early and
wait until earnings recover and estimates get revised upward (something that will
probably be occurring around mid-2002), this is a great time to jump in. If you're
not so patient, you have to agonize trying to guess the timing of recovery.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining
analyst esteem.

by Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of
analyst esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest
rating, but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an
average rating better than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an
average rating of 2 (""buy""). What gives?

-----------------------------------------------------------

NEWS

*As a result of the merger between Milwaukee-based Firstar Corporation and
Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp on February 27, 2001, the asset management

name.

*The TD Asset Management 13F filing for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 now
includes the assets of the Canada Trust Group of Companies, including the

TD.

*Following the recent break-up of Pequot Capital Management and technology
guru Dan Benton, San Mateo, CA-based hedge fund Bowman Capital is rumored to
be following suit. In an article in Barron's on Saturday May 12, 2001, it
was announced the Bowman's two principals, Larry Bowman and John Hurley,
might be going their separate ways.

The firm manages the Spinnaker Technology Fund, L.P., the Spinnaker Offshore
Fund, LTD, the Spinnaker Crossover Fund, the Spinnaker Founders Fund, and
Offshore Founders Fund, LTD. As of December 31, 2001, Bowman managed
approximately $4.2 billion in equity assets according to a 13F filed with
the SEC. This was a significant decrease from the quarter before when the
firm reported $9.8 billion in equity assets invested in approximately 170
companies.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bowman Capital
reported ownership of 116 companies, valued at $3.0 billion.

*Effective June 1, 2001, MFS Investment Management and Jennison Associates

American Odyssey Core Equity Fund is now known as the CitiStreet Large
Company Stock Fund; the American Odyssey Emerging Opportunities Fund is now
the CitiStreet Small Company Stock Fund; and, the American Odyssey
International Equity Fund is now the CitiStreet International Stock Fund.

*Sources at Fidelity Management & Research have stated that there may have
been a bug in the firm's reporting system that affected some filings. This
may have caused some ownership declines to be overstated. For example, the
reported position of AOL Time Warner was 100 shares when in fact the actual
position was 113,814,663 shares. Fidelity restated its holdings in an
amended 13F filing on May 16, 2001.

-----------------------------------------------------------

13F: IRRECONCILABLE DIFFERECES: BOWMAN AND PEQUOT FACE BREAKUPS

Following the collapse of Long Term Capital Management, a number of the
remaining billion-dollar hedge funds have continued to be troubled by poor
investment returns and management shake-ups.  With Julian Robertson and
George Soros out of the picture, some of the smaller funds have continued to
drop out of the running or morph their institutions.  The recent months and
days of 2001 have seen the breakup of Pequot Capital Management's ARTHUR
SAMBERG and DANIEL BENTON and the reported breakup of Bowman Capital's LARRY
BOWMAN and JOHN HURLEY.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Bowman Capital reported
ownership of 116 companies, valued at $3.0 billion, a sharp decline from the
previous quarter, when the firm reported ownership of 132 companies, valued
at $4.2 billion.  One year ago, for the first quarter of 2000, Bowman
reported ownership of 224 companies valued at $12.0 billion.

Bowman first made a name for itself riding the cusp of the technology boom.
The firm aggressively invested in technology while hedging its bets.  One
year ago, the firm's average portfolio P/E was neatly double the average P/E
of the S&P 500.  It has since fallen dramatically, to only slightly above
the S&P.

In an article in Barron's on Saturday May 12, 2001, it was reported that
Bowman's two principals, Larry Bowman and John Hurley, would be going their
separate ways.  The firm has not responded.  The breakup, it is widely
believed, is a result of lagging performance in a difficult market.  While
the firm shorts and hedges against potential downturns, the firm's
technology focus may have left it few places to hide.  Bowman has also made
notable efforts in recent years to expand its involvement in private equity
and mezzanine financing.  It even opened a new office in London to focus on
European venture capital.

During the dot.com boom, venture capital was an excellent way to get
involved in high-tech companies on the ground floor.  As the IPO market has
shriveled up and technology stocks have fallen out of favor, Bowman has been
left holding long positions in companies that benefited from an opening IPO
pop, but that suffered following the downturn.  One such example was
fiber-optic communications equipment maker Oni Systems Corp. [ONIS].  Bowman
was on the ground floor of the company, supplying it with private financing.
Shortly after the firm's 2000 IPO, the stock reached an all time high of
142.0.  On May 17, 2001, the company closed at 33.15.

Bowman's top five new purchases for the quarter included: Lexmark
International Inc. [LXK] with 1,000,000 shares (valued at $45.5. million);
Compaq Computer Corp. [CPQ] with 2,220,000 shares (valued at $40.4 million);
Mercury Interactive Corp. [MERQ] with 800,000 shares (valued at $33.5
million); Rambus Inc. Del [RMBS] with 1,600,000 shares (valued at $33.0
million); and, Apple Computer with 1,379,600 shares (valued at $30.4
million).

Bowman's top five holdings for the first quarter included: Microsoft Corp.
[MSFT] with 6,258,100 shares (valued at $342.2 million); EMC Corp MA [EMC]
with 5,372,000 shares (valued at $157.9 million); Qualcomm Inc. [QCOM] with
2,746,240 shares (valued at $155.5 million); Oracle Corp. [ORCL] with
8,568,500 shares (valued at $128.4 million); and, Sonus Networks Inc. [SONS]
with 6,400,000 shares (valued at $127.7 million).

Arthur Samberg and Daniel Benton, the managers and founding partners of
hedge fund giant Pequot Capital Management, are also ending their
partnership, it was reported last month.  Benton is reportedly leaving to
run his own hedge fund, Andor Capital Management. Samberg will remain at
Pequot and continue to manage the Westport, CT-based firm.

The split, it has been reported, was not a result of poor performance, or
souring market conditions; such conditions were responsible for the downfall
of Soros Fund Management and Julian Robertson's Tiger Management. The split
is reportedly a result of differing opinions and visions of Pequot's future.
Benton, a technology specialist, wanted to continue to make large bets, long
or short, on technology, while Samberg was interested in further
diversification. The fund has also struggled under a growing asset base. In
a letter to shareholders following the fourth quarter, the firm reported in
excess of $15 billion in net assets under management. However, in its 13F,
filed for the quarter ended December 31, 2000, the firm reported ownership
of 493 companies, valued at $7.6 billion, a sharp decrease from the first
quarter of 2000, when the firm reported ownership of 517 companies valued at
$16.5 billion.  For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm's
reported equity asset declined again, to a reported ownership of 563
companies, valued at $6.4 billion.

Pequot's top five new purchases included: Qwest Communications International
Inc. [Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts
[ERTS] with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Philip Morris Cos
Inc. [MO] with 2,300,000 shares (valued at $109.1 million); NTT DoCoMo Inc.
with 6,065 shares (valued at $105.5 million); and, Invitrogen Corp. [IVGN]
with 1,779,000 shares (valued at $97.6 million).

Pequot's top five holdings included: Qwest Communications International Inc.
[Q] with 5,608,900 shares (valued at $196.6 million); Electronic Arts [ERTS]
with 3,617,100 shares (valued at $196.2 million); Pfizer Inc. [PFE] with
4,722,853 shares (valued at $193.4 million); Curagen Inc. [CRGN] with
6,450,500 shares (valued at $151.2 million); and, Incyte Genomics Inc.

13F: ORIGIN CAPITAL MAINTAINS DEVOTION TO HEALTH CARE

Founded in 2000, San Francisco-based hedge fund Origin Capital Management
hit the ground running in its first year in operation.  Launched at a time
when the markets were on very shaky ground, the firm reported $620.9 million
in equity assets for its first 13F filing for the quarter ended December 31,
2000.  Walter ""Buzz"" Burlock, a former Soros Fund Management managing
director, spearheaded this new venture to invest in both public and pre-IPO
companies predominately in the health care sector.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $428.3 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 96 companies, a decrease of
approximately $200.0 million dollars from the prior quarter.

Not surprisingly, health care and biotechnology were the most heavily
weighted sectors in Origin's portfolio.  Approximately, 52.4% of the
portfolio was invested in biotech companies, followed by health care, which
comprised 23.7% of the portfolio.  Consumer staples was the next most
heavily weighted sector, with 10.2% of the portfolio, giving it a slight
edge over drugs/pharmaceuticals, which comprised 7.3% of the portfolio.

Although the majority of the portfolio (50.2%) fell in the large-cap arena,
there was a fairly large representation of mid- and small-cap companies,
with 21.2% and 28.6%, respectively.

New positions for the quarter included a 200,000 share position in Elan
Plc-ADR [ELN]; a 200,000 share position in Alza Corp. [AZA] valued at $8.1
million; 150,000 shares of AstraZeneca Plc-ADR [AZN] valued at $7.2 million;
100,000 shares of Bristol Myers Squibb Co.  [BMY] valued at $5.9 million;
and, 80,800 shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.- ADR [TEVA] with
80,800 shares valued at $4.4 million.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001, included: McKesson
HBOC Inc. [MCK] with 1,218,600 shares valued at $32.6 million; Boston
Scientific Corp. [BSX] with 1,607,000 shares valued at $32.4 million; Biogen
Inc. [BGEN] with 510,000 shares valued at $32.3 million; Genentech Inc.
[DNA] with 536,200 with $27.1 million; and, Quintiles Transnational Corp.
[QTRN] with 807,450 shares valued at $15.2 million.

-----------------------------------------------------------

13F: GALLEON FAVORS BIOTECH, COMPUTERS

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Galleon Management L.P. reported
ownership of 131 companies valued at $1.2 billion, a decline from the
previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 105 companies valued at
$1.7 billion.  It most recent filing is a notable decline from less than a
year ago, when the firm reported ownership of 147 companies valued at over
$2.7 billion.

The high profile fund run by hedge fund guru Raj Rajaratnam is just one of
several hedge funds that have seen their assets under management decrease
amid a slumping technology market.  Recent weeks and months have seen high
profile splits in hedge funds such as Pequot Management Inc. and Bowman
Capital Management, L.L.C.

Top five micro sector weightings for the firm included biotechnology with
12.8%, computer hardware (10.9%), computer software (10.9%), health care
(drugs/pharmaceuticals) (10.1%), and computers (networking) (9.0%).

Some of the firm's expanded interest in the biotech and health care sectors
may be a result of the recent addition of SAMUEL NAVARRO.  Navarro, formerly
a managing director and sell-side global head of Health Care Corporate
Finance at ING Barings, recently joined the firm as an analyst and managing
director of the Galleon Group Health Care Fund.  Navarro's addition follows
the departure of PREM LACHMAN, formerly a partner and portfolio manager
providing coverage of the pharmaceuticals, contract services and
distribution sector.  Lachman launched his own venture, Maximus Capital,
with the help of former Moore Capital Management professional Joanne Soja
and former Morgan Stanley Dean Witter portfolio manager Teresa McRoberts.

Many of Galleon's other offerings tend to weigh more heavily in tech,
including the Galleon Omni Fund (formerly known as Needham Omni Fund), the
Calypso Advisors LLC and Needham Emerging Growth Partners, LP.

Top five holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Corvis
Corp. [CORV] with 11,050,000 shares (valued at $77.7 million); Nasdaq 100
Trust [QQQ] with 1,850,000 shares (valued at $72.4 million); Microsoft Corp.
[MSFT] with 1,050,000 shares (valued at $57.4 million); Compaq Computer
Corp. [CPQ] with 2,000,500 shares (valued at $36.4 million); and, Gateway
Inc. [GTW] with 2,094,800 shares (valued at $35.2 million).

Top five new purchases included the firm's largest holdings: switching and
routing equipment maker Corvis Corp. as well as Compaq and Gateway.
Rounding out the top five are Texas Instruments Inc. [TXN] with 1,000,000
shares (valued at $31.0 million) and Exodus Communications Inc. [EXDS] with
2,050,000 shares (valued at $22.0 million).

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  On Thursday, ENL's Stephanie Stanton is traveling to Florida to cover the groundbreaking ceremony for the new Gulfstream Natural Gas Pipeline.  The 744-mile pipeline is a joint venture between Duke Energy and Williams Energy, the parent company of ENL.  Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Alabama Governor Don Siegelman are scheduled to attend the ceremony, and we're crossing our fingers for a chance to speak with the governors about several issues.  Log on Thursday for coverage from Florida.   Tuesday, California Gov. Gray Davis threatened to bring a lawsuit against the FERC.  ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says the bureau will follow the developments surrounding Gov. Davis and the FERC on Thursday.  Jay also reports, an important deadline for the FERC Market Monitoring and Mitigation Order is coming up on Friday.  The Cal ISO has until the close of business Friday, June 1 to submit an RTO proposal to the FERC.  The Washington bureau is scheduled to discuss all the action surrounding the FERC on Thursday.        ENL has a lot going on from the Houston bureau tomorrow as well.  Correspondent Kim Benestante says there is a report out saying power deregulation in Pennsylvania has failed.  The Houston bureau will bring us details and compare and contrast deregulation in Pennsylvania with Texas.  Kim also reports, Texas' Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railways will complete the industry's first coal-transportation option auction.  We'll have these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Thursday.    Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Centric Energy Group Principal Tom Gilhooley is scheduled to join us.  He's dropping by the bureau to discuss NYMEX crude and gasoline prices.  Be sure to catch the Gilhooley interview in the noon ET newscast.

 	 	   Dear Jason,  Two people are injured, one seriously, after an explosion rocks the hemisphere's largest oil refinery.  A fire at the Hovensa refinery on the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Croix may have an effect on gasoline prices.  Officials say they'll have to wait for the site to cool before they can survey the damage.  We'll bring you more on the explosion tomorrow.   On Wednesday, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee is holding a confirmation hearing for FERC nominees Pat Wood and Nora Mead Brownell.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says committee members expect the confirmation process to go smoothly.  If the confirmation goes through, the committee could vote on Wood and Brownell by next Wednesday.  The Washington bureau will bring you details on Wednesday.   Houston correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to discuss the Port of Houston and Port of Galveston merger.  The latest news is that Galveston Port officials are approving the project.  Kim says this is very big news in Houston since the bulk of Houston's imports/exports are oil and petrochemicals.  Kim will also discuss the Duke Energy decision to once and for all give up on Florida's utility business.  We'll bring you all the details on these and other stories from the Houston bureau on Wednesday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas says for the third week in a row the AGA's weekly report could show a build of more than 100 bcf in storage.  A Bloomberg survey of analysts and traders shows expectations ranging between a build of 100 bcf and 120 bcf.  We'll have the exact numbers for you on Wednesday.   There was a delay, but we are now set to bring you the interview with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles as promised.  Catch the Knowles interview in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.   On Thursday, ENL begins the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast early.  At 11:30 a.m. ET, we're scheduled to bring you live coverage of the unveiling of the Bush administration's national energy policy recommendations from St. Paul, Minnesota.  ENL's Peter Cook is scheduled to bring us live reports from St. Paul throughout the day.   As an added bonus on Thursday, former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker is scheduled to join us from ENL's D.C. bureau to analyze and provide insight on the Bush administration's energy policy.  Catch Hoecker and others during our special coverage of the announcement on Thursday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.   Keep it on energynewslive.com for all your energy news.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	   Dear Jason,  Rolling blackouts hit throughout California again, and Gov. Gray Davis continues to promote conservation.  Gov. Davis says he'll ""deputize"" janitors in Los Angeles, assigning them to turn off lights and office equipment in buildings they are cleaning.  This is just one of many moves coming from Gov. Davis as he continues to press for conservation and price caps until the power market in California stabilizes.   Just a little reminder: ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford will bring us reports from California tomorrow.  Jay is covering the meeting between Gov. Davis and 12 energy companies invited to Sacramento to discuss unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California.  Don't miss updates from Jay in California throughout the day tomorrow.     With Jay in California, ENL's Burke Moeller is giving me the lowdown from Capitol Hill.  Burke says the Washington bureau has plenty to follow tomorrow starting with reaction to the recommendations expected from the White House Energy Task Force. While the Task Force isn't expected to release its report until next week, some of its contents are already being leaked.  Environmental Media Services is holding a news conference tomorrow on the recommendations they expect will be in the report. The Washington team will also be following a House of Representatives hearing about the touchy issue of nuclear waste disposal.  We expect to hear plenty about the proposed nuclear waste facility in Yucca Mountain, Nevada.  ENL's Washington bureau will follow these and other stories tomorrow.   I spoke with ENL's Houston bureau correspondent Kim Benestante briefly this afternoon.  Kim says tomorrow she'll continue her conversation with the CEO and Founder of Cook Inlet Energy Supply, Gregory Craig.  He'll discuss the alliance between Cook Inlet and an Ivy League school.  Log on tomorrow to catch Kim's interview with Gregory Craig.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.       Keep it on energynewslive.com , for all your energy news.

1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile
handset industry. The segments top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

Its no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset shipments
were down by 10% over last year. Motorolas (MOT) sales fell by 22% in the quarter,
and Ericssons (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging to its bottom line
that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with Sony (SNE).

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Angelic missions rising
As VC funding slows, angel investors find new wings.

By Carla Drysdale

As the country struggles to its feet after the crash of the new economy,
exacerbated by the Sept. 11th attacks on the WTC, angel investors have
been doing their part to help by continuing to provide seed money to startups.

Angels, entrepreneurs-turned-investors, first earned this moniker during
depression-era New York by bailing out ailing Broadway theatre companies.
Since then, angel investments, along with those of venture capitalists, have
expanded from Broadway to the Internet and beyond. Now, because traditional
VCs are slowing the pace of investments, angels have new opportunities to
swoop down to fill in the seed-stage gap.

"CBS SPORTSLINE.COM FANTASY FOOTBALL NEWSLETTER","
[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the ""Gridiron Guru.""   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

OCTANE CAPITAL RUNS OUT OF GAS

In a recent letter to shareholders, Octane Capital Management announced that
it will stop making new investments and will return half of its estimated
$265 million in assets to investors.  The remaining capital will stay
invested.  Since mid to late 2000, the fund has reportedly had trouble
finding new suitable investments.  Rather than invest in companies it did
not find viable, the firm's managers have decided to return their excess
assets.

The firm was founded in March 2000 by a formidable team, seeking to
capitalize on the raging bull market.  The timing could not have been worse.
The firm's founding in March 2000 came at the beginning of the Internet
bubble's burst, and the market declines that came with it.  While the firm
was able to garner returns early on, its prospects became increasingly dim
as the floor fell out of the IPO market.

The firm started out looking to get into companies on the ground floor by
operating a ""cross-over"" style fund.  The fund invested in companies with a
public offering on the horizon.  Ideally, the firm would be able to identify
solid companies and benefit handsomely after an IPO pop.  The firm's
established staff helped lend an air of prestige to the firm itself.  Octane
Capital was originally founded with the help of Emeric McDonald and Alex
Monte-Santo (both formerly with Amerindo Investment Advisors, Inc.), David
Golob (formerly with Tiger Management L.L.C.), Tim Murphy (formerly with
Capital Research & Management), and George Lee and Laura Paradis (former
bankers with Goldman Sachs).

Unfortunately, the firm concentrated on companies with high revenues
regardless of earnings.  (In many cases, the kinds of companies that have
taken a beating in the market recently.)  The firm specifically invests in
emerging growth companies within the technology sector. Using a fundamental
approach, Octane seeks companies with high revenue growth, leadership
qualities and innovative products. Unlike other sectors, emerging growth
within the technology sector may include companies that have reached large
market caps.  The public equity portfolio typically consists of 20 to 40
core issues; some of which are private investments that have since gone
public.

In the year 2000, there was approximately $223 billion in U.S. common stock
underwriting, up from $175 billion in 1999 according to Thomson Financial
Securities Data.  However, much of last year's gain was a result of a high
volume of new issues introduced in the first quarter of 2000.  More
foreboding for firms such as Octane Capital- approximately 68% of IPOs were
trading below their issue price as of the beginning of 2001.

Many analysts believe that Octane Capital is one of the many firms that will
soon be winding down their operations and consolidating with other firms.
Venture capital and crossover funds flourished throughout 1999 and early
2000, offering tremendous returns as a result of a frantic and euphoric
stock market.  As the IPO market has suffered, so have the firms most
closely tied to it.

J.P. MORGAN CHASE & CO. MERGE TO CREATE INVESTMENT POWERHOUSE

Throughout the past few months, the buzz on the street was the recent merger
between Chase Manhattan Corp. and J.P. Morgan & Co., completed on December
31, 2000.  The merged firm operates under the name J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.
with various deviations for the subsidiaries.

A global competitor with operations in over 60 countries, stockholders
equity valued at more than $39 billion, assets in excess of $705 billion and
a market-cap of roughly $83 billion, the newly merged J.P. Morgan Chase &
Co. is an investment management powerhouse.  The firm activities encompass
investment banking, strategic advisory, equity and debt capital raising,
credit, global trading, market making activities, operating services, wealth
management, institutional asset management and private equity.

UNITED STATES



J.P. Morgan and Chase have complimented each other with various investment
styles ranging from growth to value.  For example, Houston-based J.P. Morgan
Fleming Asset Management- U.S. (formerly Chase Fleming Asset Management and
Chase Texas Investment Management Group), is a core growth investor
utilizing four equity strategies; equity income; America core; equity
growth; and small-cap.  Research is guided by proprietary valuations and
decisions are made based on company visits, discussions with customers and
competitors and industry analysts.  The firm's analysts then make
recommendations to the senior portfolio managers who ultimately make the
final decision.  On the other hand, New York-based J.P. Morgan Investment
Management, Inc., which employs an active equity strategy, is designed to
outperform the S&P 500 based on a bottom-up GARP philosophy.  Internal
fundamental research, systematic stock valuation and disciplined portfolio
construction enable the firm to build solid portfolios.  J.P. Morgan places
greater emphasis on normalized earnings and long-term growth rates and less
emphasis on near-term earnings.  The firm uses a proprietary DDM to derive
at a DDR (dividend discount rate).  The DDR serves a dual purpose, allowing
investment professionals to rank each potential investment and determine
performance for possible sell-outs.  Similar to the Houston office, a
majority of the research is conducted in-house, with decisions made on a
team basis between analysts and portfolio managers.  The combination of
Chase and J.P. Morgan has enabled the firm to offer a wider array of
investment philosophies.

As a result of the merger, structural changes have begun to take place and
will continue throughout the next few months.  The Houston office of Chase
Fleming Asset Management (formerly Chase Texas Investment Management Group)
has exchanged the Chase brand name for J.P. Morgan and now operates as J.P.
Morgan Fleming Asset Management.  The former New York office of Chase
Fleming, previously located on 320 Park Avenue, has merged with the team at
J.P. Morgan Investment Management, located at 522 Fifth Avenue.  Some of the
equity analysts that have relocated are: ROBERT ZECH, who follows small-cap
and private equity; CRAIG LEIGHTON, who follows micro-cap companies; GLENN
GAWRONSKI, who covers small-cap stocks; CLARE HART, who covers media
staples, transportation and media cyclicals; RICHARD ROYCE, who covers high
tech - hardware and software and cellular/wireless telecom; DAVID EDWARDS,
who covers small-cap and private equity, along with GARY SCHNIEROW, who
follows small-cap and micro-cap stocks.  The portfolio managers are as
follows:  T. GARY LIBERMAN, who follows high tech - hardware and software;
CHRISTOPHER JONES, who follows health care and consumer cyclicals; ANTHONY
GIFFORD, who covers consumer staples and communication services; TIMOTHY
PARTON, who covers transportation, business staples, business cyclicals,
non-bank financials, financials (diversified) and services (employment,
payroll process, facilities/environmental); EYTAN SHAPIRO, who covers
machinery, media staples and media cyclicals, MICHEAL FOSS, who covers food
& beverages, and computer services; along with JONATHAN SIMON who covers
real estate, non-bank financials, financial (diversified), insurance
(life/health, property-casualty and multi-line).

As a result of the merger between J.P. Morgan & Chase, the December 31, 2000
filing is a combination of approximately 32 institutions. J.P. Morgan
Investment Management, Morgan Guaranty, Chase Fleming, and Chase Asset
Management (now J.P. Morgan Private Bank) are among the entities now
included in this filing.

UNITED KINGDOM

Numerous changes have occurred at the London offices J.P. Morgan Fleming
Asset Management U.K. Ltd. as well.  The firm also dropped the use of the
Chase brand name, as both the J.P. Morgan and Fleming brand names carried
the most cache in much of the U.K.  Following the merger of Chase and
Fleming, Chase Fleming moved to a new office at 10 Aldermanbury from its old
Copthall Avenue location in September 2000.  While the merger between J.P.
Morgan and Chase was completed at the beginning of the year, the firms did
not combine physically until late April 2001.  Following the merger with
J.P. Morgan, the former Chase Fleming made yet another move to Finsbury
Dials, its current location.  The combined firm, J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset
Mgmt. U.K. Ltd., started operating out of its new offices on April 30, 2001.
The former J.P. Morgan entity also changed its location, moving from King
St. to join its sister staff at Finsbury Dials.  However, the combined
location has not led to a combined investment staff and investment approach.

Despite their common location and common name (J.P. Morgan Fleming Asset
Mgmt. U.K. Ltd.), the former Chase Fleming and J.P. Morgan entities continue
to operate as separate entities.  MARTIN PORTER has remained as the chief
investment officer at the former Fleming entity, while PABLO FORERO remains
chief investment officer of the former J.P. Morgan entity.  The reasons for
the separation lie in the firm's divergent client base.  Each institution
had too many large institutional clients that both sides feared an exodus of
clients if a particular service or investment approach were changed too
much.

Already, former Fleming and Chase brand names are being purged from the
firm's mutual fund line-up.  After first adding Chase to many of its funds,
the name will no longer be used along with former Fleming brand Save &
Prosper.  The former J.P. Morgan does not run any U.K. retail funds at the
moment, but may plan too, perhaps borrowing Fleming's distribution and
style.

The former J.P. Morgan entity uses an investment approach similar to its
stateside relative, using the proprietary DDM model.  The DDM is used to
calculate each company's dividend discount rate; companies are subsequently
ranked based on their DDR.  The managers attempt to exploit inefficiencies
in the market and purchase companies that are selling at a discount to their
intrinsic value.  In identifying such investments, portfolio managers
utilize fundamental analysis coupled with an emphasis on relative
valuations.  Investments are concentrated in the securities of companies
with the highest ranking within their respective sectors.

The former Fleming entity uses a larger, macro-economic analysis in stock
selection.  The firm assesses economic themes and attempts to construct a
portfolio of attractive growth stocks.  All overseas investments are subject
to BARRA risk analysis.  The firm's model portfolios, decided on by a
committee, are mandatory for all managers of discretionary balanced
portfolios.  Individual fund managers have no discretion over market timing
or asset allocation adjustments.  The former Flemings entity had endured
some unfortunate investment returns as a result of its growth-oriented
style. The merger with J.P. Morgan was widely hoped to help stem redemptions
by large pension funds and institutions.

1. Picks and pans: Telecom favorites and has-beens
Charles Payne rates 17 telecom stocks that sank like hot air balloons for their
ability to regain altitude or not.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all
the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the
bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they
were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when
the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air
balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing).
Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with
the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering
altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will
indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than
advertised.

2. Upwards revisions: Better and better
Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual
opportunities.

By Dave Sterman

Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand,
sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices
on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare
chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices.

With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector
that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly
inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the
accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in
relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7.

And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation,
we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three ""strong buy"" ratings,
and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.

3. Upside potential: Unusual support looms for tower stocks
Debt burdens and zoning laws may seem like unlikely benefits, but there you
have it.

By Dave Sterman

Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators
are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks.
Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong,
and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have
characterized the rest of the telecom industry.

That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong
stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping
levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating
landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable
the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of
the pie.

4. International wires: From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining
analyst esteem.

BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst
esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating,
but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better
than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (""buy"").
What gives?

5. Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile
handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset
shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22%
in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging
to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with
Sony (SNE).

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  The country this week is waiting for the unveiling of Vice President Cheney's energy task force recommendations.  Washington bureau's Peter Cook is preparing to fly to St. Paul, Minnesota to cover the event on Thursday.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford says the public relations planning has already begun.  Several press briefings are being scheduled along with congressional hearings in the House and Senate in the hopes of drumming up support for the recommendations.  Jay says he thinks Congress will try to approve a national energy policy bill before the August recess.  We'll bring you live coverage from St. Paul on Thursday.   In Houston, correspondent Kim Benestante tells us Valero Energy plans to continue its  expansion.  Valero is waiting for FTC approval on its acquisition of Ultramar Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion last week.  If the deal is finally approved, Valero will still have $1 billion for maintenance and upgrades, and $1 billion in cash flow.  Kim says the money may be used to build new refinery sites in North Dakota and Utah.  Catch all the details tomorrow from the Houston bureau.     Kim says the Houston bureau is also scheduled to bring us a segment from Dr. Barton Smith, a professor and the Director of Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston.  He's set to discuss the homogenizing of U.S. gasoline grades.  Dr. Smith brings us all the details tomorrow.     ENL will also continue our coverage from Anchorage, Alaska tomorrow. Gale Smith is set to bring us more live reports from the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission's Midyear Meeting.  Tomorrow Gale brings us a one-on-one interview with Alaska Governor Tony Knowles.  We'll also have reaction to the Bush administration's national energy policy.  Log on to see the Tony Knowles interview and more from Anchorage and the IOGCC.    Also tomorrow, Paul Weissgarber, the Vice President of Process Industries for A.T. Kearney, Inc., is scheduled to join us from Houston.  He'll discuss procurement in energy companies.  Be sure to catch Weissgarber in the 4:00 p.m. ET broadcast.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  It was an action-packed day as President Bush outlined his recommendations for the nation's energy policy, and ENL had special coverage of President Bush's speech.  Washington correspondent Peter Cook hustled around St. Paul, bringing us live reports throughout the day.  During our special edition of ENL we received analysis and reaction from former FERC Chairman Dr. James J. Hoecker, Executive Editor of FT Energy David Wagman, and President of CERA Joseph Stanislaw.  If you missed the special 11:30 a.m. ET newscast, log onto ENL's Video Library to catch it in its entirety.         On Friday from our D.C. bureau, we're continuing coverage of the Bush administration's national energy policy.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports the bureau will continue to get reactions on Friday from Washington lawmakers on the task force's recommendations.  Jay also reports we'll be following President Bush as he wraps up his energy tour by visiting the Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation in Pennsylvania.      Also from Washington, we're scheduled to speak with Gay Friedmann, the Vice President for Legislative Affairs for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America.  She'll help us break down the White House Energy Task Force Report in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Houston correspondent Kim Benestante reports that a group of major industrial companies including ExxonMobil, Reliant and Shell are asking a judge to block the state's smog plan for Houston.  We'll have more details for you on Friday.    Also on Friday, the Houston bureau is scheduled to have Merrill Lynch Vice President of Natural Gas Carl Kirst in studio.  Kirst will discuss the national energy policy's effect on Texas in the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Log on to see Kirst from Houston on Friday.

"WOW...... FANTASTIC BUSINESS OPP........ -supdfq","Hello
Over the last 4 years I have built my retirement income stream in a Network Marketing Company that has eclipsed every measurable growth category in the history of the industry. We have grown faster than Microsoft, IBM and Coca Cola did in their first 3 years. Although we do no advertising and you most likely have never heard of us we currently are operating at THIRTY-TWO  MILLION DOLLARS per MONTH in 22 countries !!

This phenomenal growth has been fueled by a product that my company has the exclusive world-wide distribution rights to and enjoys a 83% reorder order rate with the consumer base.

I am looking to pass the baton to the right person or persons.
I can and will offer the following:

a.  An inexhaustible world wide lead source?at no expense to you
b. A tested and proven duplicable training system, created and ran by me..for you
c. 21 years of experience in this industry which we will compound into your success

I am not looking for an investor, I am looking for a working partner or partners.

Only the seasoned NETWORKER or experienced business entrepreneur with the right aptitude and attitude for success starting today need reply.

For further details please call: 800-266-7240 ext. 0004

His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Updated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dallas ! fa! ces Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Bert Emanuel  , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 t! im! es for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, ! wh! o always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Terrell caught one! p! ass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Marty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jackson! vi! lle. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owner! s ! this season.   Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week.

Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) with the state prior to conducting the ceremony.

FUNERALS
A very hard time for you and your family
Don't settle for a minister you don't know!!
Most states require that you register your certificate (THAT WE SEND YOU) with the state prior to conducting the ceremony.

BAPTISMS
You can say ""WELCOME TO THE WORLD!!!! I AM YOUR MINISTER AND YOUR UNCLE!!""
What a special way to welcome a child of God.

FORGIVENESS OF SINS
The Catholic Church has practiced the forgiveness of sins for centuries
**Forgiveness of Sins is granted to all who ask in sincerity and willingness to change for the better!!

Considering the value of becoming a CERTIFIED MINISTER I'd say the program is easily worth $100.  Wouldn't you agree?  However, it won't cost that much.  Not even close!  My goal is to make this life changing program affordable so average folks can benefit from the power of it.

Since I know how much you want to help others, you're going to receive your Minister Certification for under $100.00... Not even $50.00...  You are going to receive the entire life-changing course for only $29.95.

Willy - 

I having an electrician come out to install a new thermostat at your house.  He can do it sometime today or tomorrow.  

I gave the electrician your work and home phone numbers so he will be calling you to see when he can go out.

We think the thermostat you got is a lemon.  We are just going to have a new one installed and see if it solves your problems.

NETSOL INTERNATIONAL, INC.
(NASDAQ: NTWK)

NETSOL SHAREHOLDERS GROUP, LLC INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO GAIN CONTROL OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF NETSOL INTERNATIONAL, INC.

(NASDAQ: <a href=""http://quotes.nasdaq.com/Quote.dll?mode=stock&page=multi&symbol=NTWK%60&selected=NTWK"">NTWK</a>)

600,000 Share Declared Short Position Target Of Potential Short Squeeze

Previous Close: $ 4.40*
52 week high/low $49/$0.62*
Total Shares Outstanding: 11.7M*
Earnings Per Share (EPS): $-0.53 (Latest Four Quarters)*
Market Cap: $53,145,320*
Beta: 0.95 (S&P 500 used in calculation of Beta)*
* as of 05.22.01

Hey Folks, this company must be in play. Here's a stock that went from $75 to .75 in one year. But see here, this stock has

clearly been under accumulation since the middle of March and has rebound from .75 to $4.75.

Who's accumulating this stock and why?

(CLUE)

A group of shareholders, NetSol Shareholders Group, LLC, has filed a <a

href=""http://realtimefilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2001/05/17/0001095811-01-502379.html"">preliminary proxy
statement</a> and <a href=""http://realtimefilings.nasdaq.com/edgar_conv_html/2001/05/17/0001095811-01-502375.html"">Schedule

13D</a> amendment with the Securities and Exchange Commission describing an intended course of action to gain control of the

company from current management. In both their original proxy statement filed April 24 and an amended statement filed May 17,

the Group states that they feel the investment community lacks confidence in the Company and its management and that they

believe there is huge loss of opportunity under current management causing the Company to lose its credibility within the

investment community. This group of shareholders is not satisfied with the existing management or Board of the Company. The

Group believes that the Company has not maximized the value of its most significant assets and has not adequately pursued

market opportunities.

In a recent press release (Dow Jones Business News 05/03/01), the management team of NetSol International, Inc. (NTWK)

replied, saying that its board of directors intends to vigorously resist the shareholders proposal to elect new directors,

stating, ""Those candidates on the proposed slate do not have the skills required to execute the NetSol business plan."" If

this is true, why is Cary Burch, the CIO of The First American Corporation (NYSE: <a

href=""http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?page=multi&mode=stock&symbol=&symbol=FAF&symbol"">FAFM</a>) and a current director of

NetSol International, Inc., listed on the proposed new board? You have to ask yourself, why would Mr. Burch, with over

eighteen years of leadership, business management and information technology experience, associate himself with this group if

he did not believe it is in the best interest of all of the Stockholders to elect a slate of new Directors?In that same press

release, NetSol International stated that ""the four shareholders seeking to replace the board are led by Blue Water Master

Fund, a Netherlands, Antilles-based hedge fund, and are believed to hold about 25% of NetSol's outstanding common stock.""

NetSol reported about 11.3 million outstanding shares as of Feb. 26. If the Group did not believe they have a majority, why

would they continue to pursue this issue with such intensity? One would have to believe that substantially more shares are

prepared to vote to give the Shareholders Group control than current management would want you to believe.

THIS COMPANY IS DEFINITELY IN PLAY FOLKS!

It has come to our attention that NetSol Shareholders Group, LLC has begun to intensify their efforts to implement their

proposed new slate of directors.

The <a href=""http://www.otcjournal.com/"">OTC Journal</a>, an electronic publication which has been following NetSol

International
since January of 1999, had some astute observations about current events in this past weekend's edition. To review this

publication simply click here.

http://listserv.otcjournal.com/register2/

Look for the shareholders group to engage an investment bank and pursue acquiring, merging with or being acquired by another

public company. According to a <a

href=""http://mktnews.nasdaq.com/newsv2/pullstory_nasd.asp?textpath=//News2/news_www/Nasdaq/news/35/2001/05/07/200105071242DOW

JONESDJONLINE000411.html&usymbol=NTWK"">May 7 Business News release</a>, two of the group's nominees, Shelly Singhal, Managing

Director of Technology Investment Banking for BlueStone Capital Corp. and Donald Danks, CEO of Netgateway, Inc. (OTC BB:

NGWY), are directors of NetGateway Inc. (<a

href=""http://quotes.nasdaq.com/quote.dll?page=&mode=stock&symbol=NGWY&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=&symbol=

&symbol=&symbol=&multi.x=13&multi.y=15"">NGWY</a>). According to NetSol, NetGateway is the company which the group may intend

to combine with NetSol, meaning Danks and Singhal would ""sit on both sides of the negotiating table."" Singhal told Dow Jones

Newswires that NetGateway would be interested in pursuing a strategic relationship with NetSol if the alternatives would work
from a business standpoint.

In March 2000, NetSol International Inc. (NTWK) was trading as high as $75 before dropping to less than $1 by March 2001. The

Company is currently trading at or just under $5. In the past two years, current management has been unable to break even,

let alone show a profit. The most recent 10-Q was dismal. <a

href=""http://smallcapcenter.com/snapshot_techanalysis.asp?component=compinfo.asp&row=2&page=snap_techanalysis.asp&flag=true&t

icker=NTWK"">Smallcapcenter.com's</a> advanced research department <a

href=""http://smallcapcenter.com/snapshot_techanalysis.asp?component=compinfo.asp&row=2&page=snap_techanalysis.asp&flag=true&t

icker=NTWK"">Stockscore</a> has risen from 36 on April 27, 2001 to 70 on May 22, 2001.

In addition to Cary Burch, the Group lists Jonathan D. Iseson, principal of Blue Water Partners, L.L.C., Gregory J. Martin,

former Vice President of Emerge Corporation, Peter R. Sollenne, President and CEO of Techna Global Solutions, Inc., Timothy

J. Moynagh, Senior Business Solutions Manager of Inktomi Corporation, and Eddy Verresen, founder of BSH-Belgische

Struisvogelhouderij as those chosen to act on the proposed new Board of Directors. New management intends to immediately

engage an investment bank and actively pursue acquiring, merging with or being acquired by another public company. The Group

is soliciting the proxies of Stockholders to remove the current Directors of the Company and elect the Nominees as new

Directors of the Company immediately by written consent, or if necessary at a Special Meeting on Friday, June 1, 2001.

BE SURE TO READ THE DEFINITIVE PROXY STATEMENT OF THE SHAREHOLDERS GROUP WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE, IT CONTAINS IMPORTANT

INFORMATION. You can get the proxy statement, and any other relevant documents, for free at the Securities and Exchange

Commission's web site at http://www.sec.gov. The definitive proxy statements will also be available free from the Group and

the Company.You can obtain the identity of the participants in the solicitation and a description of their direct and

"Collect Judicial Judgements          556567","  Thank  you  for  your  interest!!                          
Judgment Courses offers an extensive training
course in  ""How to Collect Money Judgments""   .          _  s15*
  
If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a
Money Judgment is and  why processing Money Judgments
can earn you very substantial income   .
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you
will have a Money Judgment against them.
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the
shocking fact: ""Its now up to you to collect on the
Judgment"". The court does not require the loser to pay you.
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do
when they are found. The result is that millions of
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.
""In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a
dime.""
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic
proportions. Right now in the United States there is
between  200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money
Judgment debt   . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more
Judgments take its place.
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the
techniques necessary to succeed.
With our first hand experience we have built a course which
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.
By following the steps laid out in our course and with
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the
processing of Money Judgments.
The income potential is substantial in this profession.  We
have associates who have taken our course and are now
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00
and $100,000.00 per year  . Some choose to operate out of
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business
offices.
Today our company and our associates have over 126
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us
for reports.
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the
payment of the principal.
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.
  92% of all of our associates work out of their home; 43%
are women and 36% are part time   .
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments
are still in force, they do not disappear.
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you
are. You are not a collection agency.
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing
are as follows:
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who
to write to)
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them
unless you want to.
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other
companies charge $25.00.
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the
course)
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to
the original Judgment holder.
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)
Quote's from several of our students:
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: ""I just wanted to drop
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course.  My
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars   . Your
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of
judgments he is working on.
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in
area code 314 stated to us: ""  I am now making $2,000.00 per
week  and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in
judgments I am collecting on now.""
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated
""  I am now making $12,000.00   per month and have approximately
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I
will have to hire someone to help out""
Marshal in area code 407 states to us ""I feel bad, you only
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having
your course for 5 months""
From the above information and actual results you can see
why we can state the following:
With our course you can own your own successful business.
A business which earns you substantial income now and one
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to
retire on and travel the world. A business which is
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every
day is new and exciting.
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen
for many others already. Make it happen for you!
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation
on your part.
  Please call us at  1--4 0 6 --6 5 2 --0 1 9 4  ..
We have Service Support   staff available to you from 8:00am to
9:00pm (Mountain Time) 7 days a week   . If you call this number
you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel.
They can answer any questions you may have - with no obligation.
Sometimes we run special pricing on our courses and combinations
of courses. When you call our Customer Support line they can let
you know of any specials we may be running. If you like what you
read and hear about our courses, then the Customer Support person
can work with you to place your order. We are very low key. We
merely give you the facts and you can then decide if you want to
work with us or not.
Thank you for your time and interest.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts today while he's on vacation this week.     From Washington on Thursday, the Senate Energy Committee continued its policy to refrain from holding any committee hearings until a reorganization plan is agreed upon.  We'll keep you updated on further developments when the Senate Energy Committee reconvenes.   The House is out of session on Friday, so we'll get reaction to the events that took place this week and discuss what may be on the horizon for the energy debate in the coming weeks.  Also on Friday, we're scheduled to speak with Gas Daily Assistant Editor Nathan Hodge from our DC bureau.  Hodge will discuss the FERC and El Paso trial and a call to holding hearings on the FERC.  Catch Hodge in the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to bring us an update on the agreement between Houston-based Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and the Calpine Corporation on Friday.  The companies are building a pipeline that will run from New Mexico to the San Francisco area.   Also from Houston, we'll have details on Trico Marine Services' acquisition of two  state-of-the-art supply vessels from a Norwegian company.  The ships use a ""dynamic positioning"" system while exploring in deep waters.  We'll have these stories and more from the Houston bureau on Friday.   From the AMEX in New York on Friday, Environmental Brokerage Group's Managing Director of Emissions Trading Michael Intrator is scheduled to join us.  A panel of top American scientists says global warming is a real problem, and it's getting worse.  Intrator will give us his insight on this statement in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Just a reminder:  On Monday, ENL brings you live reports from our new West Coast bureau.  ENL Correspondent Kym McNicholas is preparing for a summer full of energy news from Sacramento.  Log on Monday to catch the first of many reports from ENL's West Coast bureau.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.   Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hollowman Updated 11/25/01 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk ! be! cause of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now. ! Ron Dayne , RB NYG - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - The Flounders Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake Plummer , QB ARI - Free Agent! ! Updated 11/25/01 Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David Boston , WR ARI - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/25/01 Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - Little Bambinos Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB OAK - Hatcher's Right Nut Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain Smith , RB NE - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/! 25! /01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Hollowman Updated 11/25/01 Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - AARP Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Hollowman Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too incon! si! stent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - The Internet Potatoes Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Threesome Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed Su! nd! ay's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - Cocked and Locked Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chandler , QB ATL - The Great Bald Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  It's official: Sen. Jim Jeffords is leaving the Republican Party and declares himself an Independent.  This move is going to have repercussions touching aspects in every area of legislation, and will undoubtedly affect the national energy policy.  We'll continue to update you on this situation from our Washington bureau.     Republicans and Democrats are nearing an agreement on the Electricity Emergency Relief Act.  Compromise language is being discussed behind closed doors, and members hope to resolve their differences when the markup continues Friday morning.   In a continuing effort to promote the Bush administration's energy plan, the Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham is scheduled to travel to a nuclear power plant in Maryland on Friday.  Correspondent Peter Cook is scheduled to be along for the ride.  Tuesday, Peter brings us details of his trip to Maryland.    Also on Friday, I'm scheduled to speak with U.S. Chamber of Commerce Vice President of Energy Policy William Kovacs. He'll join us from Washington, D.C. to preview an energy meeting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce where Vice President Dick Cheney will talk about the White House energy plan.  Catch my interview with Kovacs in the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.     ENL's Gale Smith reports the Houston bureau is scheduled to give us an update from the ongoing story of 70,000 royalty owners who are filing a class action lawsuit against ExxonMobil.  The royalty owners allege Exxon unfairly determined the royalties they should receive from natural gas and natural gas liquids sales.  On Wednesday, a San Antonio U.S. District Judge certified the lawsuit filed by a Houston law firm.  Gale says the Houston bureau will bring you reactions from Exxon officials on Friday.     Dorothea El Mallakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development is also scheduled to join us from our Houston bureau.  She says conservation is not synonymous with deprivation, and the current energy issue is not a problem with a quick solution.  We'll bring you more from Mallakh in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast on Friday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"Get Ready for a Texas Showdown!","Dear jason,




ROCKETS TO DO BATTLE WITH THE MAVS SATURDAY

After trailing the Lakers by 15 points in the third quarter of last night's game, the Rockets needed a lift. They turned to the sold-out Compaq Center crowd and got what they were looking for.

With the house-a-rockin', Steve, Cuttino and the gang led a furious second-half Rockets rally spurred by the energy of the sold-out arena. Although the comeback fell just short, the fans' support was a certain factor in the rally.

The Rockets will be looking for the same support Saturday when Michael Finley, Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks pay a visit to Compaq Center for a Texas Showdown. Game time is 7:30 p.m.

Tickets are going fast, so get yours today by calling 1-800-4NBA-TIX, visiting any Ticketmaster outlets or the Compaq Center box office, or ordering online at rockets.com (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=133970&UID=45454538&MID=188026).

See you at Compaq Center!

      <p>Dear Jennifer,</p> 
<!-- Copy in each day's wrap up specifics after this point. --> 
<p>Two large mergers are done deals.  Valero Energy is buying rival Ultramar 
Diamond Shamrock for $4 billion in cash and the assumption of $2 billion in 
debt today.  The acquisition creates the second-largest refiner of petroleum 
products in the U.S. Williams Energy, parent company of ENL, also completed 
a $2.8 billion deal to buy Denver-based Barrett Resources.  The deal more 
than doubles Williams' natural gas reserves, and now makes Williams a 
producer and distributor of natural gas.  Today ENL brought you interviews 
with the CEOs from all four companies.  If you happened to miss it, log onto 
the ENL website and click on ""video library"" to see the interviews in full. 
<p>ENL's Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford leaves for California early 
tomorrow.  Jay is scheduled to cover the meeting between California Gov. 
Gray Davis and 12 energy companies.  The agenda of the meeting will include 
discussion of unpaid debts, credit and the supply of power in California. 
Log on for updates from California with ENL's Jay Cranford. 
<p>Tomorrow, the Houston bureau will report on the Rig Insight Company.  Kim 
Benestante tells us this company offers a web-based platform where other 
companies can access rig data such as day-rates and availability.  Be sure 
to catch this report from Houston tomorrow.  Later in the week, Kim will 
take a trip to Texas Southern University for an interview with Dr. Joshua 
Hill to talk about the University's solar technology department.  Kim says 
TSU has the largest solar lab facility in the South, and produces solar 
panels for use all over the world.  Log on Friday when ENL sheds some light 
on the solar panel issue. 
<p>Coming up tomorrow, Cook Inlet's Gregory Craig is scheduled to join us 
from our Houston bureau.  Craig will be in to discuss Cook Inlet's joint 
venture with Mirant.  We'll bring you all the details in the 10:00 a.m. EST 
broadcast. 
<p>This is a dynamic industry and things are subject to change at a moment's 
notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to 
do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 
<p>Keep it on <a href=""http://www.energynewslive.com/ "">energynewslive.com</a> for all your energy news.

On Tuesday, Kim talks with Reliant Energy about steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.   Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John MacDonald talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has for Gas-to-Liquids production.  This type of motor fuel is odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.   From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, ESAI Power and Gas Services Director Edward Kraples will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast, he'll talk about the amount of investment needed to keep Northwest power prices from escalating.

 	 	    Dear Jason,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.     On Wednesday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us live reports from the final day of the 115th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria.  As promised, Wolfgang delivered an exclusive live interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez in the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast.  Secretary General Rodriguez discussed OPEC production, exports, and the upcoming July 3rd OPEC meeting during the interview.  If you happened to miss Secretary General Rodriguez, click on ENL's Video Library to catch the interview in full.   We've been following the Electricity Emergency Relief Act markup from Washington for quite some time now, and on Wednesday the bill was suddenly tabled.  House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin says the measure lacked the bipartisan support necessary to continue the legislative process.     In Washington on Thursday we're going to continue to follow the change of power in the Senate.  We'll pay particular attention to the restructuring of the Senate Energy Committee.  We'll also have more on efforts to sell the President's energy plan to Congress.   The Houston bureau's Gale Smith reports on Thursday they'll continue to cover the trip of the Cote d'Ivoire Minister of Mines and Energy Emmanuel Leon Monnet to Houston.  He's meeting with Houston-based companies and officials about increasing oil and gas production along the Ivory Coast.     Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Omega Oil Company Executive Vice President of Operations Andy Ashby is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss a reservoir production method for drilling and how this new technique is more cost efficient.  Log on Thursday for these stories and more from the Houston bureau.   ENL is going to California.  Next week we'll bring you reports from our brand new West Coast bureau based in Sacramento.  ENL Correspondent Kym McNicholas is headed to California for the summer to cover developments along the West Coast.  We're scheduled to bring you daily reports and live coverage from our West Coast bureau starting Monday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.

"Making Sexuall Attraction Available To Everybody !!","<HTML><PRE><BODY BGCOLOR=""#000000""><FONT COLOR=""#00FFFF"" SIZE=3>
NOW AVAILABLE IN THE U.S.....A HUMAN PHEROMONE
SCENT THAT REALLY WORKS!

""NATURE'S ONLY TRUE APHRODISIAC?""

SCIENCE has finally done it!  The human pheromone
that attracts men or women has at last been
synthesized in the laboratory!  Naturally found in
minute amounts in the prespiration of men and women,
this so-called ""natural aphrodisiac"" was, until recently,
little more than an evolutionary remnant from a time
when humans relied on scent to attract the opposite
sex.

SCIENTISTS have proven that human pheromones can
trigger POWERFUL sexual responses in men and women.
Unfortunately, evolution has robbed men/women of
the ability to naturally produce sufficient quantities of
these pheromones to have a discernable effect on
the opposite sex !!

THIS amazing product is sold in stores for $99.95 a
bottle.  Our price is less... MUCH LESS!  This is
the strongest concentration of human pheromones,
allowed by LAW, in an essential oil base that
smells great!

WHEN
 you use Androstenone Pheromone Concentrate,
even in small amounts, you will see why men and women
everywhere are reporting ASTOUNDING results!  Armed
with the power of pheromones, you will soon experience
the joy of having men/women aproach you, making eye
contact, smiling and even initiating conversations!  EVEN
MEN/WOMEN YOU HARDLY KNOW !

THE announcement of this scientific breakthrough, set
off a media FIRE-STORM.  Androstenone Pheromones
have been featured in every major publication,
newspaper, national magazine, and television
magazine.  From 20/20, Hard Copy, and Dateline
NBC to the  N. Y. Times, and the American Journal
of Modern Medicine.

IN CREATING Androstenone Pheromone Concentrate,
pure human pheromones are blended with essential
oils that produce a scent so seductive that it is almost
unfair to the opposite sex! The incredible power of
pheromones, in other animals, can be observed by
the way a dog in SEASON can drive other dogs
crazy with sexual desire from miles away!

SEE WHAT THIS  SATISFIED CUSTOMER HAS
TO SAY:

HI ALLEN...
JUST wanted to let you know I received the pheromones
the day before yesterday...I tried it out for the first time,
last evening, with AMAZING results!  There was a
noticeable difference in the attention I received, and
would like to order more as soon as I can!  Thanks
from a very satisfied customer!!!
Sincerely,
Les Wilmer

 	 	    Dear Jason,  International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale is on his way to the 115th OPEC Conference Tuesday and Wednesday, and is scheduled to speak with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  We'll bring you Wolfgang's exclusive interview with Rodriguez later next week.  Wolfgang also tells us he may have an interview with Senior Energy Analyst at the Center for Global Energy Studies Julian Lee.  Log on all next week for updates from Wolfgang's trip.   The House and Senate are back in session next week, and Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford expects a chaotic week of reorganization ahead.  The power shift in the Senate is the big news on Capitol Hill, and Jay anticipates official movement to begin by Tuesday.  The Washington bureau will follow the changes taking place in leadership and the key energy chairmanships.     Jay also says Interior Secretary Gale Norton is scheduled to testify before the House Resources Committee.  She's expected to defend the administration's national energy policy.  Additionally next week, the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee will conduct a hearing on conservation and energy efficiency.  We'll follow these stories and more from the Washington bureau next week.     Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports the current boom in the energy industry is creating a need for qualified employees.  Next week Kim is scheduled to take a look at companies implementing training programs for high school and college students that groom them for positions within the industry.     Also from Houston, ENL's Gale Smith brings us a report on minority-owned energy-related businesses.  Gale is scheduled to speak with a Houston businessman who turned his company into a multi-million dollar operation that employs mostly minorities.  The Houston bureau will bring us details next week.   We're also scheduled to talk with Vice President of Omega Oil Company Andy Ashby from Houston next week.  Ashby knows the ins and outs of production methods, and will discuss below the reservoir production, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We're scheduled to speak with Ashby on Tuesday.    I'm leaving for vacation on Friday, and ENL's Stephanie Stanton and Washington Correspondent Peter Cook are sharing anchoring duties next week.  I'm also passing the pen to Peter.  He'll bring you the nightly e-mail wrap while I'm away.      Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.      Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

ROCKETS 5-GAME OUTLOOK

The Rockets kick off a four-game West Coast road trip tonight in Sacramento. Other stops include Portland (Tuesday), Seattle (Friday) and L.A. to take on the Clippers (Sunday). Houston will then return home Tuesday, November 27 to host the Kings.

Or details about the next five games, check out the Rockets 5-Game Outlook (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134695&UID=45454538&MID=188637).



ROCKETS ACTIVATE DAN LANGHI

The Houston Rockets have placed guard Tierre Brown on the injured list with plantar fasciitis of the left foot, General Manager Carroll Dawson has announced. In a related move, the Rockets activated forward Dan Langhi from the injured list.

Brown has seen action in one regular season game, recording two points and three assists while making his NBA debut at Denver on Nov. 9. The 6-foot-2, 189-pound rookie averaged 4.0 points and 2.3 assists for Houston in four preseason games. The McNeese State product received All-Southland Conference honors following each of the last two college basketball seasons.

Langhi has been sidelined for Houston's first nine games with a right ankle sprain. The 6-foot-11, 22-0 pound forward averaged 5.8 points and 1.8 rebounds in five Rockets preseason games. Langhi averaged 2.7 points and 1.2 rebounds as a rookie last year after being named the 2000 Southeastern Conference Player of the Year with Vanderbilt the previous season.

MO' BETTA BUNCH

Houston Rockets forward Maurice Taylor (http://www.nbateamnews.com/i.cfm?DID=134697&UID=45454538&MID=188637) has purchased 40 regular season tickets and will donate all of the seats to local non-profit community groups that serve underprivileged children. Taylor plans to make the Rockets home game seats available to the community groups throughout the remainder of the 2001-2002 NBA season. Appropriately dubbed the ""Mo'Betta Bunch,"" Taylor's charitable endeavor will touch the lives of
more than 1,400 children in the Houston area.

Each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group attending a Rockets home game will receive reserved seating in Compaq Center, designated with a special, brightly colored banner, and an exclusive, red T-shirt sporting Taylor's name and Rockets jersey number. Schedule permitting, Taylor intends to personally welcome each ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" group to the game prior to tipoff.

""I am very pleased to have the opportunity to help our deserving youth and provide a Rockets game experience,"" said Taylor. ""Having the ability to touch so many young lives and make a positive impact is truly rewarding.""

The Rockets Community Services Department will be responsible for selection of groups to participate in ""Mo' Betta Bunch"" and the distribution of tickets and T-shirts.

The goal of Taylor's ticket donation program is to help non-profit groups who are already making a difference in the lives of children, but who lack the finances to provide extra-curricular activities.



INSIDE THE ROCKETS

Inside the Rockets is your chance to get up close and personal with Rockets players throughout the season. Each Monday we will ask a different question and the players' responses to that question will be posted. Be sure to check back each week to see their answers to an all-new question!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------


1. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Beware the ghosts of Christmas 2001
Spirits are hanging over the markets, not all of
which promise happy returns.

By Rick Wayman, CFA

The market will face some difficult challenges during the next two
quarters, and investors need to be aware of these issues in order to
invest wisely. So, in the spirit of the coming season, and with
apologies to Charles Dickens, I would like to introduce you to
these challenges as the ghosts of Christmas--Version 2001.

Our main theme is that the economy is not as good as the market
currently thinks it is, and that earnings will come under increased
pressure by issues that have not yet appeared on the Streets radar.
The combination of these forces could depress stocks near-term,
but could also result in a classic January rally.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Value without tears
Those who follow our value-oriented screens know that
value investors don't just wind up buying dogs.

By Marc Gerstein

All investors risk getting involved with dogs every day. But value
investors need to be especially sensitive to the matter, since they
make a regular practice of searching for stocks that look attractive
based on some simple arithmetic that any investor can do, and on
answers that anyone can see. If you're searching for value, you
almost have to presume that anything you uncover is a dog until
you receive specific evidence showing otherwise.

and brand identity.  The firm now operates as KBSH Capital Management Inc.

the marketplace, helping to produce a stronger firm with more resources, and
further enhancing investment returns and providing a greater choice of
value-added products for its clients.""

----------------------------------------------------------

JOHN JARES RETURNS TO FOUNDERS

On November 13, 2001, the Dreyfus Founders Funds submitted several mutual
fund filings with the SEC.  While this is a common occurrence, what was not
so common was the statement at the bottom that read, ""Thomas M. Arrington
and Scott A. Chapman...are no longer associated with Founders.""

This departure could have been quite a blow to Founders; however, to soften
the impact the firm announced that it would be welcoming back a familiar
friend. Now that Arrington and Chapman are moving on, the multitude of funds
that they managed are being handed off to JOHN JARES.   Jares joins the firm
from Delaware Investment Advisors where he served as a portfolio manager for
several of Delaware's funds including the Delaware Balanced Fund.  On his
return to Founders, Jares is receiving quite a warm reception and vote of
confidence as he is handed management responsibility for the Dreyfus
Founders Focus, Dreyfus Founders Growth Fund (with $1.1 billion in equity
assets as of 6/30/2001), the Dreyfus Founders Growth and Income Funds (with
$308.0 million in equity assets as of 6/30/2001), and the domestic portion
of Worldwide Growth Fund (with $154.4 million in equity assets as of
6/30/2001). But then again, Jares and Founders are hardly strangers; from
1994 to 1997, Jares was employed as a portfolio manager at Founders.

The next move for Chapman and Arrington is not known at this time, however
history has shown that the two are likely to stick together for a long time
to come.  Back in December 1998, the duo joined Founders from Highmark
Capital Management, where Arrington served as vice president and director of
income equity strategy and portfolio manager of the Highmark Income Equity
Fund, while Chapman served as vice president and director of Highmark's
growth strategy and managed the Highmark Growth Fund.

-----------------------------------------------------------

BRUCE WASSERSTEIN RESIGNS

BRUCE WASSERSTEIN, the powerful investment banker who recently sold his
company, Wasserstein Perella to securities giant Dresdner AG, has resigned.

Wasserstein was under increasing pressure this week to take control over
Lazard LLC. After the sale of Wasserstein Perella earlier this year,
Wasserstein became increasingly sour about the deal; Dresdner recently
agreed to merge with insurer Allianz AG, effectively squelching the plans
Wasserstein had held for the newly merged firm, Dresdner Kleinwort
Wasserstein Securities LLC.

Wasserstein reportedly had numerous qualms about taking over Lazard, however
after weeks of speculation the move was finally made official on November
15, 2001 as Lazard announced that Bruce Wasserstein would join as Head of
Lazard succeeding Michel David-Weill. In a press release issued by Lazard,
Mr. Wasserstein said, ""I am delighted to join Lazard.  We've been discussing
this possibility from time to time for over 15 years.  When I began my own
firm, I aspired for it to become like Lazard.  Lazard has an unmatched
franchise with extraordinarily talented partners.  I look forward to working
with all my new colleagues.""

-----------------------------------------------------------

PIONEER COMPLETES INTEGRATION

As of November 1, 2001, Boston-based Pioneer Investment Management Inc., a
unit of UniCredito Italiano in Milan, successfully completed its yearlong
integration process with the parent company's money management arm in
Dublin.  Executives at both locations will report to Giordano Lombardo,
Global Chief Investment Officer.

Under the new system, research analysts are organized into industry sectors
as opposed to being assigned to particular funds.  Marco Pirondini, Head of
Global Equity Research, manages the team of 34 from Boston.  Focused on
fundamental research, the team is divided into seven groups representing
MSCI global sector categories.  Research is now considered a career track at
Pioneer instead of a training ground to become a fund manager, according to
Steve Graziano, president of sales operations.  ""A stock analyst is a career
unto itself,"" Graziano continued.  ""It's a profession that's paid equally
lucratively as portfolio management, and you become an expert in an
industry.""

Unfortunately, because the reorganization effectively limited her role,
Theresa Hamacher decided to resign as Pioneer's U.S. Chief Investment
Officer effective November 1.  Hamacher's departure had been anticipated
since June, when it was decided that she would report to Mr. Lombardo
instead of to a local chief executive.  Hamacher was not pushed out; Mr.
Graziano said: ""Absolutely not.  Theresa decided the role of CIO was not
what it was when she first got here.  It was less important.""  In a
statement, Mr. Lombardo commented: ""We are disappointed that Theresa has
decided to resign, but respect and understand her decision.  She played a
key role in the development of the investment process of the new Pioneer.""
Hamacher joined Pioneer in 1997 from Prudential Mutual Funds to oversee
stock investments.  The next year she became investment chief and was
assigned to shift Pioneer from a star manager model to a team approach.
Hamacher has not said where she plans to work next.

Pioneer Global Asset Management S.p.A. and its subsidiaries managed
approximately $93 billion as of September 30, 2001 under the name Pioneer
Investments.

BOICH FORMS AVERA GLOBAL PARTNERS

Avera Global Partners, L.P. is a new San Francisco-based hedge fund company
founded this year by JOHN D. BOICH, a former principal and senior portfolio
manager of global equities at Montgomery Asset Management, L.P. Prior to his
departure from Montgomery Asset Management, Boich co-managed the Montgomery
Global Long-Short Fund, the Montgomery Global 20 Fund and the Montgomery
Global Opportunities Fund.  His new venture specializes in alternative
investments and provides investment advisory services for a variety of
vehicles including onshore, offshore and separate accounts.  The main
product of this firm is a global long-short equity fund.

Among those who joined Boich at Avera Global Partners, L.P. are:

-J. PHILLIP OELZE, JR., CFA, President and Chief Operating Officer.  A
former vice president, regional investment manager at Wells Fargo Bank
Arizona N.A., Oelze brings along with him 15 years of operational management
experience.  At Wells Fargo, Oelze directed all operational aspects.

-SCOTT F. KLIMO, CFA, Senior Fundamental Analyst.  Klimo formerly served as
a senior international analyst at Founders Asset Management focusing on
large-cap growth issues.  He has had experience covering continental Europe,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.

-ERIK RENANDER, CFA, Senior Fundamental Analyst.  Like Boich, Renander was
formerly with Montgomery Asset Management, L.P.  He was as an analyst on the
global research team.

-JOSEPHINE CHU, CFA, Senior Quantitative Analyst.  Chu formerly served as a
portfolio manager at Barclays Global Investors where she managed the MSCI
EAFE International Equities Index Funds.  Prior to that, Chu was a portfolio
manager in the quantitative products group at Scudder Kemper Investments,
where she developed and enhanced quantitative models.

-MARK KRESS, CFA, Senior Quantitative Analyst.  Kress formerly served as an
analyst at Trinity Equity Management, where he developed and implemented
quantitative financial screening models and risk management procedures, in
addition to equity valuation models to identify long and short investment
candidates.

-ROBIN UDANY, Senior Trader.  Uday joins the firm from The Cypress Funds,
where she handled the day-to-day trading activities.  Prior to The Cypress
Funds, she created and developed Nomura Securities' Dow Jones Index
Arbitrage desk.  She has also worked as a fixed-income futures and options
specialist and an energy futures and options trader.

-SHADI ABOUKHATER, Senior Trader.  AbouKhater joins Avera from Hilspen
Capital Management where he executed the majority of trades, handling trade
breaks, reconciliation, performance tracking and maintenance of client
accounts.


The firm relies on the belief that relative earnings momentum is what drives
absolute as well as relative stock price performance.  The foundation of the
firm's investment philosophy is built upon the idea that companies with
improving earnings momentum trading at a discount to their region and sector
will outperform, while companies with deteriorating earnings momentum
trading at a premium to their region and sector will under perform.

The firm utilizes both quantitative and qualitative techniques in
identifying long and short candidates from an initial universe of the 2000
largest publicly traded companies globally (excluding emerging markets).

Avera Global Partners uses relative earnings momentum metrics and a
quantitative ranking system built primarily around valuation metrics to
scale down their investment universe.  Fundamental analysis is conducted at
the company and sector level, and modeling tools are used to identify trends
and inflection points in earnings momentum.

As the forecast horizon rarely exceeds six months, the firm tends to focus
on near-term earnings trends.  At the sector level, analysts monitor sector
specific data series such as order trends and inventory levels.  After the
investment universe is narrowed down to a short list of long and short
candidates, the firm employs portfolio optimization technology to help
identify the long and short candidates for the final portfolio.

----------------------------------------------------------

GALLEON REPORTS SANS KRISHEN SUD

For the third quarter ended September 31, 2001, New York-based Galleon
Management L.P. reported ownership of 179 companies, valued at $656.4
million, a decline from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 177 companies, valued at $1.1 billion.

The most probable reason for the decline is the recent departure of former
Galleon healthcare star KRISHEN SUD.  Galleon and Sud recently had a falling
out, following Sud's departure to form healthcare oriented hedge fund Argus
Partners.   In the beginning of June 2001, Sud left the firm with three
other healthcare analysts after failing to get full control of the
healthcare fund. His intentions to leave the firm, however, were not made
known to Galleon's other partners until the day he actually left.  According
to Dow Jones Newswires, ""in a letter to shareholders dated October 4th, Sud
acknowledged making 'several mistakes' in exiting Galleon."" SAM NAVARRO, who
was added to Galleon earlier this year, has since taken over healthcare
responsibilities at Galleon.

Galleon, run by RAJ RAJARATNAM, has traditionally focused on the technology
and healthcare sectors.  Most recently, the firm's investments were
concentrated in technology (72.6%), healthcare (15.8%), and communication
services (4.6%).  Since its previous filing, Galleon reported net inflows
into the technology and communication services sector, and a net reduction
in its holdings in healthcare, financials, and consumer staples.

Top five holdings for the third quarter ended September 31, 2001 included:
Cisco Systems Inc. [CSCO] with 3,871,188 shares (valued at $47.2 million);
Microsoft Corp. [MSFT] with 750,000 shares (valued at $38.4 million); Texas
Instruments Inc. [TXN] with 1,400,000 shares (valued at $35.0 million);
Solectron Corp. [SLR] with 2,892,500 shares (valued at $33.7 million); and,
Nvida Corp. [NVDA] with 917,000 shares (valued at $25.2 million).

The firm's top new positions included the firm's purchase of Nvidia.
Rounding out the firm's top five included Semiconductor Holders Trust (Dep
Rcpt) [SMH] with 539,500 shares (valued at $14.8 million); Dell Computer
Corp. [DELL] with 724,600 shares (valued at $13.4 million); and, Qualcomm
Inc. [QCOM] with 261,200 shares (valued at $12.4 million).

 	 	    Dear Jason,  President Bush wrapped up his energy tour by signing two executive orders during a visit to Pennsylvania today.  The first order speeds up the approval process for new energy projects, and the second instructs the federal government to pay close attention to energy when making key decisions.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford reports there will be movement on major energy initiatives in the Senate next week, including debate on President Bush's national energy policy.     Also from the Washington bureau, Jay expects a Senate oversight hearing on Wednesday on the president's plan, with Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham as the only witness.  On Thursday we can expect a legislative hearing on several energy bills, including Senate Energy Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski's National Energy Security Act of 2001 and Senator Jeff Bingaman's Comprehensive and Balanced Energy Policy Act, among others.   Additionally, Jay says the Senate Energy Committee is scheduled to vote next Wednesday on FERC nominees Pat Wood and Nora Brownell.  We have a full week from ENL's Washington bureau, so log on for all the details next week.       From ENL's Houston bureau, Gale Smith reports we're scheduled to bring you more on the North American Electric Reliability Council of Texas placing the state on a ""monitoring list"" of potential spots for summer electricity troubles because of computer conversion.  Gale also reports we're scheduled to speak with American Regional Contact for KPMG Bill Kimble.  Kimble is set to discuss the convergence of major energy and electronic communications companies and the anticipation of future partnerships.  Catch Bill Kimble in the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.      Also from Houston next week, Dorothea El Mallakh, the Executive Director of the International Research Center for Energy and Economic Development is scheduled to join us.  She'll explain why the energy issue isn't a problem that can be solved quickly.  LPG Journalist for Petroleum Argus Zeeba Llorens is also scheduled to stop by the Houston bureau.  She'll discuss the rising cost of butane and propane.  Dorothea El Mallakh and Zeeba Llorens will both join us later in the week.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.  Have a fantastic weekend!
