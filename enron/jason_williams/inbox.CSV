Hi Debra;
Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
proposed amendment for your review/execution.

It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
party.

Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.

If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

"","Hey all... We have set up id's on several new gates and pipelines for Enovate starting April 1, so now we are able to nominate directly from Enovate without going thru Enron North America.    I am trying to be consistent on how we nominate the gas so that when accounting looks at Unify/Sitara and the pipeline/ldc statements everything ties out nicely.   

We had a couple of situations this morning where Peoples (Bob Hayes) and Peoples Energy Services (Jeanette Mendoza) were getting conflicting information as to which Enron entity they should be nominating from.  

For example,   at the beginning of the month we call every counterparty and confirm volumes.  We called Peoples Energy Services and said that Enovate was selling 5,000 to them on deal #695025.  We nominated the gas to Peoples Energy Services for 4/1/01-4/30/01 from Enovate.    When the on call rep at PGLC for the weekend looked at our noms vs. Peoples Energy Services noms,  there was a mismatch due to the upstream counterparty Peoples Energy Services was using.  Therefore Irene had to change Peoples Energy Services nomination.  This was not a huge deal, but it is time consuming and confusing for the ldc reps at PGLC.    Jeanette at Peoples Energy Services called me this morning to say that she had talked to  Paul and that he had told  her that she should be nominating from Enron North America NOT Enovate and that was how they had nominated the gas.    I explained that we had several Enron entities and that Enovate was actually selling the gas to her and that was how we nominated the gas to her on PGLC (this is also how the deals are in both Sitara and Unify).  I also told her that we would make sure and call if that changed and Enron North America sold her gas as well as Enovate.

I was thinking that whenever there is a question on how to nominate your deals  if you would refer your counterparty to either myself or Margie.  Then if we have a question we can go to you.   That way we are in the loop as well and can be proactive in making sure that everyone is nominating from the correct Enron entity and also avoid confusion for everyone in the chain from the supply to the market to the pipe/ldc.  


Thanks again!!!

"Cut on ANR to Peoples Gas Contract 104684","Jason,
	I verbally confirmed the cut that occurred for gas day May 30th with
Irene Isais of our Gas Transportation Services department.  Peoples ANR
contract 104684 was cut by 6,599 MMBtu throughout the May 30th gas day.

The supply was cut because PGL Gas Supply was not told by Enron North
America that the Northern Border supply @ Will County had been reallocated
on different contracts.  All four GISB cycles were exercised in an attempt
to receive the entire 40,000 but since the contract mismatch was not
corrected until the final cycle, Peoples lost 6,599 MMBtu for the day.

Peoples reduced its SIQ purchase from 125,000 to 118,401 for gas day May
30th.

Jeanette is not reporting it is because North Shore took that supply to

North Shore reduced its SIQ purchase of 10,000 for the 21st by 10 MMBtu.

Jason, 

Effective November 1, 2001 your salary should be transferred to Hunter Shively's cost center: 107317.   I need you to enter this new cost center into your timesheet.  The way that you do this is to enter the new cost center number into the space that says Rec. CCtr for November 1 - 15th.  Also, you will need to manually enter 8 hours worked for each day so that SAP will pick up your time and expenses and put them in the new cost center.  You will also need to do the same thing for November 16 - 30th.   

Please write me back and let me know that you have received this message.  Also, please call me with any additional questions.  

Thanks for your time and assistance in this matter.

Elizabeth,
The best way to get Jason's salary transferred to the correct cost center (since it is only one pay period back), is to have him go into his SAP timesheet and have him code his time to the new cost center.  This way the system (SAP) will correct all his payroll costs automatically.  
If you need help explaining to him how to do this, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian

	The May 30th cut to Peoples ANR contract 104684 is now 4,856 MMBtu.
ANR revised its morning allocation.  It now confirms 35,144 for Peoples Gas

adjusted upward by 1,743 to 35,144.

Peoples will reduce its SIQ purchase by 4,856.  Therefore, 125,000 of SIQ

"Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call","Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"...hmmmm...","Jason,  it's me, Jay Elms.  You know, Amanda's husband.

What's going on?  I understand you and Ferg are only playing about 72 holes
of golf per week.  Down from the normal 96.  I'm up to about 18 holes every
6 months.  I'll dominate both of you when we play again.  Ya'll need to come
visit us in Austin.

Hey, I've got a buddy I worked with that also got laid off.. he was in
corporate communications for us.  Can you get the name of someone in Enron's
Corp. communications dept.?  He is interested in Enron and I told him you
were the president of the company and could basically hand him a job if he
wanted it..

If you can get a name, that would be fine.. if not, no problem.

Thanks,
Gay

"db outage","David,

	Bryan referred me to you.  We are supporting the People's Energy website which interfaces with an Oracle db.  
It has been functioning properly until recently.  I currently do not have insight to see what the connection string is in production,
but when trying to connect to the development database ""peoplesdev"", using U=peoples_user P=peoples_user, I am receiving the
error ""ORACLE not available"".

Do you know if this database is out, or if the login parameters have changed?

Thanks,

David Dronet

"Forward: Broadcast Message - Trading Floor Stentofons","With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

"FW: HR Headcount Report","Jason, 

Effective November 1, 2001 your salary should be transferred to Hunter Shively's cost center: 107317.   I need you to enter this new cost center into your timesheet.  The way that you do this is to enter the new cost center number into the space that says Rec. CCtr for November 1 - 15th.  Also, you will need to manually enter 8 hours worked for each day so that SAP will pick up your time and expenses and put them in the new cost center.  You will also need to do the same thing for November 16 - 30th.   

Please write me back and let me know that you have received this message.  Also, please call me with any additional questions.  

Thanks for your time and assistance in this matter.

Elizabeth,
The best way to get Jason's salary transferred to the correct cost center (since it is only one pay period back), is to have him go into his SAP timesheet and have him code his time to the new cost center.  This way the system (SAP) will correct all his payroll costs automatically.  
If you need help explaining to him how to do this, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","

Subject:	Logistics Commercial Realignment


After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","[IMAGE]
 	 	    Dear Jason,  I'm Washington Correspondent Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts while he's on vacation this week.   On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us reports previewing the 115th OPEC Conference from Vienna, Austria.  On Tuesday, the OPEC Conference gets underway with Wolfgang bringing us live reports from the conference throughout the day.  Wolfgang says on Wednesday he's scheduled to have an interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  Don't miss the Rodriguez interview or Wolfgang's live reports from Vienna on Tuesday and Wednesday.   We're going to be busy in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday.  For starters, President Bush is scheduled to meet with heads of several national environmental groups at the White House.  We'll bring you an update on their meeting Tuesday.   However, the biggest news from Washington is the change of power taking place in the Senate.  Tuesday evening Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords is expected to officially leave the Republican Party, thereby giving Democrats control of the Senate for the first time since 1994.  The change in power is a huge blow to the Republicans' chances of passing the Bush administration's national energy policy.  We'll have more on these developments on Tuesday.     From our Houston bureau, ENL's Gale Smith reports she'll bring us a package on a minority-owned energy business on Tuesday.   The Houston-based company refurbishes pipelines and flow-measurement equipment, and employs mostly minorities.  Correspondent Kim Benestante says the Houston bureau will also bring us a report on the Valero Corporation.  Valero executed lease agreements with purchase options for a 115,000 barrel per day refinery currently owned by El Paso in Corpus Christi, Texas.  The Houston bureau is scheduled to bring us all the details on these stories and more on Tuesday.   Also from our Houston bureau, Omega Oil Company's Andy Ashby is scheduled to join us.  He'll discuss below the reservoir production methods, coal bed methane production and domestic oil and gas production.  We'll speak with Ashby in the 12:00 p.m. ET newscast on Tuesday.   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.  Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Keep it on energynewslive.com  for all your energy news.

"VERY IMPORTANT ENRONONLINE  STACK MANAGER CHANGES","
We will be releasing new version of the Stack Manager and the EnronOnline website tonight . The following are the changes

1. Changes to Stack Manager:

1.1 Changes to toolbar icons:
To facilitate further development of the system, it has been found necessary to change the toolbar icons at the top of the Stack  Manager. The attached file shows the old icon and its new replacement. Next to each image below is the description of the function that is executed as well as the short cut key that is mapped to the same function:

 

1.2 New Functionality - Auto Suspend
The Auto Suspend function allows traders to set an absolute price change from a price level at which you would like the system to automatically suspend a specific product. This function is useful if your products use automatic price resets.

To activate this feature:
1. Select a product and click on Product Properties
2. Check the Enable box
3. Enter the Price Check and Suspend at +/- values
4. Click Update
Example: a trader Enables Auto Suspend and selects a $35.00 Price Check and a suspension level of +/- $5.00: The system will suspend the product when the mid price is above  $40.00 or below $30.00

You will need to enter a new Price Check or disable the Auto Suspend function to reactivate this Product if the Auto Suspend is triggered.  
Please note the system checks for any products that need to be suspended once a minute.


2. Changes to EnronOnline Website
 (These changes will be rolled out in phases over the next week and will be available to all customers only by Friday 5/4/01)

The following enhancements have been made to the EnronOnline Website:

2.1 Today's Transactions

Float Window:  In order to float the window, right click on the Today's Transactions section, click on the Float Window option.

Sort Ordering: Click on the column heading to change the sort order. 

Linked Transactions: You can display the linked Transactions in an expanded or collapsed view. To do so, right click in the Transaction display area and select full Expand or Full Collapse.

2.2 Submission Box

The submission box has been modified in order to show a space between each set of ""zeros"" for the volume the customer wants to sell/buy.

The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.  Terrell Davis , RB DEN - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for Sunday's game against ! Mi! ami. He will practice this week before a final decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.  Keith Poole , WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from a rib injury.  James Jackson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.  Neil Rackers , K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is 9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter based on his struggles.  Akili Smith , QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to No. 2 quarterback, according to The Cincinnati Enquirer . ""If that's what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me,"" Smith said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.  Terry Allen , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.  Moe! ! Williams , RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back, and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.  Wayne Chrebet , WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 11/27/01 Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However, The New York Newsday reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's game.   Jake Arians , K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to replace him.   Edgerrin James , RB IND - JWillie Updated 11/27/0!  Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his left knee was successful Saturday in Miami.  Mora said he received the news from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. ""I spoke with him Saturday and he told me it went very well,"" Mora said. James, the two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be ready for the start of training camp.     Terry Glenn , WR NE - Matty Updated 11/27/01 Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps the end of his Patriots career. ""I haven't reached it yet,"" coach Bill Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. ""But as each day goes by, it gets a little bit closer.""      Shayne Graham , K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start of the season.   Stephen Alexander , TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.  Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 11/27/01 Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17 loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game.   Kevan Barlow , RB SF - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over Indianapolis. ""It's throbbing,"" Barlow told the Contra Costa Times. ""I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's hurting."" Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo, so be sure to place him on reserve.     Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a protecti! ve! boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners face Buffalo.   Jeff Thomason , TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington. He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player.   Donald Driver , WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event.   Tyrone Davis , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve or cut him altogehter.   James Stewart , RB DET - Hunter Updated 11/27/01 ! Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him.   Charlie Batch , QB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 According to the Detroit Free Press , Batch is expected to start Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. ""This is Charlie's offense,"" coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""He practiced a little bit today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect him close to full speed Wednesday."" He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury. The veteran tight end is listed as day to day.   Anthony Thomas , RB CHI - Martin Update! d ! 11/27/01 According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week.   Brad Hoover , RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New Orleans.   Chris Weinke , QB CAR - Tori Updated 11/27/01 Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. ""There've been quarterbacks who have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"" coach George Seifert told the Charlotte Observer. ""Even though there are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial than not."" While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01 Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland. However, ! he! is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. ""I'll be there,"" Sanders told the Arizona Republic. ""They're just real sore from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear."" In any event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough Oakland secondary.   Rob Moore , WR ARI - Martin Updated 11/27/01 Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but he ended up doing nothing of the sort. ""He hasn't made a lot of progress,"" coach Dave McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""We're going to come to a point where we're going to have to make a decision."" Moore, who has missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured reserve list this week.   More Updates [IMAGE]  Copyright 2001 Commissioner.COM Inc and SportsLine.com Inc.

"Happy Thanksgiving","Hi Jason,
First of all, just want to wish you Joanna a happy thanksgiving.  We certainly have a lot to be thankful for.  Susan and I are leaving tonight visit her dad.  I'm going up to Wisconsin to visit Mimi in two weeks.  She still sound very tired.
Hear a lot of stuff about Enron.  I hope you are still doing OK.  I'm sure you've created value for yourself and should be fine.  It is just amazing to see a company that size make the mistakes that it did. But, the bottom line is that it is run by humans.  And that is how we learn.
Are you going to the game on Friday?  It would be great to see A&M pull out a win.
Love,
Dad

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Here Kitty, Kitty, Kitty","

This one is pretty good!  Hope everyone is doing well!



This is unbelievable!  Read the story first.....then look at the picture.

Rodger Degagne a former employee with AECL in Chalk River may be embarking on a
new career as Feline breeder.  Relaxing in his spacious home on the shores of
the Ottawa River, Mr. Degagne recalls how 15 years ago he befriended two stray
young cats on the old AECL research facility at Chalk River.  The kittens had
appeared in late summer and apparently had gotten under a security fence around
the old labs abandoned since the late 50s.  With the help of his tuna sandwich,
Mr. Degagne was able to coax the kitties close enough so that he could pick them
up.  A self-described animal lover, he did not want to place the kittens in the
local Humane Society.  In this largely rural area, cats of all stripes and age
largely go unwanted and are humanely disposed of after a few days.  Later that
evening, his wife Louise and their two children, Nicole and Kelly came to a
family decision to keep the kittens which they named Lost and Found.  Lost
turned out to be female and Found a male.

When nature finally took its course, a litter of kittens was born six years
later.  One of the litter was a big white female with a unique black markings on
her side and tail.  Something about the kitten captured the hearts of the family
and while her siblings eventually found homes elsewhere.  Snowball stayed with
the Degagnes.

While Lost and Found are no longer with us, their progeny live on. In her nine
years Snowball's size has seemed to snowball.  Put simply, Snowball is no
ordinary cat; she measures 69 inches from nose to tail and weighs in at 87 lbs.
""She started out a big kitty and she just seemed to keep growing.

She always meowed for more food, and would climb up on the counter to eat food
which I forgot to cover.  Chicken is her favorite.  Once I left a cooked chicken
on the table that I was going to use for a boat picnic; an hour later, the
chicken was gone,"" Louise said.  ""We knew that Snowball wasn't your average cat
when the neighbors' German Shepherd ran yelping away from his first encounter
with her.  She just isn't afraid of any animals.  After we found a half-eaten
raccoon out by the garage, we decided that maybe Snowball should be kept fenced
in.  We soon discovered that while we can keep Snowball in the yard, we couldn't
keep raccoons from Snowball.  ""At least it kept the food bills down,"" Rodger
laughed. ""Like all female cats, she is very territorial, but with us she is just
a big ol' kitten,"" he said.

So what does an 87-lb. cat eat?  ""Snowball goes through about three lbs. of cat
food a day, along with cooked chicken , supplemented with deer and moose that
Rodger hunts in the fall.  She likes pike a lot, so I don't throw them back
anymore.""  Snowball often accompanies Rodger fishing on the Ottawa, eagerly
peering over the side of the boat as soon as his line goes tight.

So to what do the Degagnes attribute Snowball's size?  Rodger says, ""Well, the
vet thinks it could be her thyroid, but she isn't fat; she's just a real big
cat.  I think maybe her parents got into something at Chalk River that they
shouldn't have.""

"Tuesday","Gals,

Hey guys!  I am feeling a little happier today...we had sunshine yesterday!
And I took full advantage of it.  I took the boys out to the playground in
the backyard at 1100 and didn't come in until 5pm!  I even grilled hotdogs
and hamburgers for lunch for 8 kids and 5 moms!  We had one big picnic.  Our
location with the neighborhood playground in our backyard is perfect--I
couldn't ask for better.  There is even a big sand pit for them to play in.
And now the kids are old enough to run around while I lounge on our patio
watching them from a distance.  I wish ya'll could see it.  I guess Jo will
have a chance in about 3 weeks though!

Nolan did nap on the couch for a few hours but Jason did not.  Jason could
not keep his eyes open once we came inside.  I immediately gave them baths
(at 5pm) and put pj's on.  We have peanut butter and jelly for dinner while
I prodded Jason to stay awake.  It was good though--they both slept in until
7:30am this morning.

Today, it looks like a pretty day as well.  I have already been jogging and
dropped Jason off at pre-school.  Now I have to figure out how to be at
volleyball practice (we are having a battalion wives' volleyball challenge
on Thursday) at 11am-12:30, pick-up Jason from pre-school at 1130am and drop
off my friend for her family pictures at noon.  Seems kind of impossible!
Hopefully I will get my neighbor to get Jason from preschool.  Then I need
to feed the boys and nap them so that they are well rested for their
photo-op at 4pm this afternoon.  I think I might just do jean shorts and
white T-shirts since I can't find any dress clothes for them.  Finally,
tonight, I am suppose to play in my first soccer game with my German Women's
team at 6:30pm.  It exhausts me just thinking of everything.

The kinderfest went well.  I made home-made colored clay for ""handprints and
clay creations!""  I had to make 20 batches of clay (120 baseball size balls
of clay).  It took me over 4 hours and my arm was cramping from stirring all
the batches.  Luckily Wayne came home and helped with the last 5 batches.
We used over 100 balls of it at the Kinderfest and I think the kids enjoyed
it!  Unfortunately we didn't sign anyone up for the AFTB classes but did
hand out some info on them.

The boys are doing well.  Jason got some splinters in his foot yesterday and
it was very traumatic this morning trying to get them out.  Nolan is talking
up a storm but prefers using one to two word phrases still.  However, he can
count to 12 on his own--it is amazing!  Jason is Nolan's teacher.  He reads
him books and asks Nolan questions like:  ""Nolan, where is the oval?...Good
job Nolan!... Now, where is the square?""  Jason can officially dress himself
(minus the socks--he still doesn't do socks)!  This makes life a bit easier
for me.

On another note, I like Oprah's idea of a marriage sabatical.  Maybe we can
plan one for all of us--oh, I guess that would be a girl's weekend!  Well,
Nolan just walked in and asked me to come downstairs with him to watch
Caillou--how can I refuese that offer!

Love and miss you,
T

Please change in Global Counterparty.

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. Picks and pans: Telecom favorites and has-beens
Charles Payne rates 17 telecom stocks that sank like hot air balloons for their
ability to regain altitude or not.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

The telecommunications sector's equipment makers has been at the root of all
the heartache felt by investors over the last two-years; it represents the
bloated inventories and even more bloated valuations; investors thought they
were gliding to a land of early retirements, vacation homes and endless toys when
the balloon began to lose air (it didn't pop, but behaved more like a hot air
balloon that descended faster and faster as it approached a hard landing).
Like visionaries in love with a concept, investors are still in love with
the telecommunications space and will continue to bet on the balloon recovering
altitude and taking flight once more. I agree that some of these balloons will
indeed become airborne, but getting them off the ground will be trickier than
advertised.

2. Upwards revisions: Better and better
Rather than taking the sector as a whole, investors should consider individual
opportunities.

By Dave Sterman

Recessions are something of a double-edged sword for investors. On the one hand,
sales growth slows for many of their portfolio companies, taking share prices
on a southbound trajectory. But for those with cash to spare, they have a rare
chance to buy quality companies at fire sale prices.

With that in mind, we went screening for long-term winners in the telecom sector
that are now quite cheap. We specifically sought out stocks that are now fairly
inexpensive when compared to their historical earnings growth rate. As the
accompanying table shows, these stocks have a PEG (price/earnings ratio in
relation to earnings growth) of below 0.7.

And to make sure that analyst sentiment corroborates the attractive valuation,
we insisted these stocks be supported by at least three ""strong buy"" ratings,
and that analysts have raised their ratings over the last three months.

3. Upside potential: Unusual support looms for tower stocks
Debt burdens and zoning laws may seem like unlikely benefits, but there you
have it.

By Dave Sterman

Toss another sector into the telecom rubble. Shares of cell tower operators
are hitting new lows and now sell for just a small fraction of their peaks.
Curiously, on many levels, the sector is fairly healthy; revenues are strong,
and major players have been able to avoid the cutthroat price wars that have
characterized the rest of the telecom industry.

That apparent disconnect could spell an opportunity for investors with a strong
stomach for a long and bumpy ride. These firms are saddled with eye-popping
levels of debt, but should soon benefit from a much more rational operating
landscape. Weaker players are on the ropes, and their eventual demise will enable
the stronger players to get back on their feet as they garner a bigger slice of
the pie.

4. International wires: From Russia with love
A troika of telecom stocks that are well-positioned for current trends and gaining
analyst esteem.

BYLINE: Ben Mattlin, equity research columnist

When shares of Russian-based telecom companies start earning a measure of analyst
esteem, savvy investors owe it to themselves to take a further look.

To be sure, these three Russian telcos haven't yet attained analysts' highest rating,
but quite surprisingly--and seemingly out of nowhere--each has an average rating better
than a neutral 3, and one of them has moved up to an average rating of 2 (""buy"").
What gives?

5. Changing directions: Mobile phone makers eye wireless Internet opportunity
Companies look past current troubles toward growing the mobile data market

by John Filar Atwood, equity research columnist

Worsening economic conditions have caused a major strategic shift in the mobile
handset industry. The segment's top companies have begun to de-emphasize phone
sales and are eyeing the wireless Internet as a key driver of future revenues.

It's no surprise given recent industry performance. Third quarter handset
shipments were down by 10% over last year. Motorola's (MOT) sales fell by 22%
in the quarter, and Ericsson's (ERICY) phone operations have been so damaging
to its bottom line that the company finally moved them into a joint venture with
Sony (SNE).

"Internet E-mail","
In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"Less gas with Beano?","A friend has sent you a Q&A from Ask Dr. Weil (http://www.drweil.com).

Reply to your friend at williamsj@iconus.com

Read this... especially the paragraph about allergies.  You need to make an appt. with an ENT - soon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

<font size=-1>(Published 2/21/97)</font> Well, I have to say yes and no. Beano is a plant enzyme that helps your body digest some sugars that the body can't process. Usually these are broken down by bacteria in the gut, resulting in the formation of methane, which is to say, <A HREF=""http://www.medicinenet.com/mainmenu/encyclop/ARTICLE/ART_G/gas.htm"" TARGET=""_new"">gas</A>. 	 <p>You have to take a few drops of Beano with the first bite of the food that causes the problem. Some people will tell you that it works great, and others will tell you that it doesn't work at all. I'd say it works somewhat.   <p>The difference in effects may be related to the different reasons why people get gas. Many people <A HREF=""http://www.tv.cbc.ca/healthshow/pastitem/1997/lactose.html"" TARGET=""_new"">can't digest milk</A> because they lack a necessary enzyme, called lactase, for breaking down milk sugar. For them, Lactaid or Dairy Ease may prove more useful. Beano does not break down lactose, but!
 does handle stachyose and raffinose, two of the problematic sugars in beans.  <p>Others get gas because they swallow a lot of air while they're eating. This can become a problem if you have a cold, or if you have allergies or a sinus condition and tend to breathe through your mouth. My advice: Take smaller bites and notice when you're breathing.   <p>If Beano doesn't work for you, you can try other natural preventive measures against gas. Some people swear by <A HREF=""http://www.frontierherb.com/spices/kkl/kkl.notes.anise.seed.html"" TARGET=""_new"">anise</A> or fennel seeds, which are gastric stimulants. <A HREF=""http://essentialgarden.com/news/hblurb/sect/001_001_10_001.html"" TARGET=""_new"">Acidophilus</A> will keep your intestine in healthy working order. Papaya enzyme just after a meal may also help.   <p>Other strategies would be to select beans that are naturally low in the difficult sugars. The best are Anasazi beans, a mutant variety of pinto beans that look much pretti!
er. Black beans are also very good. Some of the worst offenders are pea beans and navy beans.   <p>You can also ease the problem somewhat by soaking the beans overnight, then throwing away the water and replacing it with fresh water for cooking. People who eat beans regularly are less likely to have problems. So rather than staying away from these extremely nutritious foods, go for it. And certainly give Beano a try.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

- Hatcher: I am up for playing.
- Scott: I might be.  I need to talk to Kathy about it first.
- Von: see you then
- Jason: no e-mail reply, but his assumed answer is, ""I don't reply until
the very latest possible time so that I have an opportunity to look at all
of my options and chose the one that matches my interest that particular
day, hour, or minute."" :-)  Actually, Jason told Sharon that he was in last
night, but he may change his mind after that dig.
- Mike: out
- Todd: out

We definitely have three (Von, Jason, and me).  If all of the maybes come
(Ferg, Hatcher, & Scott), we will have six.  Please confirm if you can make
it tonight.

"Organization Announcement","Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

"RE:","Hey bud, it is great to hear from you.  Congrats on the promotion... you
will do an awesome job!!!  I hope you get a chance to go to italy, it is
really beautiful and you will enjoy it immensely.  It took about 3 weeks to
go through the Panama Canal and get to Hawaii and we pulled into port for
about 4 1/2 days.  We had a great time, but I'm really looking forward to
Hawaii on the way back because we are going to be there for a week and
Cassandra is going to join me.  We are heading further west and will
participate in some maneuvers in a couple of days.  I can't tell you where
because our satellite might be monitered but Cassey knows.  I got an e-mail
from John Ohlenburg the other day... that was pretty random.  He is coming
back to Houston so maybe you will run into him.  Thanks for writing and I'm
glad to hear that everything is going well.  Say hello to Joanna for me and
I can't wait to come home and hang out with y'all!  I talked with Ferg about
getting a hunting trip together.  I miss you Bud.  Adios!!!!

Hey Buddy,
     Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work
and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing
back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have
you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is
goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new
Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good
lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and
Sarah had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.
I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am
now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm
still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full
responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but
the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's
brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and
started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July
1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty
cool!  Jo is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and
she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September
for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along.
The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course
are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty
inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.
How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss
seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and
listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to
seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  ""You and
your faggoty white uniforms.""  Just kiddin -

                              Peace

"Greg's Bachelor Party","For those of you that do not know, we are planning
greg's bachelor party for the weekend of May 19th.

We've rented a beach house in Surfside.  The beach
house is front row on the portion of the beach that
allows open fires and automobiles on the beach...both
very cool things.

We have the house Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.
Jeff, Greg, and I will probably arrive Friday night,
however the main shindig will get kicked off on
Saturday night.  I don't exactly know what the main
shindig is, but we realize that most people won't be
able to pull themselves away from their miserable
lives for an entire weekend.  Jeff, Greg, and I
however, will make sure that the keg is working
properly friday evening.

So what I need from you is a confirmation that you
will:
A - Be there Friday and Saturday
B - Be there Sometime Saturday, Leave sometime
Saturday
C - Be there Saturday, Leave Sunday
D - Can't make it.  Dallas is too far from Surfside.

Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire
weekend.  So depending on how many people we get the
price should be between $60-$100 per person.  Each
person will be responsible for their own food, and a
sleeping bag/pillow, etc.  No linens are provided,
(I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think
they have a grill so that's the important thing.  Greg
will confirm.

Cards, Dominoes', booze, beach shit, etc.  are other
good items to bring.

We will send specific directions at a later time.

Let me know your status so we can get a better handle
on costs.  I will pass on more info (costs/directions)
as we get it.

Later.

"Important News For Our Texas Customers","June 8, 2001


Dear JASON WILLIAMS:

We are delighted that you have made a smart energy choice by signing up
with NewPower(tm) as part of the Texas Electric Choice Pilot Program.
Tens of thousands of Texas households have joined you in taking advantage
of the tremendous savings NewPower will provide you over the next two years.

As your new energy supplier, we wanted to make sure that you were informed
of a recent development affecting you as a participant of the pilot
program. NewPower was recently notified by the Texas Public Utility
Commission (PUC) that the pilot program will be phased in more slowly
over the summer months. A more gradual timetable for processing switches
from your local utility to energy service providers, such as NewPower,
will help to ensure a seamless transition between energy suppliers for
the thousands of Texans who have enrolled in the program.

Click below to read the official announcement from the Texas PUC. This
requires you to have Adobe Acrobat Reader:
http://i2.innovyx.com/newpower/pilot_ltr.pdf

If you do not have Adobe Acrobat Reader, please click below and follow
instructions for free download:
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_46_994

What does this mean for you? It simply means that your NewPower service
will begin during July instead of June as originally planned. Until then,
your existing provider will continue to provide your electricity,
uninterrupted. Rest assured, once your NewPower service begins, you'll
still get the same great rates and excellent customer service you were
promised when you signed up.

There is no need for you to take any action.  NewPower expects that the
Texas Public Utility Commission will enable us to begin providing your
household with electric service after July 6th.

In the meantime, NewPower will send a welcome letter notifying you of the
effective date of your NewPower service.  If you have any questions or
concerns, please visit the Public Utility Commission's website at
http://tr.innovyx.com/redir.asp?148_47_994 or call NewPower
at 877-819-9817. (For help in Spanish, call 1-866-523-4176.)

Best regards, and welcome to NewPower!

Nick Utton
Chief Marketing Officer

Watch for those details from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday.   We'll have an interview from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday.

	The following reductions will be deducted from Peoples daily SIQ
purchase of 125,000 MMBtu/day.  For the 19th, our Transportation Services
area reports that Peoples was cut by 1,158 MMBtu (780 @ TTP and 378 @ Border
Will County to ANR Contract 104684). Here is a revised breakdown of the
19th:

PGL Baseload                103,081

For the 20th, Peoples was cut by 2,025 MMBtu (1,272 @ TTP and 753 @ Border

PGL SIQ                        122,975 (125,000 minus 2,025)

For the 21st, Peoples was cut by 96 MMBtu (62 @ TTP and 34 @ Border Will
County to ANR Contract 104684).  The 21st should now look like the
following:

PGL SIQ                        124,904 (125,000 minus 96)

MOORE CAPITAL: GROWING IN NEW DIRECTIONS

After the retirement of hedge fund gurus George Soros and Julian Robertson
and the more recent announcement of the split of Bowman Capital Management
and Pequot Capital Management, Moore has quickly moved to the head of this
alternative investment class, although not without its own problems.

Recently the firm has been marred by a series of high profile departures
that began last year with the departure of equity strategist Stanley
Shopkorn.  In the past few months, however, the number of departures has
increased significantly as some of the firm's employees have taken financial
backing from their former employer and splintered off to form their own
hedge funds.

In a situation quite similar to that of Pequot's Arthur Samberg and Dan
Benton, (who is taking some of Pequot's assets to launch Andor Capital
Management), Moore Capital has experienced its own split.  In March 2001,
Moore Capital's technology and telecom group, led by TONY ANAGNOSTAKIS, left
the firm to start the Agnos Group.  With seed money provided by Moore
Capital, Agnos Group maintains a close relationship with Moore.  The firm's
team is composed of Managing Director PETER SWARTZ, Senior Analysts RYAN
SPAYDE and ALEX KOTLYAR, and DANIEL MACCARRONE and ROBERT YUEN.  Around the
same time, JOANNE SOJA, a health care fund manager with Moore Capital, left
the firm to launch Maximus Capital with the help of MSDW's Teresa McRoberts
and Galleon's Prem Lachman.  The Financial Times reported that Maximus, a
health care hedge fund, is backed by Moore Capital.

With the formation of the Agnos Group and Maximus Capital, it appears as if
Moore has expanded into a fund of funds approach, while maintaining its own
hedge funds and private equity ventures.  In addition to expanding other
areas of its business, the firm is also expanding into new locations.  Moore
Capital Management recently hired Thomas Weisel Asset Management's former
chief investment officer Mark Waterhouse to lead the firm's new Boston
office. Prior to joining Thomas Weisel in January 2000, Waterhouse was
employed with Wellington Management Company, LLP where he managed the
Hartford Small Company Fund, Inc.  Additionally, the firm hired former
Putnam Investment Management analyst Brian Pinsker to head the firm's
healthcare group in Boston.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, Moore Capital Management's 13F filing
reported $473.0 million in equity assets invested in a portfolio of 70
companies.  This was a dramatic decline from the previous quarter in which
the firm reported $1.4 billion in equity assets invested in a portfolio of
164 companies.

While some may consider ever shrinking 13F filings as evidence of a firm in
trouble, in fact, just the opposite may be true.  When reviewing the 13F
filings of many hedge funds, it is important to remember that these filings
are not always an accurate representation of a firm's true equity assets as
a result of the variety of investing techniques available to hedge funds.
For example, when a firm shorts a stock, essentially borrowing shares that
it will attempt to replace at a lower price thus making money off of the
difference, this will often appear on a 13F as a purchase when in fact they
are just replacing the shares.

Moore Capital's portfolio was invested across a wide variety of industries,
including financials (21.0%), basic materials (17.6%), diversified (13.7%),
consumer staples (12.4%), and communication services (9.3%).  Technology,
which was the second most widely held sector at the end of 2000 with 20.1%,
dropped to only 2.4% in the first quarter of 2001, likely a result of the
formation of the Agnos Group.  The majority of the selling in Moore's
portfolio was felt in the firm's financials, consumer cyclicals, technology
and health care holdings.

New positions for the quarter included Voicestream Wireless Corp. [VSTR]
with 449,909 shares valued at $41.6 million; Burlington Resources Inc. [BR]
with 550,000 shares valued at $24.6 million; Ambac Financial Group Inc.
[ABK] with 200,600 shares valued at $12.7 million; Calpine Corp. [CPN] with
197,900 shares valued at $10.9 million; and, Exelon Corp. [EXC] with 150,000
shares valued at $9.8 million.

Top holdings for the first quarter of 2001 included: Honeywell International
Inc. [HON] with 1,586,400 shares valued at $64.7 million; Quaker Oats Co.
[OAT] with 505,800 shares valued at $49.1 million; Apex Silver Mines [SIL]
with 5,734,266 shares valued at $45.6 million; Voicestream Wireless Corp.
[VSTR] with 449,909 shares valued at $41.6 million; and, Burlington
Resources Inc. [BR] with 550,000 shares valued at $24.6 million.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

MAVERICK INCREASES EQUITY ASSETS AGAIN

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, Dallas-based hedge fund Maverick
Capital Ltd. reported ownership of 94 companies valued at $7.2 billion, an
increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported ownership of 109
companies valued at $6.5 billion.  The firm has distinguished itself from
many other high-flying hedge funds by continuing to consecutively increase
its equity assets under management quarter to quarter.

Top macro-sector weightings this quarter included consumer cyclicals
(20.6%), consumer staples (14.0%) and health care (13.2%).  Maverick was
more bearish on financials and health care, as those sectors declined as a
percentage of the firm's portfolio despite an increasing asset base.

Technology came in at 12.4% of the portfolio.  One year ago, technology
comprised approximately 18.7%.  Maverick, unlike many of its peers, was able
to stick to its GARP-based investment approach.  Indeed, for more than the
past year, the firm's portfolio P/E has remained below that of the S&P 500.


LEE AINSLIE's Maverick Capital considers itself an ""opportunistic"" investor,
picking up quality companies when prices are considered favorable.   The
firm identifies potential candidates for the portfolio using bottom-up
fundamental analysis.  Maverick looks closely at financial statements for a
financial turnaround and diversifies its portfolio across differing
industrial categories and regions.

ACTIVE FUNDS MOVE INTO ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY

While many hedge funds protect their principals by shorting stocks and
utilizing a variety of derivatives, some hedge funds attempt to bolster
their returns using active trading strategies.  Whether the investment
approach is merger arbitrage or classic long/short, the aggressive movement
of assets may enable a hedge fund to garner solid returns in a historically
volatile market.  Nonetheless, the firms' portfolios often represent more
recent market darlings than long-term investments.

March Partners, L.L.C.

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, New York-based hedge fund March
Partners, L.L.C. reported ownership of 53 companies valued at $213.0
million, an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 30 companies valued at $137.1 million.

Top sector weightings included consumer staples (19.2%), technology (16.3%),
utilities (15.7%), communication services (11.0%), and energy (10.9%).
March Partners moved into technology, consumer staples, and energy while
backing away slightly from health care, utilities, and basic materials.
While the firm increased its ownership of energy producers, recent market
darlings, the firm moved away from utilities which have fallen out of favor
in many cases as a result of California's energy woes.

The firm concentrates on event driven investing, including equity
restructurings, risk arbitrage and bankruptcies.  With respect to equity
restructurings, the firm looks for companies that are changing its assets,
capital structure and/or business in some fundamental way.  The firm's event
driven portfolio seeks securities whose values are meaningfully affected by
the occurrence of well-defined future events.  Bottom-up, fundamental
analysis focuses on each company's earnings, cash flow, relative valuations,
financial strength, proprietary products and industry niche.

Top five holdings for the quarter included: Honeywell International Inc.
[HON] with 398,300 shares (valued at $16.3 million); El Paso Corp. [EPG]
with 199,014 shares (valued at $13.0 million); Voicestream Wireless Corp.
[VSTR] with 124,199 shares (valued at $11.5 million); Alza Corp. [AZA] with
265,000 shares (valued at $10.7 million); and, Citadel Communications Corp.
[CITC] with 407,500 shares (valued at $10.1 million).

Top five new purchases included the firm's purchases in El Paso Corp., Alza
Corp., and Citadel Communications.  Rounding out the top five were Tosco
Corp. [TOS] with 225,500 shares (valued at $9.6 million), and AES Corp.
[AES] with 185,151 shares (valued at $9.3 million).  During the quarter,
many new companies found their way into the firm's portfolio.  Not
surprisingly, the firm had an average annual turnover rate of 281.2%.

Taconic Capital Advisors LLC

For the first quarter ended March 31, 2001, New York-based hedge fund
Taconic Capital Advisors LLC reported ownership of 117 companies valued at
$505.7 million, an increase from the previous quarter when the firm reported
ownership of 98 companies valued at $445.1 million.

The firm concentrates primarily on merger arbitrage across all market-caps.
Taconic moved into financials, energy, and technology while backing away
from health care and diversified.  Four of the firm's top five holdings were
new purchases.  The firm has a history of rapid portfolio turnover.  For
this most recent quarter, the firm had an annual portfolio turnover of
206.0%, similar to March Partners.

Top sector holdings included financials (22.0%), technology (18.2%), energy
(13.7%), consumer staples (10.3%), and utilities (8.8%).

Top five holdings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2001 included: Encal
Energy Ltd. [ECA] with 2,061,864 shares (valued at $15.4 million); Glaxo
SmithKline Plc - ADR with 291,445 shares (valued at $15.2 million); Xcel
Energy Inc. [XEL] with 497,027 shares (valued at $15.0 million); Washington
Mutual Inc. [WM] with 342,487 shares (valued at $12.5 million); and, Ralston
Purina Co. [RAL] with 391,520 shares (valued at $12.2 million).

K CAPITAL SELLS OUT OF DIVERSIFIED SECTOR

Boston-based hedge fund K Capital Partners, founded in 1999 by Abner Kurtin
and Thomas Knott, both formerly with Cambridge, MA-based Baupost Group,
L.L.C., manages several investment partnerships including K Capital II,
L.P., K Capital I, L.P., and K Capital Offshore Master Fund, L.P.

K Capital Partners is a value-driven firm that also involves itself with
merger arbitrage.  For value situations, the firm looks to identify a
potential catalyst for a re-rating within their investment time horizon.
Catalysts that the firm will look for include stock buy-backs, spin-offs,
restructurings or new management.

For the quarter ended March 31, 2001, the firm reported $285.6 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 26 companies.  This was an increase
from the previous quarter in which the firm reported $145.0 million in
equity assets invested in a portfolio of 15 companies.

In the fourth quarter of 2000, K Capital's portfolio was tilted in favor of
large-cap companies, which composed 65.7% of the portfolio, with mid- and
small-cap companies comprising the remainder with 8.2% and 26.1%
respectively.  In the first quarter of 2001, the portfolio was distributed
more evenly over all markets capitalizations.  Mid-cap companies garnered
the lion's share of the portfolio with 45.1%, while large- and small-caps
comprised 33.5% and 21.4% respectively.

The most heavily weighted sectors included financials (27.0%), technology
(17.8%), basic materials (10.7%), utilities (8.2%), and energy (6.7%).  From
the fourth quarter of 2000 through the first quarter of 2001, the firm sold
out of its holdings in the diversified sector, which comprised 23.0% of the
portfolio according to the 13F filed for the quarter ended December 31,
2000.

Top holdings for the quarter ended March 31, 2001 included:  KPMG Consulting
Inc. [KCIN] with 2,961,400 shares valued at $38.5 million; Allmerica
Financial Corp. [AFC] with 644,700 shares valued at $33.5 million; State
Street Corp. [STT] with 515,800 shares valued at $24.1 million; Niagara
Mohawk Holdings Inc. [NMK] with 1,380,400 shares valued at $23.3 million;
and, Chemfirst Inc. [CEM] with 833,900 shares valued at $22.2 million.  All
of the top holdings, with the exception of Chemfirst, were new purchases for

Outlooks Slip for CIENA, Vodafone, Level 3
On May 23, analysts at Morgan Stanley
downgraded the shares of this optical-networking
company, which they call ""the best-positioned company
in the sector,"" to Neutral - V from Outperform  - V.
(A ""V"" implies above-average volatility in the stock:
It has a 25% chance of moving 25% higher or lower in
a month, and is likely to become more volatile in the
next one to 12 months, compared with its performance
during the past three years.) The analysts see limited
upside from current levels for the shares, which closed

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

"","To all,

I'm coming to TX!  I wanted to get in touch with all my Texas friends (or
those near there) so if you happen to be in the area, I'd love to see you or
hear from you.

The boys and I are going to be in Houston from June 5th-25th so we can visit
family and enjoy the sunshine!  Unfortunately, Wayne just started his new
job here in Vilseck and won't be able to join us this time.

So, you can still reach Wayne in Germany.  But, I can be reached in Texas at
281-463-7843 or through this email which I will check periodically.

Hope to see you soon!

"RvIDE","Jason,
thanks for that. It seems ok at the moment. We are planning to use this for retrieving production trades (around 1000 per day). Do you know what the cause was? It would be pretty drastic if this happens in a live environment. I would like to feel confident that it will be reliable in a production environment.

Regards,
Dave Fulton

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

"news","Effective Friday the 13th of April, I will no longer be employed by Larry
R. Cook & Associates, PC.

I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowly
grinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legend
in my own mind.

I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consulting
www.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration and
compliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurance
companies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company through
financial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billable
in a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigated
matters involving securities - both for and against brokers.

MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - so
the Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!

Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,
the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  We
will remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access to
one another as this transition occurs.

For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer be
able to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect as
I will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financial
world and the information that comes with that.  However, for those of
you not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts.
 Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you on
your portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)
do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to another
broker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.
  With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.
Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at any
time.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'm
involved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to place
trades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,
etc., that's more than great!)

Most of my contact information remains the same:

home 281-362-1379
mbl 281-794-6300
internet email danaltom@hotmail.com
presumed new work email daltom@mglconsulting.com
mgl main line 281-367-0380

Dan

PS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity to
shamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened an
art gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollection.

Subject:	RAC Training

In place of tomorrow's RAC training session, we will be holding a feedback session regarding the RAC internal training program in general.  We are interested in hearing what materials each of you would be interested in learning more about and any other ideas you may have related to these sessions.  Our goal is to establish a more structured agenda and possibly course outlines or objectives for future sessions.  In establishing a more structured program, we could then apply for CPE credits and provide a calendar of future topics for all to view from the RAC website.  

Please bring your creative ideas to tomorrow's feedback session (or feel free to e-mail to me any ideas you may want to discuss at tomorrow's session):

Friday, 6/8/01
1:30 - 2:30 pm

"beach house details","Dudes-

Just wanted to get a few details out to you about the weekend of debauchery
coming up.

The address of the house is 2730 Swan Court, Surfside Beach, TX 77541

Directions:

*	Drive South on TX-288 (approx 40 miles).
*	Merge onto 332 East (you don't exit the road basically becomes
332E/288).
*	Drive through Lake Jackson about 7ish miles.
*	Take the Angelton/Surfside Exit (it is an overpass, you need to be
on it!).
*	You will drive approx. and 10 miles on 332E.
*	Turn left on Bluewater Highway (at the bottom of a bridge, if you
miss the turn you will end up in the ocean).
*	Turn Right onto Swan Ct. (approx. 3-5 miles down the road)

My cell phone is 281-787-2144, I will keep it on when I get there.

Some of us are going on Friday, I also have commitments for Sat. arrivals.
But Sat. will be the official deal, feel free to head down whenever you
would like.

Things you will need to bring:

*	Fully functional liver
*	donation towards the fee for the house (total of $625) would be
extremely appreciated, everyone could throw in some cash (checks also
accepted with 2 forms of ID)
*	Sheets/sleeping bag & pillow
*	whatever you want to eat, there is a smoker, feel free to bring
steak/chicken/fajitas
*	lawn chairs, fold up chairs
*	bug spray
*	drinking water
*	(Jason/Jeff/me) are loading up on beer, but if everybody at least
brings a 12 pack it will ensure plenty to go around
*	SPF 7000 for Sheedy
*	a giant umbrella to provide shade for MccUtcheons huge hands
*	if hatcher were coming we would need one xtra floaty for his nut
(Aaron, Graeme, these will be explained later)

I am going to bring a ton of wood to burn, horse shoes, dominoes.  But bring
whatever beach-worthy things you can think of (i.e.. footballs, frisbee's,
sailboats (Dan!!!))

I am taking Fri. off, so I am heading down midday'ish.  head down there when
you can.

ps- if you are bringing a dog, make sure to bring a crate or tie of some
sort, I would like to keep dog's in the house to a minimum, they will have a
deposit (easy Kriendler, if you have to sleep with your dog, I won't argue,
but I would like to keep the inside dog traffic to somewhat of need only
basis).  They will be keeping $$$ deposit and if the place is completely
trashed they will probably charge me.

that's all I can think for now, please forward to anyone I may have omitted.

Jeff/Jason - please forward to Dan (I don't have his new email)

see you at the beach!!

Investment ideas
-----------------------------------------

1. INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
Stimulus is the key going forward
Investors themselves, and not any single outside force, may
generate a further market rally.

By Charles Payne, founder, CEO, and principal analyst, Wall Street Strategies

With Thanksgiving smack dab in the middle of the week, it was hard determining
what the market wanted to do or where investors' heads were at. After all, the
market seemed to be running on empty until the holiday-shortened Friday
session, when the market zoomed. Of course, sticking with the engine analogy,
nay-sayers will say that the market was just rolling downhill, benefiting from an
abbreviated session that saw lighter-than-normal volume. I would agree that
Fridays session wasnt an apples-to-apples comparison with regular sessions--it
was more like running a soapbox derby racer versus an open-wheel Indy-type
car that the market typically runs during a full session. According to those folks
that dont believe in the current market rally, Fridays results were amusing and
even entertaining, but of no enduring value.

It would be easy to write the session off as a day-race that held little value in the
grand scheme of things, but that would be a big mistake. In the soapbox derby,
gravity draws the homemade racers down a modest hill. The same could have
happened to stocks on Friday. Instead stocks climbed up that same modest hill.
Stocks defied both gravity and the naysayers by trading higher and higher as the
day went on. There is a message in that achievement: I think it tells us that when
left to its own devices, the market wants to rally higher. Sure, when there are
earnings reports, economic data, brokerage downgrades, wars, unemployment,
fear, and warnings from corporate America, the race becomes akin to handling a
high-performance race car and turning corners at 180 miles an hour. It isnt as
easy as it looks.

2. INVESTMENT IDEAS
Models of success?
Surviving Internet players have better business models, but share
prices may still be too high for some.

By Dave Sterman

In a few weeks, 2001 will come to a close, putting the wraps on a forgettable year
for the Internet sector. Many firms have already headed for bankruptcy, and other
weaker players are also expected to shutter operations later in the winter.

But investors are clearly focusing on the eventual winners in the Internet space,
as share prices for healthier companies have been soaring in recent weeks. This
week, we went looking for net stocks that are still growing and appear firmly in
the ""survivor"" category.

We specifically looked for Web-oriented companies that are boosting sales at a
heady clip. As the accompanying table shows, these stocks have also seen their
shares rise sharply, leading to the question: are they still a bargain?

"Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14","Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

"Test Homes for Technology Pilot","Kriendler and Willy - 

Would you guys be willing to have your installations done for the Remote Energy Management Pilot done next week.  You would be 2 out of the 10 first test homes.  I would be coming by with the installers and possibly some media people.  You can get the royal treatment.

If so, I need to get some information:

1)  What is your address.

2)  What is your home phone number?

3)  What is your office phone?

4)  Do you have dial-up internet connection or broadband?

5)  If you have broadband, is it cable or DSL?

6)  If you have broadband, who is your provider?

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"what's up","24 April 2001

	Hey dude, what's going on?  I'm glad we got a chance to chat the
other day even if it was brief.  The Navy has really gotten even with me
ever since I got married.  Those years during flight school where I had a
bunch of time to goof off were awesome, but unfortunately over.  I guess
they wait until a pilot has all of his qualifications and then they
definitely get their money out of him.  It only makes sense.  I can't
believe I'm finally on my deployment.  This has been a cloud hanging over my
head for some time now.  I guess I'll be back soon enough.  We are in
transit steaming out to the far east and just passed the Yucatan Peninsula,
Cuba, and Jamaica.  Unfortunately, we did not get to stop in any of those
places.  These e-mails could potentially be monitored because they are sent
via satellite so I am unable to tell you where we are or where we are going,
only where we've been.  I'll keep you posted.  The conditions on this ship
are not too bad.  I've got a nice stateroom and everything I need for a
cruise.... Except the ability to get off when I want to and see my wife.  I
have not been flying too much lately, I've been standing a lot of watch
though.   I guess they are letting the newer guys get some experience.  When
you're in  the middle of the ocean standing watch at 3 am and its so dark
that you can't see anything (not that you can see anything but water anyway)
it's a pretty calming feeling.  You can see so many stars its unbelievable.
There are no city lights to drown them out and its spectacular.  We have hit
some rough seas and landing on the ship has been challenging, but good
practice.  I've been pretty busy because I just took over a new division.
I've got 60 young guys that are extremely hard workers but sometimes don't
always use the best judgment. I'm sure I'll have some interesting stories
when I get back.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hey and give you the scoop on
me.  I hope to be a little bit better about keeping in touch out here.
Please say hello to everyone for me and could you please send me Hatcher's
e-mail address.  Also, if you could do me a favor and say hey to Cassey
every once in a while, she's pretty lonely.  Until next time, Adios!!!

"Win2000 Deployment","Widows 2000 migration will begin this week with the  physical hardware scan - 4/16 to 4/17.  The migration techs will need to  check out the hardware on every machine we use.  All laptops will need to  be brought into the office no later than 4/17.
 
During the week of 4/16 everyone will need to make  themselves available for a profile interview, identifying unique application  uses and machine requirements, with a member of the migration team.  This  should only take 15 - 20 minutes.  The techs performing the interview  should contact you via email, if you wish to set an appointment just respond to  the email with the preferred date & time of your choice.  Appointments  will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis.

4/17 - We will need to identify two pilot users.  These should be the individuals within the group who use the most applications, our ""Power Users"", this will ensure that all applications are tested to their fullest extent.  

 All shared spreadsheets will need to be identified as excel seems to have caused the biggest problems in the past.

4/18 - 4/25  The Pilot process will last 5 business days, during which time the pilots are rolled completely to Windows 2000.
The pilots will use Notes R5 for two of these days and Outlook for the remaining 3 days.
Our desk bears the ultimate responsibility to ensure that ALL applications and spreadsheets used by the entire group have been tested.  This may require other members of the group to use the pilots machine to test applications or spreadsheets that are unique to your job.
ONLY THE PILOT USERS SHOULD LOG ON TO A WIN2000 MACHINE.  IF YOU ARE NOT A PILOT AND YOU LOG ON TO A WIN2000 MACHINE YOU WILL HAVE SEVERE NETWORK PROFILE ISSUES!
We will need to identify all directories and applications that we use so our support techs can arrange for the pilot user id to have access to everything the group uses.

"Texas","To all,

   Well, if you didn't already know...we didn't make it to Texas!  We were
suppose to fly out of Frankfurt, Germany on Tuesday, June 5th but Jason got
sick.

   Sunday late afternoon, Jason said his mouth hurt and we had our neighbor
who is a doctor look at his throat.  It was a little red but nothing serious
(at that point).  Nolan and I had had sore throats over the last two weeks
that lasted a few days so I figured Jason would be recovered by the time we
arrived in Houston.  Then, I stayed up until 5am Sunday night/Monday morning
doing laundry and packing.

   Monday, Jason and Nolan went to school and all seemed well while I ran
around doing last minute errands.  That evening, Wayne drove us to Wuerzburg
so that we would only be 1 1/2 hours from the airport in Frankfurt rather
than 3 1/2 hours.  The boys both seemed fine and played outside for an hour
or so when we arrived.  We were staying with friends.  During baths, Wayne
noticed a rash on Jason but didn't think anything of it.  But, as we were
putting him in bed, Jason seemed hot.  We took his temp (over 102) and gave
him motrin.  Then, since the main military hospital is in Wuerzburg, we
decided to take him in to get him started on some medicine if needed.
Before he left, we looked in his throat--this time his tonsils were almost
touching they were so big and all spotted.

   Needless to say, Wayne returned with Jason just before midnight with the
diagnosis of Scarlet Fever!  With a rash, spotted tonsils, and 103 fever, it
was an easy diagnosis.  It sounds terrible but is basically a bad case of
Strep throat accompanied by a red rash (ie where the ""scarlet"" comes from).
The doctor advised that Jason should not travel for at least 24 hours and
would not be contagious after 24-48 hours.  The doctor also said that the
incubation period was anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks.  So, Nolan and I
had both had good exposures to it since we had slept with Jason in the last
few nights as well as daily activities.

   So,not wanting to spend the entire time in Houston sick or avoiding Bob
(since he is immune suppressed due to the transplant), I tracked down my mom
and had to cancel our trip.  This occurred at about 1am Germany time--only
about 10 hours before we were suppose to fly!!!  Talk about last minute...we
were all disappointed.

   Well, we slept in Tuesday morning.  But, when Jason woke up and said,
""Mom, you know what...Today is Texas Day!!"" it brought tears to my eyes.  We
had all been so excited about going to Texas.  So, we explained to Jason
that...the plane broke and that we have to get new tickets (I didn't want
him to feel responsible).  Now, he keeps telling everyone that the plane
broke and we are going to get new tickets so we can go to Texas tomorrow!

   Jason is doing fine--you wouldn't even guess he is sick by looking at
him. Although he has been taking his medicine, it hasn't been without many
bribes.  I don't know how I am going to get him to take his medicine 4X a
day for 10 days--popsicles, ice cream, etc. eventually get old.

  We are waiting to see when/if we can fly to Texas later this summer.
However, I am hoping it is sooner than later.  Yesterday, we had to go to
the bookstore to ""get some books for Texas"" according to Jason.  I still
haven't unpacked the suitcases--it is too depressing to unpack bathing
suits, shorts, and sandals knowing I was almost there and facing the 50
degree weather here in Germany!!  People are wearing coats and turtle necks!

  I hope everyone else is doing well.  We miss you guys!  I think we might
have to go to Colter's BBQ restaraunt this weekend and listen to country
music all weekend in honor of our missed Texas trip!

Love,
Tara

He immediately notices that the man next to him also has a black eye

an outdoor/adventure outing, as well as packages in a variety of price ranges.  From Australia
to Russia to an African Safari, we will have a super line up!

Many of our remaining 2001 trips are full (which is wonderful) but we do have some openings if
you are searching for a summer or fall getaway.  The following trips have availability:

        Aegean Odyssey (June 19 - 29)
        Voyage of the Goddess (July 13 - 26)
        Norwegian Fjord (July 21 - August 3)
        NATO Trip (August 4 - 14)
        Wales (September 19 - 27)
        Rhine (October 18 - 27) * the first trip is full -- this is a new addition *

recent trips, and brochure requests.  As soon as the 2002 schedule is confirmed you will find
detailed information on those trips.

Again, I am thrilled to be a part of The Association and the Traveling Aggies.  Watch for more
information via email and the web.

"May 1st cut for Peoples Gas","Jason,
	Cora and Irene told me the Enron delivery to Peoples Gas for gas day
May 1st will be cut by 21 MMBtu.  Peoples will reduce the SIQ purchase of
125,000 by 21 leaving an SIQ amount of 124,979.

Apparently, the reduction is due to confirmation problems on Northern
Border.

If any of you can't decide by then, just buy tickets

International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale brought us live reports on Tuesday from the 115th OPEC Conference in Vienna, Austria.  Wolfgang had a live interview with OPEC President Chakib Khelil in the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.  Khelil discussed OPEC production, Western demand, and prices.  If you missed the interview, catch it in its entirety in ENL's Video Library.  We'll have more live coverage on Wednesday, and we're scheduled to have an exclusive interview with OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez.  Log on Wednesday for extensive coverage from Vienna.   The House Energy and Commerce Committee is scheduled to resume its markup of the Electricity Emergency Relief Act Wednesday morning.  Washington Bureau Chief Jay Cranford and I will be following the markup as well as the official power shift expected in the Senate tomorrow.  Also from Washington on Wednesday, Interior Secretary Gale Norton is scheduled to testify before the House Resources Committee to defend the Bush administration's national energy policy.

From the Houston bureau on Wednesday, Correspondent Kim Benestante is scheduled to bring us a report on training programs some companies are implementing to prepare high school and college students for careers in the energy industry.

Subject:	Cut on ANR to Peoples Gas Contract 104684

Jason,
	I verbally confirmed the cut that occurred for gas day May 30th with
Irene Isais of our Gas Transportation Services department.  Peoples ANR
contract 104684 was cut by 6,599 MMBtu throughout the May 30th gas day.

The supply was cut because PGL Gas Supply was not told by Enron North
America that the Northern Border supply @ Will County had been reallocated
on different contracts.  All four GISB cycles were exercised in an attempt
to receive the entire 40,000 but since the contract mismatch was not
corrected until the final cycle, Peoples lost 6,599 MMBtu for the day.

Peoples reduced its SIQ purchase from 125,000 to 118,401 for gas day May
30th.

"iBuyit Payables Is Now Available","
 

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved (again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at (713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at (713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <mailto:ibuyit@enron.com>.

"1-URGENT - Outlook Email Notification (new)","OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: April 18th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed email items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.  After you are migrated to Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.   If more than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEND E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.  Cleaning up your Notes email now will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron's messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Outlook 2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email functions. 

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

?	Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated with current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
?	More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
?	Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
?	Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

?	Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30) thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
?	All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
?	To Do Items
?	Journal Items
?	Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years in the future will be converted.
?	Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You will need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

"Cuts for Gas Days May 1 and May 2 @ Border Will County for People	s Gas","Jason,
	Peoples Gas ANR Contract 104684 was cut on gas days May 1st and 2nd
by 4 and 19 dekatherms respectively.  The 40,000 baseload volume became
39,996 for the 1st and 39,981 for the 2nd.

	The cuts were due to nomination mismatches between Northern Border
and ANR.  For example, the Enron nomination on Northern Border for contract
R0259F was 19,424 while the quantity communicated to PGL Gas Supply for that
contract was 19,405.  An attempt to restore the gas was made during the
intraday cycles but not all of the supply was confirmed.

Peoples will reduce its SIQ purchase on the 1st and 2nd by 4 and 19
dekatherms respectively.
