Joannie-

	How's it going?!  Can't remember if we've spoken since I joined
FYI-Net, but I'm part of a local multimedia and software development firm.
Many groups within Enron have used and continue to use our services.

	We have a service that we provide to EnronOnline that may interest
Investor Relations.  From time-to-time, EOL sends us a Powerpoint
presentation, a headshot of a VP, an audio file and written cues.  We
synchronize the presentation and audio, then make it available online from
the EnronOnline website.  Users don't know that they've left the EOL Web
site, we can provide the service inexpensively and we can provide a
standard, 48-hour turnaround on presentations.  Here's what the final
product looks like for EOL:

 <<...OLE_Obj...>>

	We call the product ""SlideStreamer,"" and we can present video as
well as audio - up to you.  We currently have four customers of this service
and have the system down to a routine.

	I realize that today is probably not the best time to discuss this
service, but if you are interested in the product, I would welcome the
opportunity to tell you and the IR group all about it.  You may call me at
(713) 892-8394 or reply to this message to get in touch with me.

Thanks and regards,

David M. Mims

"","Hey Buddy,
	Sorry it took me so long to write back, but it is tough to do at work and I kept putting it off.  Sorry about that, I will get better at writing back. So what is up man?  How has the sea been treating you? So what have you been doing, and what have you seen?  Around here the same ole stuff is goin on. Work, Golf and hanging out.  Thats about it.  Ferg got his new Yelliw Lab at the end of April. He named him Walter.  He's a pretty good lookin dog, but he has been cutting in to their sleep time.  Chris and Sarah had to start wearing ear plugs at night because the dog kept whining.  I thought that was pretty hilarious. Well, I finally got promoted.  I am now a full time trader. Its pretty cool, but ot can be real stressful. I'm still pretty much doing what I was before, but now I have to take full responsibility in all profits and losses.  So far its been goin Okay, but the days when you have on the wrong positions it can really suck.  Joanna's brother graduated last week from Galveston A&M.  He already got a job and started Wednesday for a shipping broker.  He is staying with us until July 1 then he is going to Paris to train for 3 months.  That should be pretty cool!  Jo is still traveling alot. She went to Toronto, Miami, London, and she is going to Berlin in June.  Wer might be going to Italy in September for our anniversary.  She is going for work and I might try to tag along. The weather has  been pretty good around here lately, all the Golf course are in great shape.  I shot a 77 the other day at FT. Bend - 41-36.  Pretty inconsistent, but I'll take it.  I bogied 18 to miss shotting 1 under.  How's Cass doing. I keep meaning to call her, but I haven't yet.  We miss seeing you guys and look forward to kicking back and drinking some beer and listening to all your stories.  I hope all is well and lookin forward to seeing you soon.  Keep our country safe, we're counting on you.  ""You and your faggoty white uniforms.""  Just kiddin -

"Re: Enron Center Garage","Please go ahead and sign me up for the new garage. - Thanks




Parking & Transportation@ENRON
03/28/2001 04:07 PM
Sent by:	DeShonda Hamilton@ENRON
To:	

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

"","Jeff,
	Sorry for all the resumes lately, but everyone wants to get their foot in the door at Enron.  This resume is from my wife's cousin, who is looking to get a summer internship at Enron.  She is a very sharp young lady with a great work ethic.  I don't know if you are hiring for internships, if not, could you please forward this on to the person hiring for those positions.  I greatly appreciate any help you could give.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks again for your help.

Hi again,

Hope your feeling better sweety. Good to hear you had a great time away.
Tan? When we were in Fiji you were trying to convince me that you had
one - baby, you have one all year round!! I love your skin.

I will probably be spending 1-2 weeks in London at this stage. We are
trying to plan the rest of our journey in Europe and I'm trying to get
four weeks off so that I can spend even more time with you.

Are both the girls still staying with you? Say hello to Jo for me. I
can't believe I haven't seen her since you left.
Have a great time going out for your B'day this weekend. It's your 30th!
But we both know you have the energy of a an 18 year old when it
counts!!

Speak to you in a couple of days.
Lisa. xx

I had a great time. The weather was macnificent. And I have a great tan.
My
brothers wedding went smoothley.
But its great news that you will be spending more time in London. How
much
time exactley? It would be a marvellous scope if you could pull off a
transfer to London as well. I am currently at the moment feeling a bit
sick
because last night I ate some dodgy food.

Jo and Nichole have settled in to London life. They are both cool. They
have both found jobs so its all going smooth.
We will all be going out this weekend for my birthday.

Love
Jason xxxxxxxxx9

pass on to ferg.

I am going at lunch to buy tickets.  I'm going to look
at the $11 - $15 range.  Let me know how many you need
before tomorrow at 10am.

If any of you can't decide by then, just buy tickets
on your own and we can all meet at cabo for a beer
before the game.

I assume no word from any of you is a 'no'.

Subject:	RAC Training

In place of tomorrow's RAC training session, we will be holding a feedback session regarding the RAC internal training program in general.  We are interested in hearing what materials each of you would be interested in learning more about and any other ideas you may have related to these sessions.  Our goal is to establish a more structured agenda and possibly course outlines or objectives for future sessions.  In establishing a more structured program, we could then apply for CPE credits and provide a calendar of future topics for all to view from the RAC website.  

Please bring your creative ideas to tomorrow's feedback session (or feel free to e-mail to me any ideas you may want to discuss at tomorrow's session):

Friday, 6/8/01
1:30 - 2:30 pm
EB5C1/2

Thank you,

Jason,

The following replied to my original e-mail:

- Ferg: Pretty sure, gotta check with my wife.
- Hatcher: I am up for playing.
- Scott: I might be.  I need to talk to Kathy about it first.
- Von: see you then
- Jason: no e-mail reply, but his assumed answer is, ""I don't reply until
the very latest possible time so that I have an opportunity to look at all
of my options and chose the one that matches my interest that particular
day, hour, or minute."" :-)  Actually, Jason told Sharon that he was in last
night, but he may change his mind after that dig.
- Mike: out
- Todd: out

We definitely have three (Von, Jason, and me).  If all of the maybes come
(Ferg, Hatcher, & Scott), we will have six.  Please confirm if you can make
it tonight.

Thanks,
- Bub

Jason, 

Effective November 1, 2001 your salary should be transferred to Hunter Shively's cost center: 107317.   I need you to enter this new cost center into your timesheet.  The way that you do this is to enter the new cost center number into the space that says Rec. CCtr for November 1 - 15th.  Also, you will need to manually enter 8 hours worked for each day so that SAP will pick up your time and expenses and put them in the new cost center.  You will also need to do the same thing for November 16 - 30th.   

Please write me back and let me know that you have received this message.  Also, please call me with any additional questions.  

Thanks for your time and assistance in this matter.

Elizabeth,
The best way to get Jason's salary transferred to the correct cost center (since it is only one pay period back), is to have him go into his SAP timesheet and have him code his time to the new cost center.  This way the system (SAP) will correct all his payroll costs automatically.  
If you need help explaining to him how to do this, let me know.
Thanks,
Brian

Hi Jason,
First of all, just want to wish you Joanna a happy thanksgiving.  We certainly have a lot to be thankful for.  Susan and I are leaving tonight visit her dad.  I'm going up to Wisconsin to visit Mimi in two weeks.  She still sound very tired.
Hear a lot of stuff about Enron.  I hope you are still doing OK.  I'm sure you've created value for yourself and should be fine.  It is just amazing to see a company that size make the mistakes that it did. But, the bottom line is that it is run by humans.  And that is how we learn.
Are you going to the game on Friday?  It would be great to see A&M pull out a win.
Love,
Dad

Subject:	Boardwalk - Credit Terms

Jai

Boardwalk have requested that we modify the CREDIT ANNEX for the financial swap.  They are requesting that the material adverse change in point (i) is changed from 4.0 to 1.0 to 5.0 to 1.0.  The rational for this request is that it would be consistent with their mortage policy.  They obtain finance from the Canadian Mortage Housing Corporation.  Boardwalk are able to borrow up to 85% of the value of the property.

""Material Adverse Change"" means (a) with respect to Counterparty, it shall have any of the following occur at any time:  (i) the ratio of its Funded Debt to Net Worth is more than 4.0 to 1.0, or (ii) its Net Worth falls below Cdn. $250 million, or (iii) the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Charges is less than 2.0 to 1.0.; or (b) with respect to ECC, Enron Corp.'s Credit Rating is below ""BBB-"" by S&P.

Secondly:
They want the ratio of EBITDA to Interest Charges changed to 1.15 to 1.0 and it to be reviewed on an annual basis.  Again to be consistent with how they run their business.  Boardwalk's current ratio is 1.97 to 1.0 so the 2.0 to 1.0 is a problem for them.

Please get back to me ASAP.

Thanks

Kate

Subject:	Highlights from ENE Analyst Conference Call 11/14

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  ""The company is overlevered; that's a fact.""--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Joe:

Two Ferrel International tickets above on Feb 1 & Feb 2 were changed in the system
to Ferrell North America by Derek Bailey.  This in incorrect.  Ferrel International is a different
corporation and the deals should stand as the trader wrote them.  New confirms in
the original name, Ferrel International, need to be resent.

This is the main reason that I have asked all your contract people to NOT change
counterparty names on my deals.  Many times, credit has incorrectly requested
counterparty name changes.  I would appreciate it if you would NOT change counterparty
on my deals.

Please let us know if you have any trouble resending these confirms.

Sony Wilson

Hi Jason, Brant,

I understand that you have been looking at Ormet Corp, and at Ormet Primary Aluminium Corp. The metals originators are thinking of a potential transaction with Ormet Corp and are asking us for information that we may have available on the companies.

Do you have any financial information on these companies? Which kind of transactions are we involved in with them?

I appreciate if you let me know

Thanks

Diana

Jason
I had to stop Boardwalk doing a financial deal today for Nov 01 - March 02.  The volume for that period is small 150,000 GJ in total but the customer is very unsophisticated.  We need to put a summary of the applicable credit provisions (as previously discussed) and contract in front of them.  As this deal is short term in nature and only in Canadian Dollars we have decided to use the Short Form Master Financial Trading Agreement.  Jason can you please help us get this done.  We initiated the process at our end on April 5.
Many thanks

Effective Friday the 13th of April, I will no longer be employed by Larry
R. Cook & Associates, PC.

I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowly
grinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legend
in my own mind.

I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consulting
www.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration and
compliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurance
companies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company through
financial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billable
in a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigated
matters involving securities - both for and against brokers.

MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - so
the Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!

Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,
the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  We
will remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access to
one another as this transition occurs.

For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer be
able to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect as
I will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financial
world and the information that comes with that.  However, for those of
you not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts.
 Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you on
your portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)
do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to another
broker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.
  With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.
Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at any
time.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'm
involved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to place
trades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,
etc., that's more than great!)

Most of my contact information remains the same:

home 281-362-1379
mbl 281-794-6300
internet email danaltom@hotmail.com
presumed new work email daltom@mglconsulting.com
mgl main line 281-367-0380

Dan

PS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity to
shamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened an
art gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollection.

I was laying low on this hoping to be forgotten.  Didn't work!!!

Top ten reasons Brian no play

10.  Greg and I are getting together a Thursday night Golden Tee league

9.  I can watch 10 assholes make fools out of themselves at Ranger games

8.  Willie drinks all of my beer while I'm batting

7.  Tired of keeping Kriendler out of fights

6.  Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica

5.  Sick of Dan trying to get me to live in some freaking compound

4.  Can find better ways to play with balls

3.  Getting married so I can't drool over (Insert your wife's name here)

2.  Trying to get into the Bunko scene

and the number one reason Brian no play....

1.  I like to have sex on Friday nights.  Too tired after Thursday 11:00
games to make a fist.

24 April 2001

	Hey dude, what's going on?  I'm glad we got a chance to chat the
other day even if it was brief.  The Navy has really gotten even with me
ever since I got married.  Those years during flight school where I had a
bunch of time to goof off were awesome, but unfortunately over.  I guess
they wait until a pilot has all of his qualifications and then they
definitely get their money out of him.  It only makes sense.  I can't
believe I'm finally on my deployment.  This has been a cloud hanging over my
head for some time now.  I guess I'll be back soon enough.  We are in
transit steaming out to the far east and just passed the Yucatan Peninsula,
Cuba, and Jamaica.  Unfortunately, we did not get to stop in any of those
places.  These e-mails could potentially be monitored because they are sent
via satellite so I am unable to tell you where we are or where we are going,
only where we've been.  I'll keep you posted.  The conditions on this ship
are not too bad.  I've got a nice stateroom and everything I need for a
cruise.... Except the ability to get off when I want to and see my wife.  I
have not been flying too much lately, I've been standing a lot of watch
though.   I guess they are letting the newer guys get some experience.  When
you're in  the middle of the ocean standing watch at 3 am and its so dark
that you can't see anything (not that you can see anything but water anyway)
it's a pretty calming feeling.  You can see so many stars its unbelievable.
There are no city lights to drown them out and its spectacular.  We have hit
some rough seas and landing on the ship has been challenging, but good
practice.  I've been pretty busy because I just took over a new division.
I've got 60 young guys that are extremely hard workers but sometimes don't
always use the best judgment. I'm sure I'll have some interesting stories
when I get back.  Anyway, I just wanted to say hey and give you the scoop on
me.  I hope to be a little bit better about keeping in touch out here.
Please say hello to everyone for me and could you please send me Hatcher's
e-mail address.  Also, if you could do me a favor and say hey to Cassey
every once in a while, she's pretty lonely.  Until next time, Adios!!!

Lisa - here are the deal I was telling you about.

Jay - I tried pulling the confirms up on both of these deals this morning in DCAF, and I get a message saying there was no confirm.  The notes to both deals state that you are working on the confirm.  Have these deals been confirmed yet?  Also, if they have, can you get me a copy?  If they could be faxed to 713-646-8420 it would be great.

I addition, on a regular basis, Lisa Valderrama and Pam Boxx need to be copied on any Emails like this.  That way if one of us is out of the office, the others will be able to make sure the invoice/payments take place on time.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Subject:	Highlights from this morning's ENE/DYN analyst conference call

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a ""new approach"", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

"","Thanks for your help on all my stuff.  Everything should be set up just like April 11.  Its in the system as Max SIQ for both companies, and the 10301 DIQ for Peoples only, No DIQ for NS.  This could change slightly in the morning, but my guess is it won't.  I already balanced out Will Co and Other City gates and took 72000 to Peoples.  Kelly needs to buy at least the short at amarillo.  Thanks again and I'll check with you in the morning to make sure everything is ok.  I'll have my pager if there is a major crisis, I dont anticipate one though.

Gentlemen,
	I understand that the policy is to call a customer for a line of credit when it is warranted.  I would request that we review Frontier's Credit line and I believe that we should be able to increase this line significantly.  US refining margins are at record highs, US refinery earnings are at record highs (See Valero's, Tosco's), and Frontier is a very significant and loyal Enron customer.   They are releasing 1st Quarter earnings on the 27th of this month and should be in-line with the earnings of the other independent refiners.  Could you please review this status and issue a new credit line, so we can continue to build both Gas and Global Markets business with this customer.   Thanks


Mark

I am going to paper this transaction today and I wanted to be clear that Credit is completely on board.

Velsicol's current booked transaction is 310 mmbtu per day at 140% of IF-HSC through January 31, 2005.

I am going to book 310 mmbtu per day at $5.25 from June through December 2001 and 
					at IF-HSC  plus $1.50 from January 2002 through January 2005
				
I am then going to extend the end date until January 2008 with the same volume @ IF-HSC plus $1.50.

I believe Tanya and Jason both have given me approval in April but I wanted to verify one last time prior to booking.

Thanks,

Gary
