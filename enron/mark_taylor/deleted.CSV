"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Mark - Louise Kitchen put your name down as the sponsor for all EA IT legal projects.  All EA IT projects were reviewed & approved Tues. & Wed. by the sponsors except the 2 that had your name by them.   Cornelio and I tried to catch you Tues. & Wed. via phone calls & emails to review them with you, but with no luck. Louise is reviewing the final EA IT budget today.

I apologize for you being put into the middle of all this by Louise, but I wanted to give you all the information that I could about the projects before Louise reviews them today.  Thanks for your help.

Subject:	RE: 2002 IT Budgets

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

[IMAGE]   2nd Circuit Overturns Sanctions Against Out-of-State Lawyers  New York Law Journal Finding that lawyers sanctioned by a federal judge were never given a chance to defend themselves, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a $10,000 assessment and restored the pro hac vice status of two Florida attorneys. Judge Constance Baker Motley of the Southern District of New York failed to follow the procedures required for imposing sanctions in the case stemming from a sexual harassment suit against Smith Barney Inc.   Full Text    Judge Finds Contents of Gallup Employee Survey Legally Protectable  The Legal Intelligencer Gallup Inc., the Princeton, N.J.-based consulting firm, won a significant victory in its copyright suit against Wayne, Pa.-based competitor Kenexa when a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled that the contents of Gallup's employee satisfaction survey are legally protectable. However, the judge still found factual disputes in the suit, which claimed Kenexa misappropriated the contents of Gallup's survey and ""raided"" its employees. Full Text    Census Case Brings Family Reunion at U.S. Supreme Court  American Lawyer Media Brothers Michael and Thomas Lee are drawing extensively from the expertise of their late father, former Solicitor General Rex Lee, as they prepare for their first case at the U.S. Supreme Court. The attorneys are working on the state of Utah's claim that the 2000 census' failure to count Mormon missionaries overseas, leaving the state shy of gaining a congressional seat, was an equal protection violation.  Full Text     Portland Police Refuse to Cooperate With Federal Terrorism Questioning, Cite Oregon Law  The Associated Press Portland, Ore., police have refused a U.S. Department of Justice request for help in interviewing Middle Eastern immigrants as part of its sweeping terrorism investigation, saying it would violate a state law that says no one can be questioned by police unless they are suspected of being involved in a crime. Portland is believed to be the first city to refuse to cooperate with the DOJ in its anti-terrorism effort.

Ken,

I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.

Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/sci/tech/newsid_1569000/1569222.stm

Sorry to have troubled you, but I KNOW that if I mention it, then you will get it to the right person for consideration.

Many thanks

Andrew Henderson

Tax:  I am providing you a copy as a heads up in respect of consideration of Canada tax issues.  Stephen, these issues were previously developed when we closed the PGE master.  Can you provide to me a short memo describing the resolution of the issues (my recollection is that resolution resulted in a post agreement tax letter agreement to be devised by you and tax counsel at Blakes.)

Accounting:  Information purposes.

Joel:  Financing issues.

Others:  Please review and comment on what is hopefully close to a final draft.

expand the geographical location in which Exchange Licensed Depositories for

The proposed amendments must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (""CFTC"").  The Exchange membership will be notified upon receipt
of CFTC approval and the effective date of the amendments.

Due to the unprecedent events of September 11, 2001 NG Risk Desks have requested that Exchange and Options prices for the September 10, 2001 be copied for 
Tuesday, September 11, 2001. There were a few trade prices posted in ERMS prior to the closing of the Market on yesterday. Those prices were futures prices only, and 
were not changed. There were no options prices for the 11th and therefore the 10th prices for options were copied for the 11th. Francis Lim (manager, ERMS IT) made 
these changes per my request. It is my understanding that if exchange and options prices are not available from the Market today, September 12, 2001, Enron traders will  
provide rates to be posted to the various commodities Risk Desks. If there are any changes in these instructions, please contact me @ 3-9226 or Francis Lim @ 3-5906.

Thanks,  wlh

Subject:	RE: Weather

I am in Houston office Thursday 13 and the morning of Friday 14 Sept if it would help to meet up and discuss further.

Diagram follows. Prior to (I think)  August 20 ECTRIC was the principal to the European trades not effected by Oslo (transactions all arranged by EEFT for regulatory purposes), and post August 20 the principal to the European trades effected out of London is EFET LLC (again arranged by EEFT for regulatory purposes). Just by way of background EFET LLC will be the principal for all financial trades done out of London (i.e will contract coal, power, gas financials and not just weather, so there should be some reduction in the number of ISDAs to be put in place).

"SEC Investigation","Mark,

SEC has asked for information in regards with Faslow's partnership.  This is not good news overall.  The potential risk is high.  However, it is being discounted in the stock already.  We will see what occurs from this.  The stock is very oversold.  However, the timetable of a bounce is questionable.

"Migration of Clickpaper Application to EOL (Obligations to","Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.  

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder

Robbie - here is the contract with Ariba we were discussing yesterday.  Just want to get legal coverage of a couple of issues regarding how we should proceed once we stop using Ariba for clickpaper.com.

- we will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  do we need to notify them?
- i will send them the final accounting of transactions cleared through the ariba software at the end of 3rd quarter (they invoice us for a small fee for each transaction.)  I assume no further communication with Ariba will be required on my part.
- need to determine if we need to take any steps for contract termination, or simply let the arrangement expire next spring.  presumably we do not want to renew, nor do we want to terminate early on the small chance someone might want to use the licenses in the meantime.
 
Please let me know what questions you have...

thanks
KNC

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

"RE: Food","Mark,

As you can guess, I'm really looking forward to seeing you.  There are a
number of lunch places on the intercoastal waterway nearby the boat show
where we can eat and watch the boats go by, I'm not sure how great their
food is though, or we could go to the place you like on the beach with the
swings.  It is also close to the boat show.  We have dinner reservations for
Mark's at 9 p.m. on Saturday evening.  I guess we should play the other
day's lunch by ear, but I'm sure we could get in to whatever restaurant you
would like.  I've seen Barnaby's like brunch places, but nothing really
neat.  There is one hotel in Ft. Lauderdale on the same street Mark's is on
that might have a good Sunday brunch.  I'm not sure what else you would like
to do, but here are some suggestions.  If you want to have a late night on
Friday, we could drive down to South Beach.  I'm fairly sure they serve
dinner late, perhaps that Sushi bar in the Delano or the restaurant in the
Delano.  In fact, if you would like to stay Friday night at a hotel on South
Beach, I will pay for it.  If this doesn't sound good, there are some places
on the street Mark's is on may still serve dinner at that time, if not, I
can make something at home.  Also, if having coffee and reading the Sunday
paper on the lawn at the Breakers while they pipe in classical music sound
fun, we could do that Sunday morning.  However, it's one hour's drive each
way.  There is also a great movie theater in Ft. Lauderdale and we could go
on one of those power boats that cruises the intercoastal waterway.  I'll
leave the whole weekend up to you.  Looking forward to seeing you.

Ted

I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.
Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the
water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to
the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather
do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday
brunch places?

   Mark,

   I think we should plan on something more casual for Friday evening.
   Since
   you are the foodie, please let me know which restaurant you would like
   to
   have dinner at on Saturday evening and I'll make reservations today.
   Also,
   please let me know if there is another restaurant you would like to have
   lunch at and I can make that reservation as well.

   looking forward to seeing you!

   My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
   what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
   Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
   that looked interesting:


   Bistro Mezzaluna
   Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
   Left Bank
   Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
   Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

   Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
   airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
   two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
   see what you think.

"FW: European Products","Mark - How would we structure transactions in UK gas, UK weather, Brent and metals with the various hedge funds run out of New York?  Is there a way to back-to-back them with our London office through their existing ISDAs or would they have to enter into new ISDA agreements with ECTRIC?  Any thoughts you have on this matter would be well received in these quarters.  Thanks.  Frank

Susan-
As a follow-up on our earlier conversation, the list of European Products which our Hedge Fund Counterparties will probably have/ currently have interest  in trading with Enron are:

UK Gas
UK Weather
Brent
Metals

It is my understanding that the above products are booked under various Enron entities - ie Enron Europe, Enron Global Markets and Enron Liquids & Fuel Inc (ELFI)

Could you pls let us know if we will run into tax problems if: we book all financial transactions between ENA and our counterparties and then 
do an Internal transaction between ENA and the above entities to move the risk to the appropriate book.

Thanks for your help

Beat regards,

Mark asked me to take a look over the attached, which I am more than happy to do.  I has a few questions in relation to the product.

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
that looked interesting:


Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
see what you think.

Air Quality Update
 
 
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been  and will continue to be the first priority for the management of this  exchange.  The Exchange has engaged  Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent laboratory specializing  in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality including tests for  transmission electron microscopy (TEM), polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons,  Acenaphthene, Acenaphthylene, Anthracene, Benz (a) anthracene, Benzo (a) pyrene,  Benzo (b) fluorathene, Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene,  Dibenz (a,h) anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene,  Napthalene, Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead,  Manganese, Nickel, Silica, and Zinc.   Air quality tests were performed on September 14th, 20  th, 26 th, October 4 th, 9 th, 12  th, 16 th, 18 th, 23 rd, and  26th, and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA, OSHA,  ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.
 
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on  testing for dangerous chemicals outside the building, as a result of the tragic  events that have occurred in the past six weeks.  Ambient Group, Inc. has secured a  high-volume air sampling monitor (one of only four available to commercial  buildings in New York City) that tests for Benzene, Dioxin, P.C.B.s, as well a  large variety of other air borne chemicals and is based on EPA guidelines.  The Exchange has been testing for these  chemicals for the past few weeks and the first results will be available by next  week.  
 
Going forward, all test results will be posted and made  available to all building occupants on a weekly  basis.
 
Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to  contact Elliot Zuckerman, property manager, at (212)  299-2242.

"(01-391) Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants","Notice Number: 01-391
November 21, 2001

TO:
ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
Emergency Rules - ScotiaMocatta Warrants


As a result of the attack on the World Trade Center and the inaccessibility
of the precious metals stored at ScotiaMocatta Depository (""SMD""), an
Exchange Licensed Depository, located in Four World Trade Center (""4WTC""),
the NYMEX Board of Directors implemented emergency rules pertaining to the
warrants issued by SMD.  In summary, these emergency rules permitted an
individual or firm taking delivery the option to reject a warrant for metal
on deposit at the SMD vault at 4WTC.

SMD has successfully relocated, using an Exchange Approved Carrier, all of
the precious metals stored at 4WTC to an SMD custodial account at the
Brink's Inc Exchange Licensed Depository and has applied to the Exchange to
establish a new Licensed Depository in New York City.

Therefore, the Exchange has, effectively immediately, rescinded the
emergency rules pertaining to the warrants issued by SMD.  As a result, the
Exchange Rules relating to warrants are those which were in effect prior to
the declaration of the emergency.

Prior to the establishment of its new facility as an Exchange-licensed
depository, SMD will offer its clients the options of leaving the metal in
storage; selling it to SMD; exchanging depository receipts for those of
another Exchange-licensed depository acceptable to ScotiaMocatta, with any
ounce differential cash-settled on the basis of a published price determined
by SMD; or delivering replacement metal to a mutually agreeable location, in
exchange for the metal at the ScotiaMocatta depository, subject to payment
by the client of the current price differential, as quoted by SMD.

Should you have any questions please contact Thomas LaSala at 212-299-2897,
Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Nick Galati at 212-299-2920.

From: 	Musch, Susan  
Sent:	Tuesday, October 23, 2001 1:39 PM
To:	Sayre, Frank
Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA
Importance:	High

Frank,

FYI, attached is an e-mail from Janine Juggins who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept.  I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side.  She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date.  Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November.  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon.

After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA).  This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions.  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn.  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions?  Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts.  Were you aware of this?

I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

Best regards,
Susan

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Are multiparty ISDAs a real option ? This seems like the simplest solution.

If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.

With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).

Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.

To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost). 

Regards
Janine

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Regards
Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

[IMAGE]   Anthrax: What's the Cost to Cure?  law.com As public fear of bioterrorism spreads, concern about the availability of vaccines and antibiotics runs high. And so does the volume of litigation. Bayer, the manufacturer of the anti-anthrax antibiotic Cipro, is implicated in a number of antitrust suits, and BioPort, the maker of the anthrax vaccine, is accused of producing an unsafe and ineffective product ... which also happens to be mandatorily administered by the U.S. military.   Full Text     Judge Wants 'Hopwood' Law School Saga to End  Texas Lawyer The University of Texas may have to pay $1 million in attorneys' fees to lawyers representing the plaintiffs in the long-running Hopwood suit, which led to an end of the law school's use of racial preferences in admissions. U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks' order said, ""In the end, the taxpayers of Texas are one million dollars poorer ... and nothing has changed for the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit way back in 1992.""  Full Text     Pennsylvania Court OKs Dismissal of $21 Million Judgment in Insurance Case  The Legal Intelligencer The Pennsylvania Superior Court did not err when it overturned a $21 million judgment and set new standards for interpreting the known-loss doctrine in insurance cases, a divided state supreme court has ruled. Chief Justice John P. Flaherty said that while the known-loss doctrine has not been formally adopted in Pennsylvania, the court has long required insurance applicants to disclose information material to insurable risk.  Full Text    Delaware High Court Rules for Corporate Directors  The National Law Journal The Delaware Supreme Court has issued opinions in two shareholder cases that experts say bolster the ability of responsible corporate directors to make decisions regarding their businesses without fear of being second-guessed by the courts. The court en banc affirmed judgments to dismiss shareholder suits on the pleadings, saying neither met threshold provisions necessary to move to discovery and trial. Full Text    Get Out of Town, Stay Out of Jail: In Georgia, Banishment Substitutes for Prison  The Associated Press Some of those on Georgia prosecutor Kelly Burke's list of 62 criminals have served jail time. Many have not. But he proudly puts them all under one heading: ""BANNED."" Legalized exile is largely considered an anachronism, a pseudo-solution that merely makes one jurisdiction's convict somebody else's problem. Still, banishment persists in Georgia and Kentucky and possibly other states -- legal scholars don't keep track. Full Text     New York Strip Search Policy Ruled Unconstitutional  New York Law Journal Strip searches of detainees held on misdemeanor charges must still be based on a ""reasonable suspicion"" the person has a weapon or other contraband, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled. The court said the search standard for a detainee in jail remains more exacting than that for cavity searches in prison. The ruling affirms that the strip search policy at a Nassau County correctional facility in New York was unconstitutional. Full Text    ADVERTISEMENT  Find out what we know about your future!

THE AFFILIATES - North America's Legal Staffing Specialist.   Pittsburgh Firms Attracting More Students From Across U.S.  The Legal Intelligencer Although Pittsburgh houses law firms with international recognition, it has never ranked with cities like New York or Boston in attracting talent from across the country. Many Pittsburgh lawyers are natives of the region or attended one of the city's two law schools. But a survey of first-year associates shows that the number of out-of-town lawyers going for jobs with Pittsburgh firms may be increasing. Full Text    [IMAGE]   The Legal Challenges of Canning Spam  The Recorder They've been sued, outlawed and blacklisted. But spammers continue to thrive. Part of the reason, attorneys and consumer advocates say, is that efforts to block unsolicited bulk e-mail have been too broad, shutting out legitimate messages as well. Blacklisting of spammers and legislative measures to curb spamming have led to a spate of litigation. Experian eMarketing Inc.'s legal battle highlights the problem.

Professional Schizophrenia  Miami Daily Business Review The American Bar Association and every state bar, except the District of Columbia, have strict rules against multidisciplinary practice, or MDP, whereby lawyers and nonlawyers partner and split fees for providing legal services. Even so, in the last few years the Big Five accounting firms have stepped up their hiring of lawyers, and the difference between what lawyers and accounting firm consultants do has become very murky. Full Text     Business Casual Backlash  Texas Lawyer The business casual backlash, it seems, has begun. No, there has not been any across-the-board rescinding of the business casual policies that in recent years have taken over the workplace. Dressing like a Gap ad was OK during boom times -- but with major firms telling workers to watch out, lest they find themselves back in pantyhose and pinstripes, ""biz cas"" may wind up as just another casualty of the down economy.

Subject:	No Confirms for EnronOnline deals

Hi Mark,

I don't think we have ever met but I have taken over Dave Forsters responsibilities at EnronOnline. We just learnt from Leslie Hansen ( who heard from Reliant) that we have sent out letters and contracts to our top  customers about not sending written confirms for deals done on EnronOnline. While I was aware that we were working on trying to eliminate written confirmations this is the first I am hearing about letters sent to our customers. I would appreciate being kept in the loop on these matters so we are ready to respond in case of customer calls.

Ike Hilliard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Hilliard continues to feel some soreness in his surgically-repaired toe, and it is causing him to limp around a bit. He is still expected to start in Monday's game against Minnesota, but playing on the artificial turf can't be good for his injury. 

Reggie Kelly <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=! 74! 388.6&random=679&key=133334&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
According to published reports, Kelly (knee/ankle) should be able to return to action this weekend against Carolina. He won't make much of a Fantasy impact, however, so don't bother starting him in Week 11. 

Chad Lewis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/19/01
Lewis suffered a slight knee injury during Sunday's 36-3 win over Dallas. The injury isn't considered serious, however, and Lewis is expected to start this weekend's game against Washington. 

Steve M! cN! air <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&> , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Packers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=11&>, DT GB - Manchester United Updated 11/19/01
Safety LeRoy Butler suffered a fractured left shoulder blade during Sunday's game against Atlanta. He is out indefinitely and could miss the remainder of the season. Chris Akins will likely take over the starting duties in Butler's absence. 

Steve McNair <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1069&>, QB! T! EN - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
McNair was able to play with an injury to his right thumb, but the Tennessean says he will probably miss some practice time this week. He should still be able to play in the team's next game.

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12411&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Hakim left Sunday's game against New England with an ankle injury. X-rays were negative, and Hakim is listed as day to day. 

Reggie Wayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Wayne suffered a sprained knee on Sunday. His current status is day to day.

Rod Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1220&>, WR DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/19/01
Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thursday's game against Dallas is unclear.

Terance Mathis <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in the game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina. 

Jackie Harris <http://football434! .f! antasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1368&>, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Harris suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day. 

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Sanders had a huge game against Detroit on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day. 

Quincy Carter!  <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235201&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Carter feels as though his hamstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, the Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this season to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/19/01
Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-Dealer it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson had been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had indicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benjamin Gay, Jackson's Fantas! y ! value might drop greatly.

Ryan Leaf <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Leaf had another terrible outing this weekend, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's starting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver wire fodder in Fantasy Football. 

Kevin Lockett <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1765&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarter due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia is uncertain at this time. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver, told the Washington Post that there's a ""definite possibility"" he would be ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham would start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fantasy option against the Eagles. 

Emmitt Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/19/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee. However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when D! al! las faces Denver on Thanksgiving Day. 

Larry Foster <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.

Desmond Howard <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1268&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win over Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1186&> , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01
Emanuel suffered a knee injury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01
Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried th! e ! ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan,! w! ho always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=679&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

"Good news!","There's good news from this Tuesday--yesterday.  Dad passed his medical
exam for his pilot's license!  We went out and celebrated last night.  It
was nip and tuck on the eye test, that was the one he was worried about,
but he passed!

If you have time--in today's Wall Street Journal there are some
interesting articles, especially the first one below:

Page A20 - ""How Did Afghans Become Bad Guys?""

Page A22 - Capital Journal - ""After the Terror, God Reappears in Public
Life""

Page B1 - ""In Cataclysmic Times, Workers Need Room to Rethink Priorities""

Thank you for letting us know that you are home.  We are glad too!

"(01-395) Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day","Notice No. 01-395
November 27, 2001

TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day

Please be reminded that Friday, November 30, 2001, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of December
2001 (the new spot month).

On Thursday, November 29, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
(""OLTE"") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.

[IMAGE]   House Prepares to Move Anti-Terrorism Compromise  The Associated Press Police would be able to secretly search the homes of suspects, tap their phones and track their Internet use under anti-terrorism legislation moving toward final approval in the U.S. House of Representatives. House leaders said the final bill will be voted on today, with Senate approval expected later this week. But the bill may hit a snag on the Senate side as lawmakers tinker with an ethics amendment applying to federal prosecutors.   Full Text     New York Federal Judge Slams Attorney's Tactics in Surety Bond Dispute as 'Sleazy'  New York Law Journal An attorney in a dispute over a surety bond has been hit with sanctions after raising the ire of a federal judge in New York. It was not just that Alfred Ferrer III filed an unwarranted order to show cause, but when he filed it. ""Dante should have reserved a special place in hell for lawyers who file unwarranted orders to show cause on the eve of a holiday,"" said U.S. District Judge John Martin of the Dec. 23, 1999, filing.  Full Text     Trial Opens in California E-Mail Threat Case  The Recorder A Santa Clara County, Calif., prosecutor, undaunted by one judge's rejection of his Internet stalking case, set out Monday to convince a jury that a Fremont, Calif., man was tormenting a Michigan couple from half a continent away. The case is part of an effort by Santa Clara's High-Tech Crime Unit to crack down on crimes committed under cover of Internet anonymity. But the prosecutors may find it a tough sell.  Full Text    Tosco Settles Over Refinery Explosion  The Recorder Tosco Corp. has settled what could have been a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by relatives of one employee who was killed and another worker who was seriously injured during an explosion at Tosco's California refinery two years ago. Steven Duncan and the family of Ernest Pofahl will be able to collect workers' compensation in addition to the settlement award. Tosco was acquired by Phillips Petroleum last month. Full Text    Employee Awarded $150,000 After Co-Worker Falsely Accuses Him of Rape  The Legal Intelligencer In a case that turned the tables on sexual harassment, a Philadelphia jury awarded $150,000 to a man who said his employer invaded his privacy by subjecting him to an embarrassing, police-style interrogation after he had an innocent, romantic tryst with a female co-worker that she had reported to management as a rape. The jury also found the woman had defamed the man by making false accusations. Full Text     For Troubled Teen, There's No Escape  Legal Times He's the product of three generations of retardation, mental illness, and physical and sexual abuse. According to prosecutors, the teen-age boy is also a dangerous criminal. A recently released opinion from a Washington, D.C., Superior Court judge about the boy offers a seldom-seen view into a high-profile juvenile case, and the unsettling history of the defendant's childhood and ascent to violent crime.

IPO Suits Put Dot-Coms in Dual -- and Conflicting -- Roles  The Recorder A class action filed by Mortgage.com against Credit Suisse First Boston alleges that Mortgage.com was cheated out of proceeds from its initial public offering. The suit seeks relief for all companies that Credit Suisse took public, putting scores of dot-coms in the position of being both defendants and potential plaintiffs in the hundreds of related cases before U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in New York. Full Text    [IMAGE]   A Matter of Faith  Corporate Counsel After September's terrorist attacks, travel giant Cendant Corp. saw its stock plunge. Just as he did in 1998 when Cendant was embroiled in one of the biggest back-office frauds in U.S. history, general counsel James Buckman turned to his religious faith for support. For Buckman -- a devout Catholic and committed capitalist -- saving Cendant is a moral obligation.  Visit In-House Counsel    ADVERTISEMENT  FREE  Acrobat Legal Solutions CD!

Sick Building Woes  The National Law Journal A former partner in the Denver office of Los Angeles' Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher who gave up her practice in 1995 because she became sick when exposed to the firm's office building has won a $1 million verdict against a disability insurer that denied her claim. Finding the insurer's denial of benefits arbitrary and capricious, a federal judge said the insurer disregarded key evidence supporting Pamela Ray's claim. Full Text     Pass/Fail  Delaware Law Weekly Jeffrey R. Waxman, a recent hire at Wilmington, Del.'s Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling, managed to experience the anguish of failing the Delaware bar examination and the euphoria of passing it -- all within two days. Waxman had his results checked via the wrong secret number, and found he'd failed. But when the results were listed by name, he was on the pass list. Nerve-wracking, to be sure -- but all's well that ends well. Full Text    [IMAGE]   'Initial Interest' Confusion Actionable in Trademark Case  The Legal Intelligencer For the first time, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that ""initial interest"" confusion is actionable in a trademark infringement suit. However, victory on that legal issue was not enough for Checkpoint Systems, a marketer of shoplifter security systems, because the court went on to find that the minimal evidence of initial interest confusion was not enough to establish any ""likelihood of confusion.""

"FW: Thanksgiving","
Today is CFO's Day.  A uniquely American concept, it is one that I personally value the most.  It has no business justification, and is not tied to any shareholder value.  It does not spring from common sense and carries with it very little baggage.  No value is received by the company; disclosures are few and spare; it reminds us that for senior management, there is little commercial incentive not  to buy, travel, celebrate, or do anything to excess.  (The possible exceptions are the temptations to perform rationally or honestly.)

CFO Day is a day specifically set aside to ponder our good fortune.  As most of you know, it was first held in New England - a bountiful feast during which the American forefathers stole money, land and resources from Native Americans, appropriating their good harvest for their own ends.  Senior Management celebrates this day still, to  remind us of the values which we must try to make our own.

This is a very difficult time for all you left at Enron.  I want to take a few minutes of your time to share with you some of my thoughts - for even now, it is important to count our blessings and recall some of the many things for which we can be thankful.  I am thankful for the way all of you have selflessly contributed to my retirement fund.  I am moved by the dollars many of you have shared with me.  I have been impressed by your willingness to look forward, stay the course, ignore GAAP requirements, and maintain your stock purchase payments.  Your loyalty and naivety have sustained me during some of my darkest moments.  I am grateful for friends, family, and the opportunity to live and work in a free and open society, whereas by rights I should be living and working in an open prison.  Mostly, I am so very proud of you - your talents, your flexibility, your work ethic, your willingness to hang in there when things seemed to be spinning out of control.

Thanks for constantly reminding me how lucky I was to be working with such suckers.  

Andy Fastow

Robie, when you find the details about the second operating brand covered by the Ariba Contract (namely, Enrondirectfinance.com) and how important it is to Enron to reserve the right to use the Ariba Services for another Enron market, please call.

As we discussed, I have attached my recommendations with respect to the Ariba Contract ""termination"" and the contractual basis therefore.

I will be glad either to draft any correspondence, or review any correspondence you prepare in connection with the Ariba matter.

I look forward to working with you on this matter and having an opportunity to meet you.

[IMAGE]   3rd Circuit Shoots Down Gun Suit Theory  The Legal Intelligencer In a major victory for gun manufacturers, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Friday the dismissal of a suit brought by Camden County, N.J., that accused gun makers of creating a ""public nuisance"" and sought to recoup the governmental costs associated with gun-related crimes. Attorneys argued that the manufacturers contributed to the widespread criminal use of handguns in the county.   Full Text    DuPont Plaintiff's Fight With Ex-Attorneys Goes Federal  Miami Daily Business Review After failing to get a state judge to hear his case, a Florida nurseryman has turned to the U.S. District Court in Miami. Dale Smith says his former attorneys intentionally concealed from him the details of a settlement agreement they reached with DuPont in a claim that alleged the company sold Smith and others a fungicide, Benlate, that wiped out their crops. Smith had refused the settlement, but then lost in a jury trial. Full Text    Lawyer's Defamation Claim Against ABA Found Valid  The Legal Intelligencer Attorney Richard Sprague has cleared a major hurdle in his defamation lawsuit against the American Bar Association and its magazine, the ABA Journal, now that a Pennsylvania federal judge has ruled that readers could have attached defamatory meaning to the magazine's labeling Sprague a ""fixer."" Although the ABA argued that the description was intended as a compliment, the judge found the term also has a negative meaning.  Full Text     Georgia Appeals Panel Reviews Rabbinical Court Ruling  Fulton County Daily Report A Georgia talent agent has asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to reverse a ruling that an ancient rabbinical legal proceeding, a bet din, didn't follow state law. The lower court found that a bet din is a legitimate means of arbitration as long as it complies with Georgia law, but that, because there were no records kept, the proceeding used to resolve the agent's dispute with his client violated the client's rights.  Full Text    Justice Rejects Microsoft Penalty  The Associated Press The Justice Department considered but rejected penalties against Microsoft in its antitrust case that would have forced the company to reveal the secret blueprints to its Windows software and to distribute products from its fiercest rivals, court records show. Critics have said the government's settlement is inadequate and that Microsoft will be able to bypass many of the agreement's sanctions because of vague language.

Tentative Settlement Terms Reached in Ford Bias Suits  The Associated Press Following a marathon negotiating session, Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. has reached tentative settlement terms in age- and gender-bias claims brought by current and former employees in two class actions. Negotiations over seven individual suits, which claim the company's evaluation system favored younger, so-called diversity candidates, are scheduled to begin in earnest this week. Full Text    [IMAGE]  Advice for In-House Counsel: Deleting Computer Chaos    Corporate Counsel Nothing concentrates the mind like disaster, and the attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., prompted information technology types and their corporate overseers to review their recovery plans. Shockingly, some had none. Others weathered the crisis pretty well and managed to get up and running quickly. So what's the lesson? Mobility and redundancy are good. Centralization isn't.

Visit Automated Lawyer Tech News   The Five Myths of Case Management  American Lawyer Media Case management systems have long held the promise of being the best thing since word processing and e-mail. But if that's so, why doesn't everyone use them -- and use them successfully? Lawyers have high expectations of case management programs, but these expectations are often too high. Let's explore five myths of case management.  Visit Automated Lawyer Tips and Reviews   [IMAGE]   Historic High Court Ruling Is Troublesome Model for Modern Terror Trials  American Lawyer Media In 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt authorized the creation of a military commission to try German saboteurs arrested in the U.S. The Supreme Court decision upholding the tribunal provides strong authority for President Bush's order authorizing military commissions as a way to bring the Sept. 11 terrorists to justice. But to some, the decision demonstrates that wartime justice can be too hasty to withstand the test of time.

"RE: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","Nora:
 
My first thoughts are to review the Solar Noncompetition Agreement (noncompete regarding the manufacture of photovoltaic cells in connection with the sale of Enron's 50% interest in the Amoco/Enron Solar Partnership to BP Amoco), the NewPower Noncompetition Agreement and the ServiceCo Noncompetition Agreement (EES new facility services venture).  My recollection is that the NewPower Noncompete and the ServiceCo Noncompete allow defeasance of the noncompetition provisions by permitting the investors to have put rights at fair market value (in other words, the noncompete provisions will bind a successor unless the investor honors the put rights).  It has been some time since I reviewed the Solar Noncompete, but I believe it could bind a successor if a third party merged or consolidated with Enron Corp., as opposed to a stock or asset purchase.  I also need to check the expiry date of this agreement, as it may be close to expiration.
 
Regards,
Robert

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Muhammad sprained his left shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 game against Atlanta is unclear.

Mike Anderson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/18/01! Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redskins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10 times for 28 yards. It is apparent Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary will continue to see some work at his expense.

Michael Westbrook <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards and a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, and Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18! /0! 1
Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TDs and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare for Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.

Michael Pittman <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman to 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks unless your team is very thin at RB..

David Sloan <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1331&>, TE DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Arizona. If you ! ar! e desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan, who always gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.

Lamont Warren <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1112&>, RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature Warren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.

Warrick Dunn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1171&>, RB TB - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consistently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive, but he is also erratic.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1265&>, WR TB - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/18/01
Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed to get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unless your team is very thin at wideout.

David Terrell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Terrell ca! ug! ht one pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The rookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.

Marty Booker <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133228&>, WR CHI - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/18/01
Booker caught seven passes for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week, no matter what matchup he faces. 

Plaxico Burress <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=187385&>, WR PIT - Bees Updated 11/18/01
The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy player.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235249&>, RB SD - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Tomlinson put up decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may have something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason. 

Hines Ward <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Ward caught nine passes for 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often, Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he will always post respectable totals.

Doug Flutie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12375&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for only 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is becoming somewhat of a gamble. 

Stacey Mack <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He has not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season.

Rich Gannon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/18/01
Gannon had a solid outing against San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of the top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every week. 

Jerry Rice <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1291&>, WR OAK - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Rice had a huge game on Sunday, catching eight passes for 131 yards and three touchdowns against San Diego. R! ic! e may not be an every-week starter in smaller leagues, but he can certainly still put up huge Fantasy numbers when the matchup is right. 

Tony Banks <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Banks was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday's game at Denver with a concussion. He was replaced by Kent Graham.

Brett Favre <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1028&>, QB GB - Team Sensitive Updated 11/18/01
Favre threw for 262 yards and two TDs against the Falcons, but he was intercepted three times and lost a fumble. Despite some inconsistent play in recent weeks, Favre's potential for big games makes him a must-start every week.

Corey Bradford <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Bradford caught three passes for 117 yards against Atlanta. The Green Bay wideout is still too inconsistent to be considered a solid Fantasy player.

Chris Chandler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Chandler started at Green Bay, and threw for 352 yards, two TD! s ! and two interceptions. He remains a good Fantasy backup when healthy.

Bob Christian <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1077&>, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Christian rushed for 40 yards and caught five passes for 62 yards at Green Bay. The Falcons are using him more often, and Christian makes a good backup RB right now.

Elvis Grbac <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Grbac threw for 261 yards, two TDs and was intercepted four times by the Browns. The veteran QB has been a big disappointment this year and should not start for most Fantasy teams.

Jason Brookins <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Brookins rushed for 89 yards on 21 carries against the Browns. The rookie is a servicable, yet unspectacular Fantasy player who should give you some occasional TDs down the stretch. 

Tim Couch <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=133260&>, QB CLE - Bees Updated 11/18/01
Couch threw for only 144 yards and was intercepted three times at Baltimore. The Cleveland QB appears to be a risk even as a Fantasy backup right now.

Benjamin Gay <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844! &k! ey=245054&>, RB CLE - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
Gay saw his first extensive action of the year, carrying the ball 18 times for 56 yards and a TD at Baltimore. He displayed good vision and lateral quickness, and Gay is definitely worth picking up if you need help at RB. 

James Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235220&>, RB CLE - Clubbers Updated 11/18/01
Jackson (ankle) did not play at Baltimore. Benjamin Gay and Jamel White shared carries in his place. 

Lamar Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Manchester United Updated 11/18/01
Smith rushed for only 53 yards on 19 carries against the Jets. Smith appears to be mired in mediocrity right now, and he is a risky start unless you lack depth at RB.

Chris Chambers <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=1844&key=235203&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01
The rookie wideout caught only two passes for 25 yards against the Jets. Chambers is still too inconsistent to start for most Fantasy teams.

Enron Accused of Infringing Patent for Electronic Trading

     Marshall, Texas, Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the
largest energy trader, and its online unit are accused in a
lawsuit of infringing a Texas company's patent for an electronic
trading system.

     Bid/Ask LLC of Baird, Texas, formerly called Auction Source
LLC, said it is the sole rights owner of a patent issued in May
2000 for a ``Real-time Network Exchange with Seller Specified
Exchange Parameters and Interactive Seller Participation.''

     Houston-based Enron and its EnronOnline unit are improperly
using that patented technology through its Internet-based
electronic trading facility, according to the lawsuit filed Sept.
17 in federal court in Marshall, Texas. Enron trades commodities
such as natural gas and electricity on that trading network.

     Bid/Ask seeks a court order blocking Enron from infringing
the patent, and is asking for damages.

     EnronOnline began trading electricity and natural gas in
November 1999. Between then and the second quarter of 2001, it's
handled more than 1 million transactions valued at more than $685
billion, the company has said.

     Enron, which also trades space on fiber-optic networks, coal,
paper and other commodities, had net income of $979 million on
revenue of $100.8 billion in 2000.

     An official with Enron couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.

     Shares of Enron rose 13 cents to $28.52 in midafternoon
trading.

"The McKinsey Quarterly Newsletter - November 2001","
 The McKinsey Quarterly Newsletter: November 2001 	
  If you would prefer to view this newsletter as a Web page, point your Web browser to: http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/newsletters/2001_11.htm   [IMAGE]  Greetings from The McKinsey Quarterly!  This month's Top 5 list focuses on strategy, a category in which McKinsey authors grapple with uncertainty, defined by Mr. Webster as ""a lack of certitude ranging from a small falling short of definite knowledge to an almost complete lack of it."" The by-product is often an inability to make decisions.  Since September 11, uncertainty seems to have gone exponential. In addition to the possibility of further terrorist attacks, managers must come to terms with recession in much of the global economy and a host of industry-specific concerns.  Fortunately, some kinds of uncertainty are both knowable and addressable. Given the right tools and frameworks, managers can make strategic decisions even in these difficult circumstances. To this end, we offer the articles on our strategy page.  See you at the site!  Lang Davison Editor, mckinseyquarterly.com  [IMAGE]  This month at mckinseyquarterly.com   The other side of outsourcing   ""Infraservices"" is the business of running the businesses nobody else wants. It may not be glamorous, but plenty of money can be made running routine operations (think: building maintenance or payroll processing) for other companies. In the past few years, providers of infraservices have been entering the market in increasing numbers. Should your company be in this business?  Building trust on-line   A funny thing happens when you survey consumers about on-line privacy. Typically, their biggest concern isn't that information about them will be captured by marketers but that marketers will give nothing in return. The authors of this article explore the notion of collaborative ""value exchanges"" as a way for companies to win their customers' trust.  Internet services: Who's smiling now?   Now that growth in Internet traffic is slowing down, traditional IT players such as AT&T, EDS, and IBM have gained the advantage in Internet hosting and content distribution over their smaller, more specialized competitors. This article examines the way changes in Internet traffic patterns are playing to the strengths of the big boys.  Unbundling the unbundled   Companies in the utility business used to be hulking and monolithic. Then they got skinnier and more nimble by, for instance, breaking electricity provision into its component parts. Now more change is in store as core activities-ownership, management, and service delivery-get unbundled from one another and treated as separate businesses.  Vaccines where they're needed   Most people in the developing world go without the vaccines they need largely because the economics of drug development in rich countries don't line up with the economics of health care provision in poor ones. Governments and international organizations can remedy this deplorable situation by assuming some of the risks now borne by drugmakers.  Thailand's chance for no-pain gain   This article, outlining a report from the McKinsey Global Institute, identifies policy reforms that Thailand could make to raise productivity in key industries, without resorting to subsidies or additional government spending. These reforms, the authors argue, should be undertaken with careful consideration of their economic and social implications.  [IMAGE]  This month's top 5 articles on Strategy   Making the most of uncertainty  The future of the networked company  Strategy under uncertainty  Creative destruction  Creating a knowledge culture   [IMAGE]  Share the wealth!

[IMAGE]   2nd Circuit Upholds Buffer Zones Near Women's Clinics  New York Law Journal The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the imposition of buffer zones separating pro-life protesters from abortion clinics and reproductive health centers. The court also upheld a New York district court judge's decision to withdraw an exception to the buffer zones he'd imposed in 1992. The so-called ""sidewalk exception"" had allowed two protesters to enter the zones to ""counsel"" patients entering and leaving clinics.   Full Text    Finders Keepers: Record Exec Loses Bid for Golden Oldies  Fulton County Daily Report When Capricorn Records founder Philip M. Walden left artifacts from Georgia's music history in his company's abandoned studio, he lost them for good, the Georgia Court of Appeals ruled. The items include promotional materials, T-shirts and engagement contracts from the likes of Otis Redding and the Allman Brothers. Walden sued the building's new owner after discovering the owner planned to auction the items on the Internet. Full Text    ABA Panel OKs Partnering With Foreign Lawyers  New Jersey Law Journal The ABA's Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility has issued an opinion saying partnering with foreign lawyers doesn't automatically conflict with the stricture against splitting fees with nonlawyers, as long as such partnerships comply with relevant state laws. The ABA had received many inquiries from lawyers seeking assurances they were on solid footing with their international partnerships.  Full Text     New RICO Target: Hiring Illegal Aliens  The National Law Journal The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has reinstated a case between two cleaning companies over the alleged illegal hiring of undocumented workers. The decision could open the door for suits between private companies under the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations statute (RICO). The class action was filed in Hartford, Conn., by Commercial Cleaning Services against competitor Colin Service Systems.  Full Text    Suit Accuses Johnson & Johnson of Widespread Race Discrimination  New Jersey Law Journal Just one week after a New Jersey state jury cleared Johnson & Johnson in a discrimination case, the company was hit with a federal class action alleging systemic racial bias in employment. The suit was filed on behalf of more than 1,000 African-American and Hispanic employees. The plaintiffs' lawyers include Johnnie Cochran and Cyrus Mehri, who was co-lead counsel in discrimination suits against Texaco and Coca-Cola. Full Text    FTC Targets Hearst Corporation  The Deal The U.S. Federal Trade Commission wants to require the New York media giant Hearst Corp. to forfeit $19 million in profits earned from an illegal 1998 merger, according to a tentative settlement. Such disgorgement of profits would be a first in a merger case, and is yet another signal that Bush administration antitrust agencies take Hart-Scott-Rodino compliance very seriously.

Some plaintiffs' lawyers think it's coming with terrorism relief. Many bills passed by Congress after Sept. 11 include limits on victims' right to sue airlines, aircraft makers, airports, the city of New York and even Osama bin Laden.

"Baltic Exchange changes","Please review the proposed changes(shown in blue) to the Tanker Freight products as a result of the Baltic Exchange index changes.  If we receive your approval of the change, we will make the change to the short and long description this weekend.

Tkr Freight Swap BITR BDTI 9                  Dec01           WS/mt

A financial swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays a Fixed Price in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline.  The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index.  The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001.
The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

December 26, 2001

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

RE:		EXCHANGE TO EXTEND NATURAL GAS TRADING HOURS TOMORROW

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will extend trading in its natural
gas futures and options contracts to 2:45 PM from their regular closing time

                     Attached is a memorandum from Sullivan & Cromwell
concerning the above subject.  A summary is also included at the end
of the text of this e-mail message.

                     The attached file is in Adobe Acrobat format.  We believe most PCs will already have an Acrobat viewer

SUMMARY

                                         On October 23, 2001, the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued a statement setting forth a framework
for evaluating whether, and to what extent, to credit a company
for self-policing, self-reporting, remediation and cooperation. The SEC encourages companies to self-report potential violations
of federal securities laws to the SEC by acknowledging that the
SEC may credit a company's cooperation in deciding whether and
how to take enforcement action.  The elements of cooperation set
forth by the SEC in its statement offer both significant rewards
and risks to reporting companies.

Morning Radio Program Host's Statements Were 'Pure Opinion' Not Actionable as Libel
Supreme Court, Bronx
The court dismissed the complaint of libel against radio host Don Imus of WFAN's ""Imus in the Morning"" brought by a Division of Motor Vehicles employee whom Imus disparaged on the air, finding that the facts before it showed that the complained-of speech was clearly prefaced by, and couched within, a statement by Imus concerning his alleged personal experiences upon which the complained-of opinion was based.

A Sign of the Times
The Recorder 
A small sign reading ""God Bless America"" has propelled a quiet, suburban elementary school in California to the center of the debate over the separation of church and state. The school sign may test how far the American Civil Liberties Union is willing to go in challenging what it perceives as religious messages on public buildings, and how far the courts are willing to go towards defining what is religious, and what is patriotic.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

>
>The Company has carved out its niche within the management and hospitality
>industry through management contracts with name hotel properties within
>the South, Florida region. Vector Holdings' present strategy to maximize
>shareholder value is to acquire ""boutique"" hotels located in South Beach,
>Florida through its relationships and existing contracts.
>****************************************************************
>
>INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITY
>
>When you talk about real estate, you talk about LOCATION, LOCATION. When
>you talk about Commercial Hotel real estate, you talk about LOCATION,
>LOCATION and MANAGEMENT. VHLD appears to be on to something, VHLD's
>present strategy to maximize shareholder value is to acquire ""boutique""
>hotels located in South Beach, Florida.
>
>For those Wizard subscribers who are not familiar with South Beach,
>Florida market, let The Wizard try to describe. First, this area is home
>to nearly 800 Art Deco buildings which were primarily constructed during
>the 1920s, 30s and 40s. The South Beach area is comprised of small
>""boutique"" hotels, nightclubs, restaurants and lots of chic shopping
>stores. South Beach is a unique area to Miami Beach, from 1st street to
>12th street, including Ocean Drive, Collins Avenue, and Washington Avenue.
>Miami Dade's hotel occupancy rates have lead the nation for the first five
>months of 2001. South Beach is strategically located near Miami's
>financial district and a very attractive destination to tourists from all
>over the world..
>
>VHLD's plan is to acquire existing ""boutique"" hotels in South Beach, FL.,
>that are currently operating and profitable. VHLD is simply taking
>existing hotels and attempting to make them better, by partnering with an
>experienced hotel management company that has a proven track record of
>doing exactly what VHLD is looking to accomplish.
>
>To this extent, VHLD has retained Hospitality Advisory Group, Inc. (HAG),
>which is led by Mr. Richard Wilhelm. Richard Wilhelm is a hotel management
>professional, with over thirty years of experience in management of a
>number of premier hotel and resort properties in the United States. These
>properties include such landmark hotels as the Plaza Hotel, the St. Regis
>and the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City; Trump Castle in Atlantic City;
>and recently, the Island Outpost group of hotels in Miami Beach's popular
>South Beach area.
>
>The core business of HAG is that of providing comprehensive hotel
>management services to their clients, which is VHLD. Services typically
>provided include the full spectrum of operational, financial, and
>marketing management of hotel properties. HAG works in every appropriate
>way to drive revenues. A key element in HAG?s management program is the
>focus on a comprehensive, targeted sales and marketing effort to ""put
>heads in the bed.
>**************************************************************
>
>VALUATION
>
>Some of the greatest corporations in America were created with a simple
>concept. VHLD is currently under contract to acquire prime South Florida
>hotel properties that on average are 70% occupied year round. By
>partnering with a top-notch hotel management company, leveraging off their
>expertise, hope to increase the annual occupancy rate to over 80% within 2
>years
>
>For example, HAG became the management company for the Tides Hotel in
>South Beach, Fl. when it reopened after a major renovation. By the end of
>the 1st year the Tides had an 88% occupancy rate.
>
>VHLD intends to acquire 9 hotels by the end of calendar year 2002 that
>will be running at an annualized revenue rate in excess of $100 MILLION
>DOLLARS. These 9 hotels assets will be in excess of $200 MILLION DOLLARS.
>VHLD intends to close on 3 of the nine hotels by the end of this calendar
>year (2001). These three hotels are estimated to generate $12.8 Million
>Dollars in revenue's and Net Operating Income (NOI) of $2.5 Million
>Dollars on assets of $28 Million Dollars in 2002.
>
>VHLD intends to close on their 1st hotel within 30 days. When achieved
>this should become a significant milestone for VHLD as well as the stock.
>The first hotel is called The Astor VHLD currently manages The Astor. The
>Astor was originally built in 1936 and remodeled in 1995. VHLD is Buying
>The Astor for $16 Million Dollars in a combination of cash and debt
>(mortgage).
>
>In year 2000 The Astor generated about $5.5 Million in revenues and had
>approx. $1 Million NOI.
>
>According to HAG, based upon their projections using their management
>techniques, HAG projects The Astor?s revenues to rise to $7.2 Million and
>NOI to $1.5 Million in 2002.
>
>In addition, HAG projects that in all hotel acquisitions by VHLD, a
>portion of the profits in the 1st year under their management will be
>reinvested back into the hotels for improvements. Thereafter HAG projects
>NOI to approximate 25% of revenues. REMEMBER, VHLD is currently acquiring
>only profitable hotels, and looking to make them more profitable.
>
>VHLD is currently trading near a 52 week low. VHLD has been working
>quietly on achieving its goal of increasing shareholder value. There is
>hardly any news on VHLD, and virtually no chat over on the Internet. The
>Wizard believes this too might change shortly. The Wizard believes that
>once VHLD closes on the Astor Hotel the story becomes a little bit more
>believable. BUY ON THE RUMOR.
>*****************************************************************
>
>CONCLUSION
>
>One way to value a company is to look at its peers in the industry. Within
>this group companies currently trade at about a 50% discount to the S&P
>500 index, which equates to about 14x earnings. Based on VHLD closing 3
>hotels by year-end, and using HAG's forecast for profits of $2.5 Million
>or $0.26 cents per share. If VHLD were to trade in the market at 14x
>earnings, then this would equate to a stock price of $3.64 per share.

"Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update","Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation (""AHC"") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC (""HESCO"") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01 (originals sent out 11/5/01);

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC (""HETCO"") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above are on my desk in a file marked ""Hess"".

"Proofs","I just went to order the pictures we had taken at the photographer's in
August.  They wouldn't let me order without the proofs.  They said there
are more numbers on the back of the proofs than we have.  Do you still
have the proofs?  I hope so, because they haven't come in the mail yet.
We would really appreciate it if you could send them as soon as possible.
 It takes four weeks to get the finished pictures after they are ordered
and we want to put some wallet sized copies in Christmas cards.  I hope
things have calmed down for you some at work.  I really hate to bother
you with this.

Love, Mother

PCS Nitrogen would like to assign their positions with Enron over to Bank of America.  The structure of the deal would be for B of A to step in between Enron and PCS.  Currently, PCS is out of the money to Enron.  This trade would lower B of A's exposure to Enron.    I would like to give an answer to PCS today.  Could you please review and let me know how we proceed o n this assignment.

Craig,
Attached is a sample assignment agreement sent to us by Bank of America.
It was one they had used with another deal, and has not been customized for
our particular situation.  As I understand Bank of America's verbal intent
is to have Bank of America step in between the obligations of our two
companies.

"Can you help me?","I was wondering if you might be able to help me.  I need to finish strong
this year.  I am attempting to reach the goal of $336,000 in clothing sales
by the end of the year.  Obviously, no single client will be able to help me
do this.  So I was wondering if you might be able to help me out by giving
me the names of some qualified gentlemen or ladies that might be interested
in the type of service we offer.

Some things to consider:

We offer ready-made (off the rack) clothing as well as custom.
We offer all types of men's clothing including casual.

If you know of some mid to upper level executive women, they may have an
interest as well.

Some memory joggers:

Who is the best dressed man or woman you know?
Who do you know that likes nice cars?
Who do you know that owns their own company?
Who do you know that is successful in sales?
Who do you know that wears an expensive watch?
Who do you know that owns their own airplane?
Who do you know that might have a hard time fitting in typical clothing?

Thanks for your help!

>To: mtaylo9@lsu.edu
>Subject: Are You Ready to Make a Fortune?
>Date: Sun, 18 Nov 2001 19:45:22 -0800
>
>Dear Investor Friend,
>
>As you may know, I have been making my subscribers rich for over a decade.
>
>As a best-selling investment author, ON24 Analyst, and award-winning
>editor of The Natural Contrarian financial publication, I have made
>thousands of investors mega-rich over the years.
>
>Just 10 weeks ago I told my Elite Subscribers about a stock which was
>trading at $2.76. Within 10 weeks it hit $5.06 -- a gain of 83%.
>
>Amazing? Maybe.
>
>But vast profits are commonplace for my Elite Subscribers.
>
>To put it simply, my Elite Subscribers have been making money
>hand-over-fist. And they are about to become even richer.
>
>You see, the stock I just told you about -- the one that shot up 83% in 10
>weeks -- will soon be going higher. Much higher.
>
>I will tell you more about that at a later date -- but first let me tell
>you about my track record.
>
>My last 3 oil and gas stock picks made 660%, 230%, and 915%. In fact, I am
>receiving constant ""thank you"" emails from my followers who have become
>multi-millionaires buying and selling my oil and gas stock picks over the
>last several months.
>
>Just think how your stock portfolio would look today if you had:
>
>* bought shares in Pennaco Energy at $2.50 and sold at $19
>* took a position in Atlas Pipelines -- before it lept over 230%
>* purchased Ultra Petroleum 11 months before it shot-up 915%
>
>In fact, if you had been one of my Elite Subscribers you would have made
>vast profits on Pennaco, Atlas and Ultra -- plus you would have racked up
>multiple triple-digit stock gains back-to-back.
>
>As you can see, many of my Elite Subscribers have become mega-rich. That's
>why they pay me $1,000 -- year in and year out.
>
>But my bottom line is this: even though you are not one of my Elite
>Subscribers (yet), I still want you to become rich.
>
>As one of my free subscribers, you won't receive the ultra-secret stock
>picks that I share with my Elite Subscribers. But once in awhile, I will
>tell you about a stock that will create vast profits for you.
>
>On one condition.
>
>I want you to promise to reserve some of your profits to become one of my
>Elite Subscribers.
>
>That's a fair deal, right?
>
>But remember, this gift has strings attached: I want you to promise that
>you will reserve $1,000 of your profits to become one of my Elite
>Subscribers.
>
>So get ready for my next email.
>
>And get ready to make a fortune.
>
>Yours,
>

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Brent--there is a lot of talk down here about wanting to use a ""short from"" financial master for recurring trades with retail counterparties.  There have been a couple of drafts floating around in connection with the now defunct Fast Track initiative.  Is there a standard form of a short form financial master that has already been fully reviewed by the company and that would be ready and proper for EES to use?  Thanks.  MDS

"The McKinsey Quarterly Newsletter - October 2001","
 The McKinsey Quarterly Newsletter 	
[IMAGE]  Greetings from The McKinsey Quarterly!  This month, for the first time, we're pleased to begin offering users with e-mail readers to support it the McKinsey Quarterly newsletter in HTML format. We've made the newsletter light on graphics to minimize download time. If you prefer a text version instead,  please click here to reach your profile page , where you can adjust your settings.  Also this month, we introduce a rotating Top 5 list, which in the months to come will visit the many industry and functional categories that make up our site. October's list focuses on the corporate-finance  function. Among other things, McKinsey authors present a postmortem on the Nasdaq crash, explain how companies can avoid vendor-financing disasters, and debunk the illusion that costs deserve more attention than revenues after a merger.  See you at the site!  Lang Davison Editor, mckinseyquarterly.com  [IMAGE]  This month at mckinseyquarterly.com   Making the most of uncertainty   Is your company a shaper or an adapter? Shapers get most of the glory in the press, but adapting can be just as lucrative. The secret of this essential strategic choice is that the more uncertain your markets are, the better your chance to shape them in a direction of your own choosing.  Managing the asset manager   Since asset-management companies rely so much on talent, they must be top-notch at recruiting, developing, rewarding, and retaining it-right? Actually, our survey shows that only some of them manage their talent well. Surprise, surprise-these are the firms that deliver the best returns to shareholders.  What do broadband consumers want?   The US broadband population has moved beyond predominantly young and male early adopters to comprise both sexes and a wide cross-section of age, family composition, and income. This article segments these new users into helpful categories and behavioral patterns that companies can employ for savvy decisions about Web site development and marketing.  Weathering telecom's dark and stormy night   Telecommunications companies, struggling with staggering debt, sluggish revenues, and a pummeling from the stock market, may be passing through their dark night of the soul. Yet in this interview, McKinsey adviser Reed Hundt, a recent chairman of the FCC, explains why the future still looks good for this beleaguered industry.  Has outsourcing gone too far?   The race to hand over capital-intensive manufacturing assets to outside suppliers may be leading some companies to cede the very skills and processes that have distinguished them in the marketplace. This article suggests a better way to resolve the make-versus-buy riddle.  Remaking China's giant steel industry   Demand for steel in China is set to soar in the coming decade. Yet China's steel producers, which face the daunting task of shedding their quota mind-set and focusing on what their customers want, are in poor shape to take advantage of their homeland's boom. Can they rise to the task?  [IMAGE]  Top 5 articles on Corporate Finance   Why mergers fail  Deals that create value  The people problem in mergers  What happened to the bull market?  The winner-takes-all economy   [IMAGE]  Share the wealth!  If you know colleagues who would be interested in The McKinsey Quarterly, please forward this e-mail message to them .

Jeff, 

I just wanted to check whether the Trading Meeting was actually taking place today (Justin wondered whether it would be cancelled as you have the All-Employee Meeting). 

Hope you are well.

Joanne -

I believe Pat was inquiring as to TradeSpark.  We have agreements with ENA and EPMI that were signed earlier this year.  I believe we also have one with EES, but this was negotiated by Will F.  We would have to check with him about the status.

Let me know what needs to be done on this matter.

Full Text     Malpractice Claim Can't Be Based on Anticipated Legal Error, New Jersey Court Rules  New Jersey Law Journal Is it malpractice to abandon a losing argument when doggedness could lead to a juicy settlement? A New Jersey appeals court says it's not. ""Plainly, it would be bad public policy if a malpractice claim could be predicated on an anticipated legal error,"" the court said. The plaintiff had sued a Hackensack firm for not arguing to have his product liability case tried under New Jersey law.  Full Text    9th Circuit Judge's Kid Makes Federal Case out of Jaywalking Ticket  The Recorder Challenging the status quo must run in the family.

Subject:	Baltic Exchange changes

Please review the proposed changes(shown in blue) to the Tanker Freight products as a result of the Baltic Exchange index changes.  If we receive your approval of the change, we will make the change to the short and long description this weekend.

Tkr Freight Swap BITR BDTI 9                  Dec01           WS/mt

A financial swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays a Fixed Price in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline.  The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index.  The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001.
The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

December 27, 2001


NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS A MODIFIED
PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM


At its meeting on December 27, 2001, the NYMEX Board of Directors determined
to extend, with certain modifications, the current Proprietary Fee Reduction
Program (""Program"") through December 2002.

Effective trade date January 2, 2002, Member Firms and individual members
who own seats will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 6 cents per
round turn (3 cents per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 1.25 cents per
round turn (.625 cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members' accounts should NOT adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments directly
to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention
to NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the
alpha code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please contact M. Dawn
Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.

Subject: Just so you know


John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.

"EOL - Phase III","Mark -

EOL is embarking on a Phase III project to update the look and feel of the site.  The project was awarded to a company called 2Advanced Studios out of California and is valued at $38,300. 

For Phase II development last March (2000), a company called Viant Corp. was used.  That company signed the APS and MSA, together with a software license agreement.  These agreements were with Corp.

While I plan to use the APS with 2Advanced - and have already been working with them on it, I am curious as to whether or not this needs to be a Corp. contract or if I can run it through either Net Works or EnronOnline LLC.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.

Lisa -

Attached is a Data Services Agreement between EOL and CommodityLogic.  This agreement is intended to lay out the terms under which EOL will be providing the on-line transaction data to CommodityLogic for subsequent delivery to Enron customers.  I have not completed some of the technical aspects of the Schedules, but, rather, have left them to be determined by the appropriate EOL/CommodityLogic personnel.  I have also left the pricing blank as it was my understanding that this was being determined by Brad and Tom Gros.  This agreement is intended to go along with the waiver and consent document I previously provided.

Please look over the attached at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.  Please feel free to forward this to Savita or Brad as you deem applicable.

Thanks.

Mark

"RE: Trade Sactions","Paul,

Attached is a link to the OFAC website, which indicates that Serbia and Montenegro are still sanctioned. <http://ofaccompliance.com/BlockedCountries.htm>

Relatedly, if you are specific about the list of countries in your GTCs, you may want to consider being less specific, as you correctly point out that the list will change from time to time.  

When I last spoke with our external counsel on this matter, she advised me that in large part it is the knowing act of dealing with product destined to or originating from sanctioned countries.  We talked about a soft-peddled rep that does not specifically mention trade sanctions or the countries, but does rep generally about non-violiation of US law.  This is the direction in which I have gone.  Of course, the traders are aware of the list of sanctioned countries, and will be updated from time to time.

Guys - do you know/has there been any internal briefing in Houston on whether these sanctions are or are about to be lifted? This effects the ""compliance with US laws"" clause in the physical metals GTCs. 

Another related question from the same trader concerns Canadian origin Nickel, but known to be made from Cuban material. I set this out below, and would be grateful fr your views.

Many thanks

Paul J.


QUOTE
Paul,

Thanks for your quick response, and I am awaiting your final evaluation of the Canadian production.

Obviously I have no interest to enter into any talks with the supplier without a clear go ahead from your end - I have been made aware of the company policy towards 'grey areas' already.

Another issue I noticed is that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Serbia are still on the list of prohibited countries - are we sure this is the latest, as most international sanctions against those two countries have been lifted over the past 12 months.

Paul,

Further my query re the situation on Yugoslavia/Serbia, below message seems to indicate that international sanctions against the both countries have been lifted or are about to be lifted, and that the lifting of Un sanctions is being supported by the US government.

Please revert with your clarification.

Thanks

Subject:	Bingaman Draft On Transparency -- Amendment Ideas


Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under ""information required"" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the ""timely basis"" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

""(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add ""appropriate"" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of ""appropriate"" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like ""consistent with ..."" or ""promote competition"" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

When Is A Software Invention Actually Ready For Patenting?    The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recently affirmed  a District Court decision of patent invalidity under the on-sale  provisions of 35 U.S.C. ?102(b). Robotic Vision Sys.,  Inc. v. View Eng'g, Inc and General Scanning, Inc., 249 F.3d  1307 (Fed. Cir. 2001). The Federal Circuit applied the new two  prong on-sale bar test from Wayne K. Pfaff v. Wells Elecs.,  Inc., 525 U.S. 55 (1998).    In the Pfaff case, the Supreme Court, referred to drawings  and other descriptions of an invention as proof that the invention  is complete and hence ready for patenting. Using the new Pfaff  test, the Federal Circuit held in the Robotic Vision case that a software invention was ready  for patenting when one of the inventors verbally described the invention  to a co-worker in sufficient detail to allow him to practice it,  even though the actual software used to practice the invention  did not exist before the on-sale bar date.    The Robotic Vision case helps illustrate the dynamic nature  of patent law used to protect high-tech inventions. It also illustrates  the caution that must be exercised when attempting to protect  high-tech inventions including methods that are implemented with  software. The conduct of inventors as well as marketing or sales  materials that could describe details of software inventions must  now receive more scrutiny to avoid inadvertent on-sale bars under  ?102(b).

Carol,

As mentioned in my voice mail, attached are amendments we have requested Enron Corp. to issue with respect to: (a) ENA's & EPMI's physical power transactions, and (b) ENA's financial transactions with Allegheny.

Allegheny was familiar with Enron's amendment form, so in the interest of time I have used that form in crafting these amendments.

4. Our Favorite Yacht Cruises

Most yachts offer the flexibility that bigger cruise ships can't: an almost
limitless number of places to dock, an itinerary that can change with the
weather and the whim of the passengers, and all sorts of amenities - from
e-mail access to on-board spas - that mimic the luxuries of a five-star
resort. For information on a few of our favorite yacht cruises - from the
Greek Islands to the Alaskan coast to the British Virgin Islands, visit the
TRIP.com NewsStand at:
http://www.trip.com/trs/trip/content/newsstand/newsstand_article.xsl?newsstand-category-id=9&newsstand-category-nm=on%20your%20side&newsstand-article-id=5302


5. Cruise Lines Implement Heightened Security Measures

In response to the tragedies of September 11 - and in an effort to ensure the
security and safety of passengers - the International Council of Cruise Lines
(ICCL) has issued a series of guidelines, which recommend that cruise lines
tighten existing security measures and implement new ones.

These guidelines, adopted by all the major cruise lines, include
identification requirements (passengers must show photo ID before boarding),
more thorough baggage inspection at all ports of call, and visitor
restrictions (bridge visits have been eliminated). In addition, uniformed and
plain-clothes security personnel have been placed aboard many ships, and
crews are undergoing stricter security screenings and background checks.

Most cruise itineraries are operating as scheduled, though it's important to
confirm both cruise and flight schedules before departure. If your flight is
cancelled, call TRIP.com at 1-888-484-3874 (1-888-4-THE-TRIP) and a customer
service representative can help you make alternative flights plans.

As just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this. But, I do want to warn you that everyone here, including Frank, is engaged in a number of high priority projects related to, among other things, entering into master netting agreements and the like to manage the credit issues affecting the Company. Accordingly, the timetable for a reply may not be in line with your expectations.

Jane, I noted that the draft of the GTCs had a glitch in the Business Day definition. You should resend to Frank.

Subject:	EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap 

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

*********************

Please leave me a message or send me an email if you want me to call you Monday evening your time.

 

   


Thanks very much for your help..

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Subject:	Deseret Financial Swap:  Please review

Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve

US Benzene Fin Opt  
A financial Option Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which the Seller receives the Premium and the Buyer receives the Cash Settlement Amount. Each calendar month during the Term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that if the Term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month the Determination Period shall be the Term of the Transaction. The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be calculated from the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website in accordance with the unit of measure. The Premium shall equal the product of (i) the price submitted by Counterparty via the website, multiplied by (ii) the number of calendar days during the Term of the Transaction, multiplied by (iii) the volume submitted by Counterparty on the website. The Payment Date for the Premium shall be 2 business days after the Trade Date of the Transaction. The Payment Date(s) for the Cash Settlement Amount shall be 5 business days after the Cash Settlement Amount is determinable. Where this Transaction is a Call Option, the Cash Settlement Amount shall be the sum of the product of (a) the Notional Quantity per day during the Determination Period, multiplied by (b) the greater of (i) zero, or (ii) the Index minus the Strike Price. Where this Transaction is a Put Option, the Cash Settlement Amount shall be the sum of the product of (a) the Notional Quantity per day during the Determination Period, multiplied by (b) the greater of (i) zero, or (ii) the Strike Price minus the Index. Where this Transaction is a Straddle Option, the Cash Settlement Amount shall be the sum of the product of (a) the Notional Quantity per day during the Determination Period, multiplied by (b) the absolute difference between the Strike Price and the Index.

The Exercise Period(s) shall be the last Trading Day of the month. The Index for a month shall be the mean of the average of the high and low price in Cents/Gallon of Benzene published under the headings ""Prices for Period Ending [DATE]: United States: Benzene)"" under the caption ""SPOT: Cents/Lb."" in each issue of Chemical Market Associates, Inc.'s Aromatics Market Report (Weekly) that reports prices effective for such month.

> automatic abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.
> When submitting an E/A form, please note the following:
>
> (a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
> (b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
> are subject to automatic
> 	Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in strike
> prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
> (c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
> strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a
> position in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to
> notify Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have
> an officer available to confirm such intention.
> (d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
> to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.
>
> 3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,

> 	*****
> A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
> process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department:
> 1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
> report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
> based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
> CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
> close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
> adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
> gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for
> clearance on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR
> transactions which have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and
> trade information submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this
> report will also reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment
> instructions, the projected number of exercises and maximum potential
> assignments for each strike price, the type of exercise (manual or
> automatic), whether the strike is In, At or Out of the money, and the
> exercise value associated therewith based on settlement prices established
> by COMEX on the day of expiration.
>
> 2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
> expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
> day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
> Prior to 2:30 PM.
>
> Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report
> and transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether
> trades have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by
> COMEX's On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.
>
> B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
> including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
> COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
> Clearing Department.
>
> C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
> Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.
>
> D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
> will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
> Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
> options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
> assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement
> carefully.  Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or
> more will be automatically exercised, not all short option positions will
> be assigned if there are any options manually abandoned at such strike
> prices.  Please note that there also may be some at or out-of-the money
> options being exercised.
>
> E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
> available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.
>
> It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
> properly trained to handle the option expiration process available
> beginning at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific
> times.  It is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports

>
> To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
> members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement

Subject: Migration of Clickpaper Application to EOL (Obligations to 


Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.  

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder

Robbie - here is the contract with Ariba we were discussing yesterday.  Just want to get legal coverage of a couple of issues regarding how we should proceed once we stop using Ariba for clickpaper.com.

- we will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  do we need to notify them?
- i will send them the final accounting of transactions cleared through the ariba software at the end of 3rd quarter (they invoice us for a small fee for each transaction.)  I assume no further communication with Ariba will be required on my part.
- need to determine if we need to take any steps for contract termination, or simply let the arrangement expire next spring.  presumably we do not want to renew, nor do we want to terminate early on the small chance someone might want to use the licenses in the meantime.
 
Please let me know what questions you have...

thanks
KNC

"FW: Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update - Revised","

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Sayre, Frank  
Sent:	Tuesday, November 06, 2001 6:14 PM
To:	Heard, Marie; St. Clair, Carol; Cook, Mary
Cc:	Taylor, Mark E (Legal); Hendry, Brent; Shackleton, Sara; Bailey, Susan; Panus, Stephanie; Boyd, Samantha; Jones, Tana; Heard, Marie; Keiser, Holly
Subject:	Amerada Hess and Carolina Power & Light Update

Last Friday, Amerada Hess opted to proceed first with getting the ISDA Master Agreement between ENA and Amerada Hess Corporation (""AHC"") completed before addressing the Master Netting Agreement, which they believe is subject to fraudulent transfer issues, etc.  The following has occurred:

a.	Enron Corp. multiproduct guaranty in amount of $75,000,000 executed and sent to AHC on 10/29/01, as was Certificate of Incumbency attesting to authority of Mary Perkins to  sign the guaranty;

b. 	Initial draft of our comments to AHC's form Schedule was sent to AHC on 10/30/01;

c.	Draft Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex received from AHC on 11/2/01;

d.	Assignment and Novation of Transactions document agreeing to assignment of financial trades previously done by Hess Energy Services Company, LLC (""HESCO"") to AHC executed and sent to AHC for execution on 11/2/01;

e. 	First Amendment to Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC (""HETCO"") ISDA Master Agreement setting collateral threshold for both parties at $5,000,000 executed and sent to HETCO by fax on 11/2/01; originals were sent to Hess for execution of 11/5/01;

f.	Conference call with Chuck Cerria and Dana Dellacona to review Schedule; 

g.	 Letter agreement agreeing to assignment of physical gas trades previously done by Hess Energy Services to AHC executed and sent returned to AHC on 11/6/01; 

h.	Received request on 11/6/01 from Chuck Cerria at AHC to look at form of Assignment and Novation of Transactions document used for HESCO assignment for use in assigning all of AHC's financial trades to HETCO.  Reviewed document and, after confirming that I did not have any authority to sign off on the documents or the structure of the assignment until after I received the approval of Bill Bradford and our credit group, I told Mr. Cerria that they looked ok to me but probably would have to be expanded to include a statement that the transactions in question would fall under HETCO ISDA Master Agreement.  Mr. Cerria is amending the documents accordingly;

i.	On 11/6/01 sent rough draft of mark-up of Paragraph 13 to Credit Support Annex to Dana Dellacona with caveat that ENA credit had not reviewed the document, the document was being sent merely to expedite the ISDA negotiation process and the document was subject to change by ENA after credit review; also worked through it with Dana and John Butala.  Dana will be redrafting it and sending a new draft;

j.	Received redraft of Schedule to ISDA from Dana Dellacona for review during afternoon of 11/6/01.

I have told everyone at AHC that I will be out of the office on 11/7/01 but can be reached until 11:30 am at my home [(713) 942-0007].  Copies of all of the above (except item ""f"") are on my desk in a file marked ""Hess"" and any documents I've drafted are on a disk marked ""Hess"" or in my email files (Holly can get into these).

A few things.

	- John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks

"RE: ECC vs. ENA deals","The physical gas is not the problem....CAS is showing that financial deals have been booked with Duke Energy Marketing LP and ECC and also ENA.  Duke wants another ISDA so they beleive these trades exist too. Is the problem with the booking in our system or the confirming process or both? Physical trades will be with both entities as the agency agreement between ENA and ECC only applies to financial trades. We need to pull all of the financial trades with ECC and get to Mark Taylor's group today so that they can prepare an assignment of the ENA trades to the ECC master. Let's discuss.  Thanks for your help.

I ran three reports. One for Duke, Mirant, and Transcanada.  Looks like the issue is with Physical Gas.  I need to do a little more research in the a.m. to see what's going on.  I will let you know what I find out.

"(01-434) Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day","Notice No. 01-434
December 26, 2001


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations, COMEX Division

RE:		Spot Month Procedures on the Eve of First Notice Day


Please be reminded that Monday, December 31, 2001, is the First Notice Day,
for the Gold, Silver, Copper and Aluminum futures delivery month of January
2002 (the new spot month).

On Friday, December 28, 2001, the Eve of the First Notice Day, all Brokers
and Clearing Members must have a duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry
(""OLTE"") system trained representative available until such time as the
Exchange deems necessary.

It is imperative that trades involving the Spot Month are processed and
cleared properly.  Therefore, representatives are expected to make a
diligent effort to process all Spot Month trades accurately.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to show due
diligence involving Spot Month Trade processing may result in severe
disciplinary action by the Exchange.

If you should have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

The decision came in a case in which a jury awarded the statutory maximum of $100,000 in punitive damages on a woman's claim of sexual harassment stemming from a hostile work environment.   Full Text    Bristol-Myers Inflated Cancer Drugs' Prices, Teamsters Fund Charges  The Legal Intelligencer Bristol-Myers Squibb has been hit with a class action RICO suit for allegedly inflating the prices of its cancer drugs, including Taxol, a widely used breast cancer drug. The Teamsters Health & Welfare Fund of Philadelphia and Vicinity, the lead plaintiff in the suit filed in federal court in New York, is asking to represent a class that would include anyone who relied on the nationally published ""average wholesale price"" when paying for certain drugs. Full Text    Georgia Judge Denies Lethal Injection Hearing  Fulton County Daily Report The first Georgia jurist to declare electrocution unconstitutional refused Monday to schedule a hearing on a similar challenge to lethal injection. Timothy Carl Dawson's attorney argued for a hearing to examine the state's use of lethal injection, but Fulton Superior Court Judge Wendy L. Shoob said the Georgia Supreme Court ""has been quite clear that lethal injection is the acceptable method of carrying out the death penalty.""  Full Text     A Poor Call on Summary Judgment?  The Connecticut Law Tribune A Connecticut appellate court panel has concluded that a judge in a complex litigation court didn't have the power to decide a complicated legal malpractice case based solely on the written briefs. While the panel criticized the trend toward placing complex matters before trial judges for a ruling without trial, some litigators consider the ruling a setback for efficient litigation.  Full Text    Texas Court Does About-Face on Class Certification Appeal  Texas Lawyer The Texas Supreme Court's flip-flop regarding whether it has jurisdiction to hear an appeal challenging class certification in a case brought by 20,000 dentists against a software supplier has the dentists' attorneys crying foul. Many are seeking clarification on the court's jurisdiction in class certification matters.

A Scramble for Cover in Indian Case  Legal Times Some 39 lawyers and officials from the departments of Interior, Justice and Treasury have been summoned to appear before U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., in connection with a long-running lawsuit over a massive Indian trust fund. But the current charges have less to do with the fund than with what plaintiffs say is a long history of obfuscation, delay and outright lying by the government in the litigation itself. Full Text    [IMAGE]  2001 Summer Associates Survey  L Online Last year's L/The American Lawyer Summer Associates Survey found a nationwide phenomenon of blissfully happy and secure summer associates who had never known a bad economy. That's no longer the case. But the picture's not too grim: This year's summer associates were quite pleased with the work they did, and most said that should their firm make an offer, they'd take it without looking back.

But now, says Gary Mathiason -- the San Francisco-based firm's de facto visionary -- Littler is gaining the upper hand. As once high-flying law firms struggle to regain their footing, tortoises like Littler that crawled through the boom are looking a lot smarter in the bust. Full Text    Back on Firm Ground  Legal Times Attorney Jason Karp splits his week between Kelley Drye & Warren's office in Virginia and a struggling tech company where he is general counsel. Such creative scheduling marks a curious move in Kelley Drye's effort to build a technology practice when many firms are scaling back. The firm is paying GCs from troubled startups full salaries, despite their part-time schedules. Full Text    [IMAGE]  Lawyer Wonders How Sept. 11 Affected Jurors in Marathon Job-Bias Trial  New Jersey Law Journal   A nearly six-month-long employment bias trial has the plaintiff's attorney wondering whether the events of Sept. 11 helped stack the deck against his Iranian-born client.

"FW: Revised Loss Definition.DOC","Kim, 

I have reviewed the language your counsel sent and have discussed it with our General Counsel.  We can agree to remove the loss of bargain concept but not the other two damage concepts.  We do not agree to the removal of ""cost of funding"" since this can be a very real issue when a replacement transaction requires a premium to be paid because of the off-market position.  Premiums for such positions will have a cost of funding component.  The removal of the concept of ""loss or cost incurred as a result of terminating, liquidating, or obtaining or reestablishing a hedge or trading position"" is also a very real factor in calculating damages.  It may very well be that the termination of a hedge is the more cost effective alternative to replacing the transaction.  Furthermore, the you can obtain the same effect of terminating a hedge by entering into an offsetting transaction (the equivalent of a replacement transaction) rather than an outright termination with the hedge counterparty. Because the termination of a hedge is the other side of the coin, so to speak, it makes sense to leave it in the definition of Loss.  We can clarify that such losses and costs are without duplication, which I think was one of your outside counsels concerns.  The definition of Loss as was written is designed so that the Non-defaulting party can recover the actual damages occasioned by the Defaulting Party's failure to perform.  If the Defaulting Party objects to the Non-defaulting Party's calculation then such calculation would be subject to negotiation or litigation and final determination by a New York court.  

We would propose modifying your changes to read as follows: 

Insert the following into Part 1(e), after the period at the end thereof.  

""The definition of Loss shall be amended and restated in its entirety as follows: 

""Loss"" means, with respect to this Agreement or one or more Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, the Termination Currency Equivalent of an amount that party reasonably determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner its total losses and costs (or gain, in which case expressed as a negative number), without duplication, in connection with this Agreement or that Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, including any cost of funding or, at the election of such party but without duplication, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading position (or any gain resulting from any of them).   to be equal to the actual replacement cost to that party in entering into a replacement transaction.  Loss does not include any loss of bargain, cost of funding or, loss or cost incurred as a result of its terminating, liquidating, obtaining or reestablishing any hedge or related trading positions.  Furthermore, Loss does not include loss of bargain, or  a party's legal fees and out-of-pocket expenses referred to under Section 11.  A party will determine its Loss as of the relevant Early Termination Date, or, if that is not reasonably practicable, as of the earliest date thereafter as is reasonably practicable.  A party may (but need not) determine its Loss by reference to quotations of relevant rates or prices from one or more leading dealers in the relevant market.""


 If the concept of a Replacement Value is preferable to you we are also willing to use the following definition, which was originally drafted by Goldman Sachs, in lieu of the Loss definition.
  
""Replacement Value"" , means, with respect to each Terminated Transaction or group of Terminated Transactions, as the case may be, and a party, an amount that the party (the ""Determining Party"") or its agent determines in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner to be its total losses and costs (or gains, in which case expressed as a negative number) in connection with that Terminated Transaction or group of terminated Transactions.  A Determining Party (or its agent) may determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions, any group of Terminated Transactions or individual Terminated Transactions, and may apply different valuation methods to different Transactions or groups of Transactions.   A Determining Party (or its agent) will determine Replacement Values for all Terminated Transactions as of the Early Termination Date, or, if that would not be commercially reasonable, as of the latest date or dates before or the earliest date or dates after the Early Termination Date as would be commercially reasonable under then prevailing circumstances.

The definition of Loss would be replaced throughout the ISDA by the definition of Replacement Value.  

We hope that one of these definitions will work for you.  Please call if you have any questions or comments on the definitions.

Regards,
Brent

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
Latest NFL Player News - Provided by Commissioner.COM

Keenan McCardell <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on Jimmy Smith.

Sta! ce! y Mack <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Manchester United Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk because of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1514&>, WR BAL - Team Sensitive Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free ! Ag! ent Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caug! ht! five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=235249&>, RB SD - Bees Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego's 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=12375&>, QB SD - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. However, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage. 

Jake Plummer <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Dirty Bastards Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. H! e'! s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1234&>, WR NO - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1511&>, WR NO - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Bees Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1663&>, RB NE - Baton Rouge Idiot Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=187741&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots' bench for another week.

Rich Gannon <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1184&>, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to the game.

Eric Moulds <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yards and two TDs again! st! Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1011&>, QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Bees Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and! 3! 9 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.

James Thrash <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1859&>, WR PHI - Clubbers Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. 

Rod Gardner <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestret! ch! . 

Ki-Jana Carter <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1089&>, RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.

Isaac Byrd <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1762&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/h! tt! p://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Manchester United Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1191&>, WR KC - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&rand! om! =213&key=1004&>, QB ATL - Anorexic Drunks Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander <http://football434.fantasy.nfl.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=lilwoodrows&owner=74388.6&random=213&key=1191&>, WR KC - Mandeville Marriage Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.

"Flowers & fragrance for indoors","
 [IMAGE]    Dear MARK,   As the outdoor growing season winds down, many gardeners crave the sight and touch of live plants indoors. After years of trials, we can recommend some highly reliable ways to keep winter at bay. Whether for your own home or for a gift, our flowering plants are a handsome source of color.    White Flower Farm customers have come to love the intoxicating mid-winter perfume of Jasmine . This subtropical vine produces cascades of delicate white flowers that exhale a rich sweet fragrance. We'll begin shipping plants as soon as they set buds, the week of Nov. 5.  [IMAGE]  Hanging Jasmine  (#32581)  will perfume your home.   [IMAGE] Garden Pinks   (set of 3)  We look forward every spring to the spicy clove scent of common Garden Pinks, and were delighted to discover that these hardy perennials can be made to bloom indoors in fall or winter. Our crop of the variety 'Little Pink'   has already begun to set buds and will brighten any windowsill space you can offer.   [IMAGE] Flowering Maple  (Abutilon pictum  'Thompsonii')  Our Victorian forebears discovered Flowering Maples, which remain perhaps the most prolific of flowering houseplants. Given sun and plenty of moisture, these sturdy plants will produce flowers 12 months a year. 'Thompsonii ' has the added attraction of gold-speckled foliage that contrasts with the salmon blooms.    [IMAGE] Rosemary Standard -  single  plant or a  pair      Rosemary won't survive the winter outdoors in much of the country. But our neat little standards will thrive in a sunny window indoors, providing plenty of snippings for savory sauces and stews. These handsome 14in plants are available as  singles  or pairs .      P.S. You'll find many other gifts for gardeners  on our Web site. And there's still time to order and plant Daffodils , Tulips , and other bulbs  for a glorious spring display.        Thank you for your interest in White Flower Farm. If you decide to place an order, please use reference  code 14851 when prompted during checkout.  To review our privacy statement click here.

November 20, 2001


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the December 2001 options contract for Copper (HXZ1)
and Aluminum (OAZ1) is Tuesday, November 27, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on the recently
announced shortened trading hours.

Trading in the December 2001 Copper and Aluminum Options Contracts will
cease at 1:00 P.M. and 1:10 p.m. respectively on November 27, 2001.  All
Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing Members of their intentions
to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.

On Tuesday, November 27, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Tuesday's submissions and processing will be
available on Wednesday morning November 28, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 7:30 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001
For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the  workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly  reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive  wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the  need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never  truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed  to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was  supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard.  
Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap  its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in  Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're  not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or  who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with  a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through  determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion.  These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins,  author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate  turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at  Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of  deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they  created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy,  No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile.  An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt  ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as  famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 
The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is  still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began  publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company  ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still  as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her  latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47,  remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the  subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring,  outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the  most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to  me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' ""  
PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to  take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back.  ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a  higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than  men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who  can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too  hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of  war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems  to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 
This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and  the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's  Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz  (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile  loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years.  The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon  gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone  expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon ).  
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last  year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that  influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby""  Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her  CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and  Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the  Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg  Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not  managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead  she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single  quarter.
While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use  to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance  of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her  company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is  likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on  mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on  this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that  generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26  million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106  international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah  Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence  on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of  lives they lead.  
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and  three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially  intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years  ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned  a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power  like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several  women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more.  That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that  some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly  Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where,  by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last  year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her  resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No.  11, from No. 7 last year. 
One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20).  Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never  imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt.  Barrett couldn't  afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond  believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she  says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade  before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She  made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's  top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of  customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and  provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision.  ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the  talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly  where she wants to be.  
Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their  companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have  to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,""  says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great  marks running international project development for Mirant's former  parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the  company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking  closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job  unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech  risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion  of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece,  you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35  at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got  it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is  expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a  regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own  boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this  year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 
One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of  FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in  the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was  21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty  range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT?Consumer. The reality,  though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst,  making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other  women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda  Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or  the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says  PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring  'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its  president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi  is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate  America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and  diligently doing her job.

Hi Savita,
 
I wanted to give you some detail on the two trades Jay Reitmeyer did with Enserco yesterday. These trades (see attached detail), were apparently unintentionally put on the web and Enserco subsequently hit them. Jay has asked Enserco to let the trades go, but they have said they won't. The prices on both are better than 80 cents out of the money and Jay has told his Risk desk to hold the Confirm and kill both deals in TAGG.
 
I wanted to fill you in on this as it looks like something Legal will definitely want to review.

This will confirm that the meetings with Weil for Sat and Sun will begin at 10am. Mark wants the entire team to be present for the Sat meeting. We will decide after that meeting who needs to be present on Sun. I have sent Weil a number of materials, including the 3rd quarter results given to the analysts. We anticipate that Sat will be a lawyers only meeting to discuss the corporate structure and the bankruptcy issues related to the different business units. The meeting will probably last 4-5 hours.
 
The Sun meeting will include the commercial team. An agenda will be prepared, but most of the day will be devoted to information gathering and brainstorming.

I have tried you at both the office and on your cell.  Your cell continues to state that all circuits are busy.  

I need about 15 minute to talk through a couple of CommodityLogic points that Tom and I reviewed this morning - mostly in relation to the ""CommodityHub.""  If you get a chance this evening or in the later afternoon tomorrow, please give me a call.  I will continue to try to reach you also.

Thanks.  Hope all is well.

"RE: Y14087.1","
When a crude financial derivative transaction is subject to an ISDA Master agreement, the use of the language ""NYMEX Trading Day"" in reference to Floating Price does not fit the correct definitional ISDA structure.  It should be ""Commodity Business Day"".  Please see that the appropriate financial derivative confirmation templates are revised accordingly.  If you have any questions, please call.

Currently, the use of NYMEX Trading Day is correct when used with a GTC/Annex A financial omnibus form as it does fit the definitional structure.  We will advise if and when this is changed.

Thank you.

"Metro Bus Passes and Woodlands Express Passes Available Effective  Friday, December 28, 2001","
Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

I have spoken with Ron Carletta at the CFTC and explained our position - that is that as far as we know the LJM entities have only engaged in exempt transactions and are not required to register as CPO's.  He has my name and number if he has any further questions.

"RE: Moorings","That sucks.  I am sorry.  I can't believe that are closing their entire
base there!    Crummy times all around.  Maybe one of the hotel things
from the luxury travel website will work out.  I think I saw a Paris one

of the weeks that it is available.   Bill and I have tickets on hold for
$219 into Ft Lauderdale on Delta.  I think I am going to log back into

I called the Moorings about a Miami charter over New Year's and they
said they are shutting down the entire location as of 11/30!  When I
asked about any other locations that might still have boats left, she
said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time.  Sorry.

Cover title: Enron's Cutthroat Culture 
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

How Enron Blew It 
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>> 
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me.""

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 

You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.

""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.

""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Subject:	Baltic Exchange changes

Please review the proposed changes(shown in blue) to the Tanker Freight products as a result of the Baltic Exchange index changes.  If we receive your approval of the change, we will make the change to the short and long description this weekend.

Tkr Freight Swap BITR BDTI 9                  Dec01           WS/mt

A financial swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays a Fixed Price in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline.  The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index.  The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001.
The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

"RE: Tradesbark","Joanne -

I believe Pat was inquiring as to TradeSpark.  We have agreements with ENA and EPMI that were signed earlier this year.  I believe we also have one with EES, but this was negotiated by Will F.  We would have to check with him about the status.

Let me know what needs to be done on this matter.

Subject:	POWER OF ATTORNEY ECTRIC- URGENT

Hello Teresa,

Apologies for the short notice. Please find attached a power of attorney we will need to have signed in order to register a claim on ECTRIC's behalf in Belgium. Please note the instructions on the bottom which indicate what the signor must write prior to his signature. Should I fax you a copy with my initials?

As well, Sue has informed me that there is no one indicated on the Houston data base as a legal rep to take care of the board minute which should go along with this. Do you know who that may be?

Sadly we need to be able to fax a copy of this to our solicitors in Belgium today. Can you please let me know whether you can obtain the signatures required for this power of attorney. Thanks again in advance and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. (0207 783 4084)

Kind Regards

Ian

Social Studies:  Some Useful Definitions

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbors help take care of them and you all share the milk.

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed.  Milk is
banned.

Pure Democracy
You have two cows. You and your neighbors decide who gets the milk.

Representative Democracy
You have two cows. Your neighbors pick someone to tell you who gets the
milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows. The government takes both and drafts you into the army.

European Democracy
You have two cows.  The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding
and
milking apply. If there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to
milk the cows. They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the
milk down the drain. They then require you to fill out forms accounting for
the missing cows.

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.  After
the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president. The cows
sue you for breach of contract. Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.

Capitalism
You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull. Your herd multiplies, and
the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the income.

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.  You sell three of them to your publicly listed company,
using
letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute
a debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get
all four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk
rights of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman
Island company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the
rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual report
says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Cover title: Enron's Cutthroat Culture 
*******************************************************************************************************************************************************************

How Enron Blew It 
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>> 
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me.""

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 

You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.

""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.

""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

"Now at merckmedco.com (tm)  -- more convenient home delivery!","Now you can enjoy the benefits of convenient online ordering and home
delivery for medications that you take on an ongoing basis - even if
you currently fill these prescriptions at your local retail pharmacy.

Recent enhancements to merckmedco.com now make it even easier for you
to see which of your prescriptions can be filled through Merck-Medco's
Home Delivery Pharmacy.

When you choose to refill a prescription through home delivery, you can:
* Enjoy at-home prescription delivery and the convenience of online
  ordering anytime, from any computer with Internet access.
* Receive a larger days' supply of medication -- usually up to 90
  days -- which saves you trips to the drugstore and in some cases,
  saves you money.
* Check prescription order status, pricing and coverage online.
* Receive e-mails notifying you of your prescription order status.

To see which prescriptions may be eligible for home delivery, simply:
* Click on this link or copy it into your browser window:
  https://host1.merck-medco.com/cgi-bin/Br.cgi?-PW-MyRxRtTb
* Then log in using your email address and password.
* After you click on the ""login"" button, you'll be presented with our
  ""Retail Prescriptions"" area, where you can see a detailed history of
  recent prescriptions you filled at a retail pharmacy.

Any medication with a little blue house next to it indicates that the
prescription is eligible for home delivery. When you click on the blue
house, you can compare your current co-payment with the savings you would
receive if you choose home delivery.  If you decide that you would like
to take advantage of home delivery savings, we contact your healthcare
provider and keep you informed every step of the way via e-mail.

Subject:	Limit Order Wash Trades

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.

"Patient but Not Passive","A colleague has sent you this article from Fortune (http://www.fortune.com ).
Reply to your colleague at janette.elbertson@enron.com 
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
MOST POWERFUL WOMEN IN BUSINESS
Patient but Not Passive
A new kind of leader emerged in our annual ranking of powerful businesswomen. She is strong and resolute, but not in a hurry. 
Patricia Sellers
Mon Oct 15 00:00:00 EDT 2001
For some 30 years--ever since women started jockeying for power in the  workplace--patience has gotten a bad rap. After all, the virtue fairly  reeks of a Victorian mission to corset women into the role of submissive  wife and mother. So women have shunned it. Instead they have felt the  need to make bold pronouncements and rush to action. That was never  truer than during the season of dot-com mania, when every CEO professed  to be leading a revolution. And any leader who failed to act quickly was  supposed to get trampled by the capitalist vanguard.  
Now, in these new, more tempered times, patience may be about to reap  its reward. In FORTUNE's annual survey of the 50 Most Powerful Women in  Business, we see the emergence of women who came to power slowly. We're  not talking about women who had the patience to suffer indignities or  who sat passively in an out-of-the-way corner. Rather, they stayed with  a company, steadily building influence there, and rose to power through  determination and insider knowledge, not promises and self-promotion.  These qualities, of course, serve men as well as women. Jim Collins,  author of Good to Great, argues that the most successful corporate  turnarounds were led by such colorless men as Darwin Smith at  Kimberly-Clark and William Allen at Boeing. Through a combination of  deep knowledge of the corporation, personal humility, and will, they  created enduring greatness. It's too early to say whether Anne Mulcahy,  No. 6 on our list, can pull off such a feat. But she fits the profile.  An unpretentious workhorse who never aimed to be CEO, she felt  ambivalent accepting the title at troubled Xerox in July. ""I'm not as  famous as Carly--and I want to keep it that way,"" says Mulcahy, 48. 
The famous Carly--Hewlett-Packard Chairman and CEO Carleton Fiorina--is  still No. 1 on our list, as she has been every year since we began  publishing the The Power 50 in 1998. She still heads the biggest company  ($48.8 billion in revenues last year) run by a woman. And she is still  as audacious and impatient as ever. Wall Street practically heckled her  latest move--a bold bet to buy competitor Compaq--but Fiorina, 47,  remains defiant. In difficult times ""people who drive change are the  subject of great scrutiny,"" she says. As a woman--and a daring,  outspoken one at that--her actions are scrutinized more closely than the  most driven of men. Says Fiorina: ""I've had a lot of male CEOs say to  me, 'Thank God they don't rank us.' ""  
PepsiCo President and CFO Indra Nooyi (No. 10) understands the urge to  take bold action, but she also knows the necessity of holding back.  ""There is no question that women who reach the top have to perform at a  higher level--which is why women tend to push themselves harder than  men,"" says Nooyi, 46. ""But we have to have the right people around who  can say to us, 'You're draining the organization. You're pushing too  hard.' "" Particularly now, as the U.S. prepares for an uncertain kind of  war and enters what could be a sustained economic downturn, power seems  to call for pragmatic and careful leadership. 
This year's Power 50 is full of such steady leaders. Mulcahy, Nooyi, and  the other corporate women who are new to the top ten this year--Mirant's  Marce Fuller (No. 5), Pfizer's Karen Katen (No. 7), Chevron's Pat Woertz  (No. 8), and Kraft's Betsy Holden (No. 9)--are all low-profile  loyalists. The combined tenure at their current companies: 118 years.  The six years Andrea Jung (No. 4) spent as head of marketing at Avon  gave her the knowledge to revive the troubled company faster than anyone  expected when she became CEO two years ago (see It Took a Lady to Save Avon ).  
As always, the list is a snapshot of power at a moment in time. Last  year, power resided in the technology and Internet sectors, but that  influence was fleeting. Gone from the list this year: ""Hurricane Debby""  Hopkins, who pushed her agenda too ambitiously at Lucent and lost her  CFO job in May; Ellen Hancock, who failed at the startup Exodus; and  Morgan Stanley's Mary Meeker, who influenced so many to buy into the  Internet fizz. But one Web warrior looks better than ever: eBay's Meg  Whitman, No. 2 on our list. Whitman, who at times took heat for not  managing aggressively enough, has never overpromised investors; instead  she has diligently delivered above-target profits every single  quarter.
While the economy and its points of power change, the definition we use  to evaluate power remains the same. We consider the size and importance  of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her  company, and the arc of her career--where she has been and where she is  likely to go. When appropriate, we also weigh the woman's influence on  mass culture and society. That factor lifts Oprah Winfrey to No. 3 on  this year's list. She owns a product, The Oprah Winfrey Show, that  generates more than $300 million in annual revenues and reaches 26  million viewers in the U.S. each week--plus millions more in 106  international markets. Her show, and now her magazine, O, The Oprah  Magazine (whose subject is personal empowerment), have immense influence  on the popular culture--from what books people read to what kind of  lives they lead.  
The shifts on our list this year are dramatic, with 14 newcomers and  three returnees from previous years. But one trend is especially  intriguing: Women are taking on bigger businesses than ever. A few years  ago responsibility for a $3 billion business almost automatically earned  a woman a spot on this list. No more. (Unless she wields media power  like Martha Stewart, No. 13.) This year's FORTUNE 50 includes several  women who lead businesses with annual revenues of $20 billion or more.  That's a first. The ranking has become so competitive, in fact, that  some women moved down even though their power increased. Example: Shelly  Lazarus. She heads a healthy business, ad giant Ogilvy & Mather (where,  by the way, she has worked for 30 years), whose revenues grew 20% last  year. Plus, she added a prestigious board seat--General Electric--to her  resume. But in order to make room for newcomers, Lazarus slides to No.  11, from No. 7 last year. 
One newcomer is Southwest Airlines President Colleen Barrett (No. 20).  Loyalty and self-knowledge took Barrett to corporate heights she never  imagined while growing up in tiny Bellows Falls, Vt.  Barrett couldn't  afford to go to a four-year college and had no specific ambition beyond  believing she ""would be the best legal secretary in the world,"" she  says. Barrett started as Herb Kelleher's secretary in 1967, a decade  before he quit a Texas law practice to launch Southwest Airlines. She  made an indelible mark as the startup grew to be America's  top-performing airline. In her job as executive vice president of  customers, she helped create Southwest's famously collegial culture and  provided essential structure and discipline to Kelleher's grand vision.  ""I've never wanted the CEO job,"" says Barrett. ""I don't think I have the  talents for it. I'm a great No. 2 person."" Now 57, Barrett is exactly  where she wants to be.  
Loyalty does not mean kowtowing. The women on our list push their  companies to change and grow, and they take personal risks. ""Women have  to take a lot of risks because there is no natural career progression,""  says Mirant CEO Marce Fuller. She should know. Fuller was getting great  marks running international project development for Mirant's former  parent, Southern, in 1994, when her boss asked her to take charge of the  company's tiny North American power plant operations. After looking  closely at the business, she told her boss she didn't want the job  unless she could do something altogether new--build a high-tech  risk-management and marketing organization to complement the expansion  of power plants in the U.S. ""I told him, 'If you don't have this piece,  you don't have a game plan,' "" she says. It wasn't an easy sell. Only 35  at the time, Fuller lobbied Southern's board for approval. Once she got  it, she built a 600-person energy trading and marketing unit that is  expected to generate $25 billion in revenues this year. Southern, a  regulated utility, spun off Mirant last spring. So now Fuller is her own  boss--and, with Mirant sure to be among America's largest companies this  year, a FORTUNE 500 CEO. 
One of the few. The grim news is that there are only six women CEOs of  FORTUNE 500 companies, including Fuller. And there are fewer women in  the pipeline than anyone would have thought 30 years ago. ""When I was  21, I was expecting that by this point we'd be in the fifty-fifty  range,"" says Betsy Bernard (No. 23), CEO of AT?Consumer. The reality,  though disappointing, has motivated Bernard to become ""a catalyst,  making sure that other women get opportunities."" Bernard, 46, and other  women emerging now are not based on the old model--the shark-like Linda  Wachner, whose company, Warnaco, crashed into bankruptcy this year. Or  the flamboyant Jill Barad, who was booted from Mattel last year. Says  PepsiCo's Indra Nooyi: ""PepsiCo, which used to be known for hiring  'Pepsi pretty'--blond, blue-eyed males--has made an Indian woman its  president. That says a lot about the future of women."" Let's hope Nooyi  is right. Meantime, if you don't see a new Wonder Woman in corporate  America, it doesn't mean she doesn't exist. She might be quietly and  diligently doing her job.

"Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion, Nov. 20.....","RSVP REQUESTED -- RSVP REQUESTED

You are invited to participate in a Greenhouse Gas Strategy Discussion on November 20 to explore commercial opportunities related to greenhouse gas emissions markets.  Several groups within Enron are working to monetize and integrate greenhouse-gas reduction benefits into their deals, as well as take advantage of greenhouse gas regulatory and incentive-based programs for origination, project development and risk management.

The aim of the meeting is discussion -- with minimal formal presentations.  We seek reactions to possible greenhouse gas commercial models; identification of barriers to market entry (and solutions); and ways that commercial groups across the company can enhance each other's capabilities to achieve commercial targets.

Given the range and varying circumstances under which current greenhouse gas emissions transactions are occurring, Enron business groups should:

begin to capture (define ownership and package) internal greenhouse gas reductions, 
look for opportunities to integrate greenhouse gas emissions concerns into existing risk management products, and 
Enron assets that are significant greenhouse gas emissions sources, should assess and manage exposures.  

DATE - TIME - LOCATION

Tuesday, November 20 
8:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m.
EB 8C1   

Video conference and teleconference capabilities are available.

Please see the attached agenda.  Comments on the scope and objectives of the meeting are most welcome.

Please RSVP to Kathy Mongeon, using the form below, at (kathy.mongeon@enron.com) or (202) 466-9154.  Please indicate if you would like to participate via video- or teleconference.

  Of course, our large competitors' databases have been a work in progress for generations. But, times have changed. A judicial opinion does not take on greater precedential value merely because it's fed to you via a WestLaw pipeline. It just costs more to read it. If you take a look at the searchable case law database you'll have UNLIMITED access to with TheLaw.net we stack up quite nicely, particularly when you consider the price.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/caselawgrid.htm

  By deploying TheLaw.net in your world you may discover that:

----your online productivity increases ten fold
----the list of expensive subscription items is much shorter
----it makes sense to turn to the big guns only when you cannot otherwise find the answer elsewhere, faster, cheaper.


?UNRESOLVED MANAGEMENT ISSUES

  Are you one of the select few who wants for little or nothing, or are you in a pick-and-choose mode with the overwhelming majority of your colleagues when it comes to choosing legal research resources?

     What's not to like?

--TheLaw.net is less than $1 a day for an individual annual subscription to our Solo Edition. Even less per day, per workgroup user. See, http://www.thelaw.net/susbcribe.htm

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Association of the Bar of the City of New York Calendar   THE BAR---> [IMAGE]  Teamsters Do Not Sufficiently Allege the Existence of a Pattern of Racketeering Activity  Southern District The International Brotherhood of Teamsters brought this action pursuant to the RICO Act, alleging that defendants defrauded it of funds that were used improperly to promote a defendant's 1996 candidacy for re-election as plaintiff's general president. The court dismissed plaintiff's 18 U.S.C. ?1962(c) claim, finding that plaintiff did not allege facts sufficient to support open-continuity and therefore has not sufficiently alleged the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity.

[IMAGE]  Professional Schizophrenia  Miami Daily Business Review  The American Bar Association and every state bar, except the District of Columbia, have strict rules against multidisciplinary practice, or MDP, whereby lawyers and nonlawyers partner and split fees for providing legal services. Even so, in the last few years the Big Five accounting firms have stepped up their hiring of lawyers, and the difference between what lawyers and accounting firm consultants do has become very murky.  Full text   Business Casual Backlash Texas Lawyer  The business casual backlash, it seems, has begun. No, there has not been any across-the-board rescinding of the business casual policies that in recent years have taken over the workplace. Dressing like a Gap ad was OK during boom times -- but with major firms telling workers to watch out, lest they find themselves back in pantyhose and pinstripes, ""biz cas"" may wind up as just another casualty of the down economy.

Billions of Dollars Are on the Line  The Associated Press  When two planes crashed into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, was the ghastly destruction one attack or two? SR International Business Insurance, which is responsible for 22 percent of the $3.5 billion in insurance covering the World Trade Center, has filed a suit in New York to head off any plans by the building's owners to define the assault as two attacks in order to avoid paying twice.

Subject:	Baltic Exchange changes

Please review the proposed changes(shown in blue) to the Tanker Freight products as a result of the Baltic Exchange index changes.  If we receive your approval of the change, we will make the change to the short and long description this weekend.

Tkr Freight Swap BITR BDTI 9                  Dec01           WS/mt

A financial swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays a Fixed Price in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline.  The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index.  The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001.
The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

>Tax Cuts Are the Best Stimulus
>
>
>By R. Glenn Hubbard
>
>Washington Post
>Friday, November 16, 2001; Page A47
>
>
>With most indicators of economic production, such as employment and 
>purchasing, showing further decline in October, some have argued that 
>President Bush's growth plan would have little stimulative effect. They 
>prefer the Senate Democrats' plan, on the grounds that spending is a better 
>way to revive the economy.
>
>Permit me to differ. The president's plan, included in the stimulus plan 
>passed by the House, addresses the nation's underlying economic problems. 
>If enacted, the tax cuts will quickly deliver a boost to move the economy 
>back toward its long-run growth path. The plan, it is estimated, would 
>result in 300,000 more jobs and add half a percentage point to the 2002 
>growth rate.
>
>Here's how tax cuts help stimulate the economy. Tax cuts for individuals 
>give them more money to spend and invest. Tax cuts for business for three 
>years -- long enough to have a serious effect -- would make investment less 
>expensive, so businesses would be encouraged to buy equipment, increase 
>production and expand employment.
>
>It is a major fallacy to praise new spending plans as ""stimulus."" This 
>ignores the fact that a dollar spent by the government is one fewer that 
>can be spent by private businesses. Furthermore, new spending programs 
>almost never go away, and they lead to more inflexible regulation of the 
>economy. New spending programs are not only unlikely to make the economy 
>grow, they also are an undesirable response to terrorism risks.
>
>Instead, it is important to take advantage of the flexibility and 
>innovation of the private sector. This will reduce the negative effects on 
>job growth as part of our necessary response to terrorism.
>
>The real underlying economic problem is that the terrorist attacks took a 
>direct toll on the economy and, more important, on the confidence of 
>American households and firms. The combined effect tipped a fragile rate of 
>economic growth into negative territory. But the attacks did not undermine 
>long-term productivity growth, so economic fundamentals remain strong.
>
>The challenge is simply to restore the health of the economy quickly. And 
>Congress needs to do so in the way that will be most beneficial. Assistance 
>for dislocated workers is important, and the president has already proposed 
>an aggressive package to provide it. But spending should not be confused 
>with economic stimulus.
>
>The basic source of uncertainty and loss of consumer confidence is fear 
>over job loss, and the fact is that additional spending, even on 
>unemployment insurance won't give people jobs. Indeed, the excessive 
>expansion of unemployment insurance proposed by the Senate would actually 
>increase unemployment, because it would discourage job applicants from 
>accepting new positions. Moreover, the Senate bill would err by raising 
>taxes on employers -- exactly the wrong thing to do at this moment.
>
>Until one addresses the underlying source of the uncertainty, there will be 
>no guarantee that hemorrhaging federal dollars will do any good. Lower tax 
>rates are the best way to create jobs and make large and small businesses 
>grow. Acceleration of future tax cuts, which Congress has already chosen, 
>will help the economy.
>
>Despite the repeated claim that only poor households will spend additional 
>income, evidence indicates almost all households spend about the same 
>percentage of their tax cuts. Business tax relief is essential because it 
>encourages firms to expand investment and employment. With tax cuts, firms 
>would be able to replace existing machines with more productive ones, 
>precisely the kind of change that frees up funds to hire more workers.
>
>The economy needs help now. The president wants to create more jobs, while 
>the Senate proposes new entitlements. If you were unemployed, which would

Subject:	Baltic Exchange changes

Please review the proposed changes(shown in blue) to the Tanker Freight products as a result of the Baltic Exchange index changes.  If we receive your approval of the change, we will make the change to the short and long description this weekend.

Tkr Freight Swap BITR BDTI 9                  Dec01           WS/mt

A financial swap Transaction with Enron North America Corp. under which the Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays a Fixed Price in each case in respect of the Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period, provided that, if the term of the Transaction is less than one calendar month, the Determination Period shall be the term of the Transaction. The Fixed Price shall be equal to the Flat Rate (as defined below) multiplied by the percentage submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline.  The Notional Quantity per Determination Period shall be the volume submitted by Counterparty via EnronOnline. The Floating Price shall be the Index.  The Payment Date shall be the fifth Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.
The term of the Transaction shall be from the Effective Date (or start date) to the Termination Date (or end date). The Effective Date (or start date) is 01 Dec 2001. The Termination Date (or end date) is 31 Dec 2001.
The Index shall be the arithmetic average of the prices in the Determination Period. Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

[IMAGE]   O Pioneers!  Corporate Counsel Before the country united in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, embryonic stem cell research was one of its most divisive issues. But far from the bitter debate over embryos, there is great hope for stem cells taken from another source: mature, or ""adult,"" tissue. The U.S. is home to several pioneering enterprises racing to produce adult stem cell medicine, but finding it to be an uphill battle.

What Enron Did Right

By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner. Messrs. Bodily and Bruner are professors at the University of Virginia's Graduate School of Business Administration.
This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires), competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.
Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements were all a mirage.
We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.
?	Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business. 
Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S., and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough deregulation.
?	Innovation and the ""deintegration"" of power contracts. Under the old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer. 
To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc., and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph Schumpeter called the ""process of Creative Destruction."" But creative destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be part of Enron's problem today.
?	Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended the logic of deintegration to other industries. An integrated paper company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms. Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of ""customers"" and ""suppliers."" Enron envisioned creating free markets for components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the economy. 
?	Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use, and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value for both customers and suppliers. 
?	Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver. 
The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite, counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.
?	A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal, slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm. 
Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs. This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.
Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.
The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

"Deseret Financial Swap:  Please review","Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve

"Data Services Agreement","Lisa -

Attached is a Data Services Agreement between EOL and CommodityLogic.  This agreement is intended to lay out the terms under which EOL will be providing the on-line transaction data to CommodityLogic for subsequent delivery to Enron customers.  I have not completed some of the technical aspects of the Schedules, but, rather, have left them to be determined by the appropriate EOL/CommodityLogic personnel.  I have also left the pricing blank as it was my understanding that this was being determined by Brad and Tom Gros.  This agreement is intended to go along with the waiver and consent document I previously provided.

Please look over the attached at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.  Please feel free to forward this to Savita or Brad as you deem applicable.

Thanks.

"Today's Events","The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.

"(01-350) Copper Options Expiration Operational Procedures","Notice No. 01-350
October 22, 2001



TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and 			Clearing Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Copper (HX
X1) is Friday, October 26, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.

TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm)

Trading in the November 2001 Copper Options Contract will cease at 1:00 P.M.
on October 26, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their Clearing
Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by 3:00 P.M.


On Friday, October 26, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Friday's submissions and processing will be
available on Monday morning October 29, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

"(01-389) On-Going Air Quality Testing","Notice # 01-389
November 19, 2001

TO:
All Members, Staff and Occupants of One North End Avenue

FROM:
Vincent Viola, Chairman
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:
On-Going Air Quality Testing


Air Quality Update
Air quality testing within One North End Avenue has been and will continue
to be the first priority of this Exchange.  As we previously indicated, the
Exchange has engaged Ambient Group, Inc., an extremely reputable independent
laboratory specializing in this area, to monitor the Exchange's air quality.
The Exchange has also taken a pro-active approach on testing for dangerous
chemicals outside the building.  Air quality tests were performed on
September 14th, 20th, 26th, October 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 30th,
November 6th,  8th and, to date, all results have been well below the EPA,
OSHA, ASHREA, and ACGIH levels.

The air samples collected were tested for over 300 types and/or isomers of
chemicals including transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for asbestos
structures, polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, Acenaphtene, Acenaphthylene,
Anthracence, Benz (a) anthracene, Benz (a) pyrene, Benzo (b) fluorathene,
Benzo (ghi) perylene, Benzo (k) fluoranthene, Chrysene, Dibenz (a,h)
anthracene, Fluoranthene, Flourene, Indeno (1,2,3 cd) pyrene, Napthalene,
Phenanthrene, Pyrene, Cadmium, Chromium, Copper, Iron, Lead, Manganese,
Nickel, Silica and Zinc.

Ambient Group, Inc., has also secured a high-volume air sampling monitor
that tested for air borne chemicals outside the building including
chlorinated dioxins, PCBs, brominated dioxims and polycyclic hydrocarbons
(PAHs).  The results from these reports indicated that the levels of these
individual compounds are below their respective standards and guidelines.

All test results are posted and made available to all building occupants on
a weekly basis.

Should you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Elliot
Zuckerman, Property Manager, at (212) 299-2242.

"Lotus Notes-Status Choices","Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its ""executed"" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the ""executed"" status bar:

1.  ""executed""
2.  ""executed-under amendment"" - to be used when we are amending a master
3.  ""executed-inactive"" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it
4.  ""executed-master upgrade"" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master
5.  ""executed-master netting agreement"" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement

Thanks for your attention herewith.

"RE: 2002 IT Budgets","Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Audrea,

I have checked with our legal and credit departments. Enron hereby grants PCS Nitrogen permission to discuss the swap positions between Enron and PCS with Bank of America.   These discussions are for the purpose of working towards a transaction whereby B of A would step in between Enron and PCS in regards to any natural gas swaps and options positions that you currently have in place with Enron.

To:	St. Clair, Carol; Taylor, Mark E (Legal)
Subject:	FW: Master Agreement - Form

Thank y'all so much for your help on this.  We are trying to improve the language relating to the termination payment (Section 5.4) in the bandwidth trading master.  The old version had a very complicated and repetitive formula that tried to reflect replacement costs but in practice did not do so (I will not go into why here).  Based on some ISDA materials sent to me by Elizabeth Sager, as well as the benefit of the trading forms in some of our other businesses, we have come up with the  attached.  I would be so grateful if you could give me some feedback on this 5.4 as soon as you can because we are a bit strapped in producing agreements.  

As I mentioned to Mark on the phone today, I am also trying to work out how critical is the provision allowing for payment by the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party.  As we know, most of the time a non-defaulting party would not elect to terminate if they thought they were going to have to make a payment, but given our strictly physical, not overly liquid market at the moment, this provision has the old time telecoms companies with their eyeballs swivelling around in their sockets (of course the agreement as a whole is a bit of a shock to them, but this seems to be the provision they cannot get their brains around).  Although I am not necessarily suggesting we take this feature out of the form, I would just like your thoghts on whether we have any flexibility to delete it where necessary.

Finally, I note that our form does not have any provision to suspend delivery if the buyer is not paying.  Again, given the physical delivery character of this market, I would recommend we add such a feature.

I will anxiously await your feedback...And again, many thanks.

Brent,

Please review the attached suggested changes to the assignment agreement.  I have made changes to only one of the agreements, but I assume that any changes designated below will be made to both agreements.  Broadly speaking, my changes are designed to accomplish the following:

1.	We want to characterize the Chricicahua LLCs as ""Purchasers"" to the extent possible and not an assignor.  Much of the redefined terms seek to accomplish that objective.
2.	The stated intent of Chircahua is to ""invest"" in the Transactions.  This language tries to bolster our argument that Chiricahua is wanting to invest in the weather derivatives market but in so doing it is not acting as a market maker with customers in these instruments.

I have no changes to the Master Agreement and expect that we want to minimize any changes to the extent possible.  I am happy, however, that we are trying to execute separate masters and not simply amend ENA's existing master.

Bret Wells

Subject:	Chiricahua Assignments

I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need to assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These two entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intended that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions directly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a term that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is that some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chiricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December and the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the process to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal in broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process please call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement, legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspective.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA trades to Chiricahua III and V entities.  

 

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be entered into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These are based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be delivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolutions passed?



I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into between the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or the document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the document by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Chiricahua III


Chiricahua V


Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentation.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or process of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.

Regards,
Brent

Usage at default: The newest weapon in the battle for rational
pro rata

Following the blowout on Compass Mineral's B term loan, institutional hot money
may be back - at least for the right credits. While this is a very, very good thing for the
continuation of the leveraged loan market, the question remains whether it is a good
thing for pro rata lenders already suffering from a risk/return mismatch.
A
 n oversubscription in the primary market is big news considering the past two
months: Following the events of September 11, prices on transactable loans in the
secondary market tumbled and investors found secondary yields to be far more
rewarding than those in the primary market.

Suddenly, loans in the primary market could not get done. This realization was
followed by a rash of upward flexes, original issue discount loans and LIBOR floors.
The focus was squarely on fixing the ""institutional problem""; the ""pro rata problem""
was hardly discussed.

But despite taking a backseat in lender discourse, the pro rata problem remains.
Even as institutional appetite fell by the wayside and struggling deals increased their
pro rata tranches at the expense of floundering institutional facilities, the economics
of lending remain skewed away from banks.

That is not to say that pro rata syndication technology has not evolved: Revolvers have
been shrunk to their absolute minimum. And while rumors of its death may be
exaggerated, the term loan A has almost been dropped from the pro rata equation
and replaced with a term loan B that can be sold to both banks and institutions.

U.S. bank deals to watch

THAT SINKING FEELING

Enron Corp.'s (BBB-/Baa3 Sr. Unsec. Debt; Neg. CreditWatch) growing woes
provided much food for thought before an abridged work week headed for the
Thanksgiving holiday. News of an impending debt repayment of $690 million
pummeled last week not only the value of outstanding Enron debt, but it also
highlighted growing doubts about its takeover by Dynegy Inc. Simply put, a default by
Enron on its debt obligations would leave many lenders sitting on a sizable chunk of
bad debt. For the bank loan market, Enron's quagmire poses rather unpalatable
scenarios. Of course for some banks there will be pressure to hold on to their
exposure, but for many others the challenge will be to find a tolerable market clearing
price that will allow them to shed their exposure.

A LEVERAGED LOAN PIPELINE?

According to several market observers, the window to bring to market a new
leveraged deal (if one exists) is only going to be open for two more weeks at the
most. Therefore, claims by many bankers that the only thing keeping them busy
besides amendments and waivers are deals for 2002 sound extremely credible.
T
 ake for instance Northwest Natural Gas' $2.1 billion loan package backing its
acquisition of Portland General Electric. The deal promising $800 million
institutional paper is expected to hit market at the earliest by the second quarter of
2002 once regulatory approval is in hand. The lead banks have already firmed the
deal structure and are in the process of rounding up pro rata support. The $2.1 billion
package will be distributed at both the holding and operating company level of the
combined NW Natural/PGE entity. At the holding company level, which is expected to
be rated investment grade or near-investment grade, the facilities total $1.65 billion,
including a six-year pro rata deck, split into a $100 million revolver and a $300 million
term loan A. The remainder of the holdco facilities is an $800 million institutional
deck, split into a $500 million, 7.5-year term loan B and a $300 million, 8.5-year term
loan C. The balance of the holdco deck is a $450 million capital markets facility. The
remainder of the financing package will be at the operating company level, which is
expected to retain a full investment grade profile. This $450 million deck runs for six
years and consists of a $150 million revolver for NW Natural and a $300 million
revolver for Portland General.

IN THE MEANTIME

Before the year fizzles out, there will be some deals too keep an eye open for.
Besides a prospective refinancing for Paragon Trade Brands, a new deal is rumored
for media concern Fisher Communications. On the high-grade front Pitney Bowes
soon is expected to approach its banks for a reduced rollover, while mortgage lender
Countrywide Funding preps a $4 billion refinancing package with a sizable multi-year
revolver.

--------------------------------------

High-Yield Bonds

Junk bond mutual funds summoned $628.5 million of new cash in the week ended
Tuesday, according to AMG Data Services, sending the funds about $700 million
above their pre-attack levels. The funds lost nearly $1.6 billion of investment in the
weeks following the terrorist attacks before registering their first uptick in
mid-October.

Heavily indebted cosmetics giant Revlon Consumer Products sold an upsized $363
million issue of four-year senior notes (Caa1/B-), helped along by a 920 bps spread
over Treasuries attracted enough investor attention to raise the sale from an original
$250 million, but bank sources declined to say how well books were filled out.

Meanwhile, books on the Veterinary Centers of America's $170 million note sale
were nearly seven times subscribed, directly contrasting the concurrent and
foundering $182 million IPO. The size of the Goldman Sachs-led sale was increased
from $150 million of the 144A senior subordinated notes (B3/B-) at pricing.
T
 he eight-year issue, sold under the company's Vicar Operating subsidiary, priced to
yield 502 bps over Treasuries.

Forward calendar volume appears to be building with bank sources indicating that
the endgame for 2001 is going to be fairly busy, especially as compared to the fourth
quarter's sluggish performance so far. Ingles Markets heads out on the road
tomorrow with a $200 million deal with Radiologix, Huntsman Corp., Nextel Partners
and Tommy Hilfiger soon to follow, sources say.

Deutsche Bank has the mandate for a $250 million placement for television station
operator Young Broadcasting, but the deal is subject to a successful consent
solicitation that expires tomorrow at 5 p.m.

Majestic Star Casino and Global Auto Logistics still are on the road, with pricing
expected this week.

-----------------------------------

Secondary

Last week's holiday-shortened period produced scant trading activity. As new issue
flow continues to disappoint, the secondary market necessarily remains focused on
outstanding supply. Recently, dealers have had their hands full with paydown
situations.

THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK: LYONDELL

Lyondell Chemical's term loan E spiked roughly three points last week to change
hands near par in retail trading on Wednesday, according to sources. The surge was
sparked by word of a proposed $750 million senior secured note offering slated to
repay the bulk of the TLE outstandings, as well as all of the company's remaining
TLB, sources add.

The TLE, however, is non-call until next May, when the call opens at 102 (the call
steps down to 101 in 2004 and the facility is callable at par thereafter), and therefore
a paydown would require an amendment to the credit agreement unless Lyondell
were to solicit a tender offer - a popular bond market method that has never been
employed in the syndicated loan mart, according to sources.

Today, dealers are quoting Lyondell's TLE in the roughly 100-101 range, with
speculation buzzing that the company may try to pay down most or all of the $800
million-plus tranche in the 101 area. As cyclical worries hit chemical credits in
September, Lyondell's TLE dipped as low 93 in street trading - more than 11 points
off its impressive 104.125 high set last year. As of early last week, however, bids had
strengthened soundly into the mid-90s, as dropping oil prices stirred up some hope
for the beleaguered chemical industry.

The prior week's paydown play, Allied Waste, held strong last week, as a small slug
of B/C traded last Monday at 99. Today, with nearly 20% of the company's term debt
set to be repayed, Allied's B/C paper traded up to 99.125+, as a $2.5 million and $3.7
million stub changed hands in the street.

Allied's second senior note offering of the year upsized on Nov. 15 to $750 million,
and is expected to take out nearly 20% of the company's A, B and C term loans,
leaving roughly $3 billion of term debt outstanding.

On the stressed side, after trading in the high 70s early the week prior, Xerox Corp.'s
bank debt changed hands as high as 87 last Tuesday, in reaction to an
announcement the previous Friday that the company intends to repay existing debt
with proceeds from a now $900 million (up from an initial $500 million) convertible
trust preferred securities offering. The sale will help shore up Xerox's balance sheet,
and will offer some cushion against a possible loan covenant violation, sources note.

Middle Market

""It's never been more dead,"" said one source achingly, while hopefully anticipating a
better deal flow for next year. Across the hall at the workout desks, however, activity is
ripe with action. The source added dryly, ""Those guys, meanwhile, are busy
amending deals and scrutinizing collateral.""

The time is not ripe for any one particular type of deal that could potentially have
investors salivating. But amidst the syndication melee, some deals have managed to
cross the ""scary"" hurdles. San Diego, Calif.-based Harvest Meat Co. closed a $40
million asset-based revolver with TransAmerica Business Capital. The credit has a
$6 million sublimit for letters of credit and includes a $750,000 fixed asset real estate
term loan.

The five-year revolver is priced at LIB+200. The term loan - which is non-amortizing for
the first 18 months - is priced at LIB+275, with a 175 bps LC fee. Closing fees are
$100,000, and there is a 37.5 bps commitment fee on the revolver.

Fleet Capital, meanwhile, has provided a $75 million asset-based credit backing the
buyout of Houston-based Igloo Products Corp. by Westar Capital.

Westar, a private investment firm that also owns Del Monte Foods, home healthcare
firm Apria Healthcare and Doskocil Manufacturing, is purchasing the Igloo Products
unit from Lake Forest, Ill.-based Brunswick Corp.

As with the previous two deals and the Nutraceutical International deal, security is
paramount. Nutraceutical's recently-launched $60 million, five-year credit with sole
lead arranger and administrative agent Rabobank is secured by substantially all of
the company's assets, sources noted.

Opening pricing is at LIB+175 for the first 90 days. At that time, pricing switches to an
undisclosed leverage-based grid. The commitment fee on the revolver is 35 bps.
Commitments are due by Nov. 30, with the lead seeking $15 million and $10 million
tickets from a small group consisting largely of the company's existing bank group.

===================================
Twelve Safer Equity Fund Bets
By Steve Wagner
===================================


The objective of this monthly screen is to identify what we're
calling safer bets for different equity investment objectives.
By safer we don't mean that they can't lose money in any short-
term period.  Equity mutual funds in general have greater risk
(are more volatile) than bond funds and money market funds but
have greater long-term return potential.  What we're providing
here are the more conservative best bets within each objective,
those that have produced competitive results with minimal risk
and volatility relative to other funds with the same objective.

These funds are geared to the average mutual investor who wants
to participate in the equity market and is willing to give up a
little upside potential to sleep better at night.  Each of them
has Value Line's highest overall score of '1' as well as a risk
score of '2' or better (low risk).  Each fund also sports a low
expense ratio in relation to their equity objective peers and a
low initial fund investment of $3,000 or less.

Since return and risk should be considered in light of a fund's
investment objective, we break down our safe fund bets in four
different equity objectives: growth, growth and income, income,
and balanced.  Each objective is equity-oriented but varies in
terms of their emphasis on growth or income.  Mutual investors
interested in any one of these funds should do their own 'due
diligence' to ensure that the fund meets their investment goal
and comfort with risk.  No one mutual fund fits all investors.


Growth Objective
----------------

Growth funds seek to provide long-term capital appreciation by
investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks.  Current
income, if considered at all is a secondary concern.  Three low
risk best bets with growth objectives are as follows:

Fidelity Dividend Growth      (FDGFX)
Gabelli Asset                 (GABAX)
Tweedy, Browne American Value (TWEBX)

Tweedy, Browne American Value (5-Year Avg 12.3%, +1.5% S&P 500)
buys common stocks with very low price multiples, and since its
1994 inception has consistently maintained a mid-cap value bias.
Due to the low price risk of its holdings, the fund's risk score
is as excellent as its returns, says Morningstar.  They also say
that its returns look especially good after taxes.

Gabelli Asset (5-Year Avg 13.8%, +2.9% S&P 500) also likes the
mid-cap sector, and over the past five years has moved between
value and blend styles.  Its value approach and diversification
across industries and issuers helps limit risk, per Morningstar.
Its top-notch returns are the result of great stock picking and
willingness to play bold themes, according to Morningstar.

Fidelity Dividend Growth (5-Year Avg 15.7%, +4.9% S&P 500) also
blends value and growth stocks but prefers to fish in large-cap
waters where the fund can fulfill its mandate of holding growth
companies which exhibit potential for dividend growth.  Its low
risk profile results from its avoidance of volatile tech stocks,
in addition to tight risk controls.  Strong research and equity
selection, Fidelity trademarks contribute to an excellent long-
term performance record.


Growth & Income Objective
-------------------------

Growth and income funds seek long-term growth of capital, plus
income from dividends.  They typically select equities for both
their appreciation potential and dividend-paying ability.  Three
low risk best bets with growth and income objectives are listed
below:

Dodge & Cox Stock                  (DODGX)
Jensen Fund                        (JENSX)
T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (PRWCX)

T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation (5-Year Avg 12.5%, +1.7% S&P
500) specializes in finding opportunities among securities that
the market has overly punished for various reasons.  It invests
in common stocks believed to be undervalued by various measures,
such as price/book and establishes relatively large positions in
those companies it finds particularly attractive.  The fund also
invests in fixed income securities and convertibles to give it a
risk-adverse profile.

Dodge & Cox Stock (5-Year Avg 15.3%, +4.4% S&P 500) also has a
value approach but invests primarily in the large-cap sector.
Through the years, it has consistently maintained a large-cap
value bias.  Like the other value funds profiled, the lower price
risk of its holdings contributes to its low relative risk score.
Morningstar says management's eye for fundamentally strong
companies trading at cheap prices has produced results that are
tough to argue with and you'll get no argument from me.

Jensen Fund (5-Year 13.8%, +3.0% S&P 500) invests primarily in
growth companies with long histories of delivering high returns
on equity, are in excellent financial condition and have raised
dividends in recent years.  Since its 1992 inception, the fund
has consistently maintained a large-cap growth style bias.  The
fund invests in growth stocks at a reasonable price and because
of management's focus on valuation and quality, fund volatility
has been kept low.


Income Objective
----------------

Income funds (commonly known as equity-income funds) seek income
from the dividends and interest generated by the fund's holdings.
Growth of capital is a secondary objective.  Three low risk funds
with income objectives are as follows:

American Century Equity Income (TWEIX)
Parnassus Equity Income        (PRBLX)
Van Kampen Equity Income A     (ACEIX)

American Century Equity Income (5-Year Avg 14.0%, +3.1% S&P 500)
is similar to T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation in that it buys
stock of companies that are beaten down but focuses on companies
that can quickly rebound.  Though the years, it has maintained a
mid-cap value bias.  Because it is less patient than other value
funds, portfolio turnover is higher-than-average, making it more
suited to IRA and other tax-deferred accounts.

Parnassus Equity Income (5-Year Avg 13.0%, +2.1% S&P 500) and Van
Kampen Equity Income A (5-Year Avg 13.5%, +2.7% S&P 500) are both
large-cap value oriented in management style.  Management directs
its attention toward the issues of well-established, undervalued
companies that offer potential income, consistent with safety of
principal.  Both income funds invest the majority of assets in
income-producing equities, with a portion invested in bonds and
convertibles to derive a risk-adverse portfolio.


Balanced Objective
------------------

Balanced funds seek both income and capital appreciation by
investing in a fairly static mix of stocks and bonds, with at
least 25% of portfolio assets in bond securities at all times.
Three low risk funds with balanced objectives are as follows:

Dodge & Cox Balanced    (DODBX)
Oakmark Equity & Income (OAKBX)
Thompson Plumb Balanced (THPBX)

Oakmark Equity & Income (5-Year Avg 16.5%, +5.7% S&P 500) buys
cheap mid-cap stocks of cash-rich companies for its equity stake
and government bonds and high-yield corporate securities for its
fixed income allocation.  Due to the low price risk of its stock
holdings and quirky asset mix, the fund's risk score is very low
relative to other domestic hybrids, while generating high return
for shareholders.

Dodge & Cox Balanced (5-Year Avg 12.7%, +1.9% S&P 500) uses the
same large-cap value approach followed by Dodge & Cox Stock for
the equity allocation and invests in investment-grade securities
for the fixed income stake.  This 'traditional' balanced fund is
one of the oldest funds in America with roots dating back to the
year 1931.  Morningstar calls it a category standout, generating
strong long-term results for loyal shareholders.

Thompson Plumb Balanced (5-Year Avg 14.0%, +3.1 S&P 500) uses a
combination of value and growth methods to construct a broadly
diversified portfolio of companies with strong franchises, high
returns on equity, solid long-term prospects and low valuations.
On the fixed-income side, the fund does not make large interest-
rate bets, but invests in high-quality, intermediate-term bonds.
Because it tends to allocate assets more in equities than other
balanced offerings, it is most suitable for investors primarily
favoring solid capital appreciation over income.


Summary
-------

Through the years, I've been asked to recommend 'good' mutual
funds.  These dozen funds have kept risk low by having 'tight'
risk controls and focusing on identifying value opportunities
through strong fundamental research.  Each of them have beaten
the stock market (measured by the S&P 500 index) over the past
five years, while minimizing risk relative to other funds with
the same objective.  Accordingly, they are all 'good' funds in
our opinion and safer ways to play the equity market.  Most of
them are offered on a no-load basis and come with low expenses,
adding to their overall appeal.

 We just thought we were going to get this signed. The Confirmations supervisor has some problems as outlined below. Can we fix this in the amendment?  Do you want us to send language? 
I would like to hold off executing this amendment until we can include a warranty provision (including remedies) regarding the accuracy of the ""electronic records of the EOL transactions"" . This is a result of:
?       the current EOL service agreement disclaims all warranties as to the accuracy of the website information (Sec 4.b of the service agreement)

?       the amendment in its current form does not warrant the accuracy of the electronic information, yet it will replace the confirmation, and

?       we are currently experiencing significant problems with the integrity of the data obtained from the website,  which I would have to assume would be the same data that would replace the confirmations.

I will be here and available to meet with you at your convenience today up until about 3:00 and tomorrow from 8:30 until 4:00. On Wednesday, GSS is having their quarterly business review and I have been asked to attend that.

"Institutional Investor Announces its 2001 All-America Research Te	am","
Dear Mark 
We are sending you this email as we feel this announcement, from a sister company with Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC, will be of interest to you.
From Institutional Investor Inc: 
Institutional Investor has announced the complete results of its annual All-America Research Team, the most prestigious and highly anticipated ranking of sell-side analysts in the United States profiling the top equity analysts in 79 industry sectors and investment categories.
To view which firms ranked highest in this year's survey, go to http://www.institutionalinvestoronline.com/em/  and browse the 2001 Leaders' Table:  
Salomon Smith Barney jumped from third place last year to unseat six-time winner Merrill Lynch and claimed top honors in Institutional Investor magazine's 30th anniversary All-America Research Team survey.
Salomon registered 55 total team positions to surpass second-place Credit Suisse First Boston, which had 52. Merrill Lynch recorded 51 positions. In all, analysts were rated in 79 industry sectors and investment specialties.
Members of the All-America Research Team were selected by surveying the directors of research and chief investment officers of major money management institutions, as well as other key U.S., European and Asian investors. In total, the opinions of more than 3,200 individuals were tapped.
This feature was compiled by Institutional Investor staff under the direction of Senior Editors Carolyn Sargent and Jane B. Kenney with Associate Editor Sivert Hagen and Assistant Editor Erika Ihara.
Institutional Investor, the premier financial monthly, has won 72 awards for editorial excellence in 35 years of publication.
The complete results of the All-America Research Team and the entire October editions of Institutional Investor magazine are available at IIPlatinum - http://www.iiplatinum.com/em/  - the premium web service for Institutional Investor magazine subscribers.

A Brave New Idea
If you have college tuitions to pay, retirements to fund, or
families to protect, then you have a lot of company.  How do you
invest in a market that has become so unpredictable?  These are
turbulent times. Turbulent in a different way than in economic
cycles of the past - there's more to it this time around.  What's
worked in the past won't necessarily work going forward.  And
since history tells us that the best time to invest is while market
sentiment is still down, it is crucial now more than ever to have
the right investment guide. So when the market moves, you won't get
left behind.

The Marketocracy Dream Team.
What if you could tell what the world's best investors were doing
every day?  The ability to buy what the best investors are buying,
and sell what they are selling, would be a dream come true. For
over a year, Marketocracy has been operating a web site - the
forum for an incredibly effective and proven trading and performance
tracking tool - designed to accurately measure the investment
ability of thousands of people, in order to identify the world's
most successful investors.  Currently, we follow and maintain
over 50,000 track records - more than 10 times the number of equity
funds tracked by Morningstar.  Never before has the investment
performance of so many been so accurately measured.

Tired of Advice from People that are Losing Money?
Marketocracy is based on the idea that the investors with the
greatest skills will achieve the greatest successes. The idea
that the only credential that really matters is track record.
Our m100 Index taps into the knowledge and investing strategies
of some of the best investors in the world.  Why choose a
single stock-picker to make guiding investment decisions that
must endure and remain strong over the long haul?  The m100 acts
more like a relay team, with stock-pickers passing the baton if
their performance falters, ensuring we always rely on the ""fastest
and strongest runners"" for performance. With 50,000 virtual funds,
we have access to a deep reservoir of proven investment talent
from which to choose the best performers at any given time.

Invest with Real Intelligence - Stock Selection at Peak Performance
How would you like to have 100 people as diligent as you are
covering all the areas of the market that you're not familiar with?
Marketocracy does what individual investors try to do for themselves
- continuously seeks the strategic advice of the right people at
the right time. Want to benefit from their stock picking abilities?

See For Yourself - m100 Journal Free Trial
We want to give you access to the ultimate investment tool: our
m100 Journal. The m100 Journal provides timely knowledge every
week of what many of the world's best investors are doing right
now - not last quarter, or 6 months ago - including the top buys,
sells, holdings, tips, and commentary of the m100 Index.  If you
want to look over the shoulders and benefit from some of the best,
simply hit ""reply"" to this email, and we will send you 4 free
issues of the m100 Journal, delivered to you weekly via an emailed
PDF attachment.

"FW: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.

Thanks again, NJD

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

   Albertson's, Inc., one of the largest food/drug retailers in the U.S.,
   is looking for a new General Counsel. Albertson's have been a very good
   client for the firm over the past 10 years, and if we could place
   someone there it would probably enhance our relationship.

   A description of the position and related matters is attached.

   Please give me a call if you have any ideas.

   Ted Kozloff
   ext 2600 in San Francisco.

"(01-448) EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL","Notice No. 01-448
December 28, 2001

TO:		ALL EXCHANGE MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:	J. ROBERT COLLINS, JR., PRESIDENT

RE:		EXCHANGE TO CHANGE EARLY CLOSING TIME FOR COAL

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., announced today that it will change
the early closing time for coal futures to 12:30 P.M. for days that the
Exchange has designated for early closings.

These days include December 31, 2001, and January 18; February 15; May 24;
August 30; and December 24 and 31 in 2002.

The change reflects the abbreviated trading hours under which the Exchange
has been operating since September 17 and will remain in place until the
hours are extended. All other open outcry energy markets except propane
futures will continue to cease at 1:00 P.M. on those days. Propane futures
close at 12:15 P.M.  The early closing for aluminum and palladium will
remain at noon; silver and copper will end at 12:05 PM on those days; and
gold and platinum will close at 12:10 P.M. Electricity futures will close at
its regular time of 9 A.M.

"(01-353) Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Pric	e Procedures for Copper Contracts""","Notice to Members No: 01-353
October 23, 2001

TO:		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION MEMBER FIRMS
		ALL COMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	Approved Amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94, ""Settlement Price
Procedures for Copper Contracts""


The Exchange has complied with regulatory requirements by filing with the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission amendments to COMEX Rule 4.94,
""Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts"".  The approved amendments
to Rule 4.94 modify the settlement price procedure for the current delivery
month by taking into consideration, not only the weighted average price
(rounded to the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transaction
that occur in the closing range, but also the weighted average for all
spreads executed and all spread bids and offers actively represented between
the most active month and the current delivery month during the final thirty
minutes of trading.

A copy of the amended Rule 4.94 is attached.  These Rule amendments will
become effective on Monday, October 29, 2001.

Should you have any questions please contact Michael Campanelli at
212-299-2072, Albert J. Getz at 212-299-2608 or Ploumi Efkarpidis at
212-299-2334.

Approved Rule Amendments
(Asterisk indicates additions: bracketing indicates deletions)

Rule 4.94	Settlement Price Procedures for Copper Contracts.

	(A)(i) The term ""base month"" shall mean the March, May, July,
September, and December delivery months; (ii) the term ""most active month""
with respect to this rule and the rules of COMEX Chapters 11 and 17 shall
mean the base month that is not the current delivery month, with the
greatest reported open interest on the official COMEX daily open interest
report.

* (B)   The settlement price for the current delivery month shall be
comprised of the weighted average price (rounded to the nearest minimum
fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in the closing range
combined with the weighted average price of all spreads executed between the
current delivery month and the most active month and all spread bids and
offers between the current delivery month and the most active month actively
represented during the final 30 minutes of trading.  If no outright
transactions occur in the closing range or no spreads are executed or there
are no spread bids and offers actively represented during the final 30
minutes of trading in the current delivery month, the settlement price shall
be the last trade price, unless during the closing range a bid higher or
offer lower than the last trade price is made.  In such event, such higher
bid or lower offer shall be the settlement price. *

	[(B)] *(C) *  The settlement price for the [current delivery month
and the] most active month shall be the weighted average price (rounded to
the nearest minimum fluctuation) of all outright transactions that occur in
the closing range.  If no outright transactions occur in the closing range
of [either the current delivery month and] the most active month, the
settlement price [for the applicable month] shall be the last trade price,
unless during the closing range a bid higher or offer lower than the last
trade price is made.  In such event, such higher bid or lower offer shall be
the settlement price.

	[(C)] *(D)*  In all other delivery months, the settlement prices
shall be determined based upon spread relationships between and among
contract months, which relationships shall be determined in the judgment of
the Settlement Price Committee with:  (a) greater weight given to spreads
executed late in the trading day in large volumes, and (b) lesser weight
given to (i) spreads traded in lesser volumes, (ii) spread bids and offers
actively represented late in the trading day, and (iii) spread transactions,
bids and offers from earlier in the trading day.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no settlement price shall be established that would be lower than
the best outright bid, or higher than the best outright offer, that:  (a)
was for at least 20 contracts, and (b) had been posted with the Exchange and
had remained available for execution and unfilled for the final 30 minutes
of trading of that trading day.

	[(D)] *(E)*  If any settlement price, determined pursuant to
Paragraph [(C)] *(D)*, is inconsistent with transactions that occurred
during the closing range for other delivery months of the same futures
contract or with other market information known to the Committee, the
Committee may establish a settlement price at a level consistent with such
other transactions or market information.  In such event, the Committee
shall prepare a written record of the basis for any settlement price so
established.

John,

The million or so we made in San Joaquin ERCs was booked in the SO2 book.  Do you want that moved over to the ERC book?  I just was updating our financials in the b-plan and came across that.  Jay V.  said it would not be that hard to change it.

Do you want to change it?

"(01-347) Aluminum Options Expiration Operational Procedures","Notice No. 01-347
October 19, 2001


TO:		All COMEX Division Members/Member Firms
All COMEX Division Clearing Members
All COMEX Division Floor Traders
All COMEX Division Operations Managers

FROM:	Michael Campanelli, Vice President
		Floor Operations / COMEX Division

RE:		Options Expiration Operational Procedures for the Trading
Floor and Clearing
Members - Shortened Hours
____________________________________________________________________________
__

The expiration date for the November 2001 options contract for Aluminum (OA
X1) is Thursday, October 25, 2001.

GENERAL OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

All Clearing Members and Qualified Floor Traders that carried an options
position as of the close of business day prior to the expiration day, or
engaged in trading activity on Expiration Day in the expiring options
contract will be required to have a knowledgeable, duly authorized on-line
trade entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative available until released
by the Exchange staff.  All adjustments  and/or corrections, must be
accompanied by relevant supporting documentation prior to being incorporated
into expiration processing, in essence making the expiration processing an
extension of the afternoon trade resolution procedures.

Exchange Clearing (299-2110) and Trade Processing (299-2465 and 299-2044)
personnel will be available to assist with the processing of notices of
Exercise and Abandonment, position transfers, trade corrections and other
questions or problems you may have.

Failure by any Clearing Member or qualified Floor Trader to comply with
procedures as outlined herein may result in severe disciplinary action by
the Exchange and potential financial liability to customers or members for
failure to exercise diligence in the processing of information.


TRADING FLOOR OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES


The following schedule of operational procedures is based on shortened
trading hours as described in Notice to Members # 01-333
(http://www.nymex.com/refernce/notices/2001/ntm_333.htm).

Trading in the November 2001 Aluminum Options Contract will cease at 1:05
P.M. on October 25, 2001.  All Brokers and Traders must inform their
Clearing Members of their intentions to exercise or abandon such Options by
3:00 P.M.

On Thursday, October 25, 2001, all Brokers and Clearing Members must have a
duly authorized, On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system trained representative
available until such time as the Exchange deems necessary.

NOTE:	After 3:30 P.M. all expiring option trade data must be inputted on
special ""OLTE"" terminals located in the Trade Processing Room.  Any other
means of submission will be rejected by the Exchange.  Members will be able
to submit all other trade data until 4:00 P.M.

After the Unmatched Trade Reports and the Preliminary Spot Month Matched
Trade Reports are displayed, Clearing Member representatives will be able to
pick up their Preliminary Clearing reports at the Clearing Department.

A final review of all submissions will be made.  The Supervisor of the Trade
Processing Room will detain only those Clearing Members and/or Broker
representatives involved.  All final corrections will be made at this time
and upon determination of the Supervisor that all option processing is
complete, all representatives will be released.

Exchange Reports based on Thursday's submissions and processing will be
available on Friday morning October 26, 2001.

In the event that you have any questions regarding these trading floor
procedures please contact Michael Campanelli at (212) 299-2072 or David
Sherman at (212) 299-2061.

CLEARING DEPARTMENT OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES

1.	OPEN POSITION CONFIRMATION (""OPC"") - The OPC should reflect as
accurately as possible all futures and options gross positions as of
close-of business on the business day prior to expiration.  Review the
estimated current gross positions as shown and make appropriate adjustments.
The OPC must be submitted not later than 9:00 A.M.

2.  	OPTIONS EXERCISE/ABANDONMENT REQUESTS FORM (""E/A"") - An expiring
option with a strike price in-the-money by one tick or more will be subject
to automatic exercise unless an Option Abandonment Request form is submitted
advising that a Clearing Member (""CM"") elects to abandon some or all of its
position in that strike price (i.e., for the option series).  All other
options series in the expiring month will be subject to automatic
abandonment unless an Option Exercise Request form is submitted.  When
submitting an E/A form, please note the following:

(a)	An E/A form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.
(b)	Do not submit an Exercise form for positions in strike prices which
are subject to automatic
		Exercise nor submit an Abandonment form for positions in
strike prices which are subject to automatic abandonment.
(c)	If a CM wishes to submit an E/A form to abandon a position in a
strike price subject to automatic exercise or wishes to exercise a position
in a strike price which is out of the money, it is necessary to notify
Clearing by telephone of such anticipated action.  The CM must have an
officer available to confirm such intention.
(d)	CMs may secure from Clearing a time-stamped receipt of the CM copy
to assure submission 	of the CM's E/A forms.

3.	OPTION POSITION REDUCTION REQUEST FORM (""OPRR"") - As a general rule,
purchases and sales of option contracts are presumed to be new business.
If some or all of your purchases and sales are in fact undertaken for
position liquidation purposes, OPRR forms may be submitted on the day of
expiration and will be used in conjunction with trade data to reduce your
projected position in an expiring contract.  OPRR requests in excess of
actual traded volume will be rejected.  Exception: Cabinet trades and cancel
correction trades will automatically liquidate existing positions, therefore
do not submit an OPRR form for cabinet or cancel correction trades.
The OPRR form must be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.

4.	HOUSE/CUSTOMER POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""H/C"") - H/C forms
may be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between a CM's
house and customer accounts.  Problem trades (those which have not cleared
prior to expiration day) must be corrected using COMEX's on-line trade entry
system under the direct supervision of the Trade Audits Department of COMEX
(""Trade Audits"").  The H/C form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

5.	EX-PIT POSITION TRANSFER REQUEST FORM (""Ex-Pit"") - Ex Pit forms may
be used only to transfer previously cleared contracts between CMs.  Problem
trades (those which have not cleared prior to expiration day) must be
corrected on the on-line trade entry system under the direct supervision of
Trade Audits.  The Ex-Pit form must be submitted not later than 2:30 PM.

	*****
A)	At approximately 3:15 PM, two PRELIMINARY reports of the expiration
process will be available for distribution at the NYMEX Clearing Department:
1.	OPTION EXPIRATION REPORT AND CONFIRMATION - The purpose of this
report is to project the CM's present position going into the expiration
based upon the transactions which have already been submitted to Clearing.
CMs should review and modify their adjusted gross positions as of
close-of-business on the business day prior to expiration.  Further
adjustments may be submitted not later than 4:00 PM.  The projected ending
gross positions will reflect transactions accepted or rejected for clearance
on expiration night, inclusive of Ex-Pit, H/C and OPRR transactions which
have been submitted to Clearing prior to 2:30 PM, and trade information
submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM.  Normally, this report will also
reflect manually submitted Exercise and Abandonment instructions, the
projected number of exercises and maximum potential assignments for each
strike price, the type of exercise (manual or automatic), whether the strike
is In, At or Out of the money, and the exercise value associated therewith
based on settlement prices established by COMEX on the day of expiration.

2.	TRANSACTION LISTING - This listing will include in detail all
expiring option trades submitted to COMEX prior to 2:45 PM on expiration
day, and all H/C, ExPit, OPRR and E/A transactions submitted to Clearing
Prior to 2:30 PM.

Please note: Trade information reflected on the option expiration report and
transaction listing are trades submitted only. To inquire whether trades
have matched, each CM must review the trade reports provided by COMEX's
On-Line Trade Entry (""OLTE"") system.

B)	At approximately 4:30 PM, FINAL reports of the expiration process,
including all submissions to Clearing and trade information submitted to
COMEX made by 4:00 PM, will be available for distribution at the NYMEX
Clearing Department.

C)	At 4:45 PM, Preliminary In The Money Abandonment and Out Of The
Money Exercise information will be announced on Fast Facts.

D)	At Approximately 6:30 PM, a Final Notice of Exercise/Assignments
will be available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing
Department.  Each CM which has exercised or been assigned one or more
options will receive a separate statement showing exercises and/or
assignments for each option series.  Please check this statement carefully.
Although long options positions in-the-money by one tick or more will be
automatically exercised, not all short option positions will be assigned if
there are any options manually abandoned at such strike prices.  Please note
that there also may be some at or out-of-the money options being exercised.

E)	At approximately 8:00 PM, the final set of clearing sheets will be
available in each CM's lockbox located at the NYMEX Clearing Department.

It is strongly recommended that each CM have a representative(s) that is
properly trained to handle the option expiration process available beginning
at 3:15 PM and who will receive the CM's reports at the specific times.  It
is solely the responsibility of the CM to review these reports and to notify
the Clearing staff immediately of any discrepancies.

To obtain the exact time of the availability for each report, clearing
members should call (212) 301-4871, access code 701.  The announcement time
will occur 1/2 hour prior to availability.

Attached please find a Clearing Member Procedure Summary for ease of
reference.  Please contact Anthony DiBenedetto at (212) 299-2152 or John
Ramos at (212) 299-2142 if you have any questions.
