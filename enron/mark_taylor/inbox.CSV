Kevin and Chris:

The spread looks fine except for one minor point.  I'd included a parenthetical defined term at the end fo section (A) of the product long description so that it would be clear in section (B) that Firm (LD) energy was as defined in Schedule P of the EEI agreement.  You deleted the reference.  Please include the parenthetical or give me a call to discuss leaving it out if you prefer.

Thanks,

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

I would like to get these out on Tuesday at the latest.  On the issue of the 77,500 MMbtu, I will address directly with the customer and let you know what I find out.

Richard,
To answer your first question, #326528 does not begin until Jan 1, 2002 so nothing has been billed out yet. For your second question, I agree that the 77,500 for Dec 01 of #328974 does look random. But I cannot verify anything for you besides what is in RGS. That is why we originally sent this spreadsheet to you to verify what was correct and what was incorrect in RGS. If this volume is incorrect, we need to unwind the deal in RGS immediately. Please let Russ and I know what you find out so the volumes can be fixed in RGS if needed. Thanks

Jennifer

"New Temp IDs","Since our department has grown, we have realized the need to add 3 new temporary IDs.  Following the instructions below, please add calendar access rights for EWS Legal Temp IDs 9, 10, and 11 (as show in blue below). While doing this, would you mind checking the other IDs as well to be sure they are listed.  When logging in temporaries we have discovered that some access rights work with some temp IDs, but not all.  Thank you!
================================
For Outlook users only!

Since we have migrated to Outlook, we have not been able to give calendar/e-mail access to the temporaries filling in for our department.  Apparently, the access rights we all had set up in Lotus Notes cannot be migrated to Outlook.  Thus, we need all attorneys and specialists to give access rights to all the department Temporary IDs as soon as possible.  You can control how much access you would like to give, and for what.  For example, you could give full revision access to your calendar and read-only for your e-mail or access only to your calendar and no access to your e-mail.  It's up to you.

Please give access to the following IDs:
EWS Legal Temp 1
EWS Legal Temp 2
EWS Legal Temp 3
EWS Legal Temp 4
EWS Legal Temp 5
EWS Legal Temp 6
Note:  Do not use-Temp 7 is not designated for our temporaries.
EWS Legal Temp 8
EWS Legal Temp 9
EWS Legal Temp 10
EWS Legal Temp 11

To set up access:
1.	Right click on ""Outlook Today"" at the top of the folders list (if your folders list is not visible, click on ""View"" and
	then ""Folder List"")

2.	Left Click on ""Properties"" at the bottom of the list that pops up

3.	Left click on the ""Permissions"" tab

4.	Left click on ""Add"".
	Type ""EWS""-the address list will stop on our temp IDs.
	Left click on one of the Temp ID you are adding, left click on the ""Add"" button.  Repeat for each ID.  (Be careful not
	to add EWS Temp ID 7.  This is not used for our temporaries.)
	Left Click ""OK""

5. 	You should now be back in the ""properties"" box.  Select the first ID you just added, hold down the ""Shift"" key, then

"Deseret Confirm:  Please review","Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail with your comments.

Thanks so much,

Steve

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Attention:  Kathy Moore

Kathy, thanks for your help.

The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
Cinergy and PJM West.

We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
(at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.

As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
retail customers.

By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
December 3rd.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Thanks again for your help.

I would like to hold off executing this amendment until we can include a warranty provision (including remedies) regarding the accuracy of the ""electronic records of the EOL transactions"" . This is a result of:
?       the current EOL service agreement disclaims all warranties as to the accuracy of the website information (Sec 4.b of the service agreement)

?       the amendment in its current form does not warrant the accuracy of the electronic information, yet it will replace the confirmation, and

?       we are currently experiencing significant problems with the integrity of the data obtained from the website,  which I would have to assume would be the same data that would replace the confirmations.

The key question will be whether we can get a QSPE [which is supposed to be brain dead] to amend a document to accomplish this. Section 6.2(c) of Swee'P, L.L.C.'s LLC Agreement provides that:

""(c)	The Principal Managers of the Company, or any one of them, are hereby, and without further action, expressly authorized to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Company, the Transaction Documents, together with (i) any amendments, modifications, or supplements thereto, and restatements thereof, as such Principal Managers, or any one of them, may deem appropriate,""

Alan, lets talk when you have a chance.  [What I would envision is an amendment to the Transfer Agreement that carves out certain account obligors referred to on a schedule from the definition of Receivables -- so we could revise the schedule from time to time as other master netting agreements are executed, and a similar revision to the UCC financing statements.] JNE

Not being aware of all the ins and outs of your transaction, but based upon the description below and the provisions of the master netting agreement, I think the receivables must be removed from step 1 (see Sections 7/11 or the netting agreement); therefore, an amendment is evidently required.

Subject: RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable
Financing


	Mary, in step 1 all of the receivables meeting the definition of Receivable are transferred from ENA to Swee'P; in step 2 Swee'P sells an undivided interest in the pool of Receivables to ASCC [CIBC's conduit vehicle]. The September report indicated that PG&E accounted for 3,340,000/167,000,000 th's of ASCC's interest in the pool of receivables [ASCC having an interest of 167,000,000 divided by some larger amount [which amount includes the excess concentration amount, a reserve requirement, etc.]] Swee'P obtained from ENA.  Note that if the PG&E receivable is ""removed"" from step 2, then all that really happens is that no credit is given to Swee'P in the numerator, resulting in a smaller undivided interest in the pool being transferred to ASCC; however, by virtue of the PG&E receivable being transferred from ENA to Swee'P in step 1, the PG&E receivable will always be in the denominator, and ASCC will always buy an undivided interest in the pool which includes the PG&E receivable, it will just buy a smaller percentage interest if it is excluded from the numerator. I need to know what you mean by ""extracting"" the receivable -- if you mean that no credit is obtained by Swee'P in the calculation of the undivided interest that ASCC purchases, then that can be accomplished on the next reinvestment date. If you mean that no undivided interest in the receivable can be transferred to ASCC, then I think it needs to come out of step 1 [so that it is removed from the denominator, not just the numerator], and I think that the only way to do that is by amending the documents.

Per Lisa Mellencamp and based upon visiting with Mark Taylor, extracting the PGE receivables on 10/25, the next regular date, is satisfactory.  Please note that the master netting does not include the PGE utility entity, only the non-utilities.  Joel, you have a copy of the netting agreement showing all parties thereto.  You should check with Hodge re any utility gas contract receivables.

    Help on the way
    Tribute fundraiser for rescue workers set for Fire Station

    THE Heights is a long way from the sites of Sept. 11's terrorist
attacks,
but thanks to a local couple, Heights residents will have the
opportunity to come together to send their help to those communities.
    A tribute and fundraiser to support New York City and Washington,
D.C.
firefighters will be held at the Heights Fire Station 2-5 p.m. Sunday.
The event is described by Houston Heights Association president Laura
Thorp as ``a community gathering and fundraiser to show our support and
honor the firefighters that gave their lives during the recent attacks
in New York City and Washington, D.C.''
    Money raised from this event will be donated equally to New York
Firefighters 9-11 Disaster Relief Fund and the American Red Cross
Disaster Relief Fund.
    The fundraiser is the brainchild of Heights residents Nanci and John

Lamar, who are both New York natives.
    ``I grew up in the city, getting half-price tickets to go up to the
top
of the World Trade Center, so this really hit home for me,'' said Nanci
Lamar. ``My parents are still in the city. They were on a train when it
happened, and someone came on the loudspeaker to tell everyone what was
going on.''
    The Lamars, whose son Ayars will turn 4 on Oct. 10, were on a
vacation
in New Orleans the weekend after the attacks when the idea hit them to
hold a fundraiser.
    ``It was my husband's idea more than mine,'' Nanci Lamar said. ``But
we
were sitting at dinner in New Orleans and thought what a great resource
we have in the neighborhood with the Fire Station and what a great place

it would be to have such an event.''
    On Sept. 17, the Lamars presented their idea to the Houston Heights
Association's board of directors meeting. The idea met with support, but

with one caveat.
    ``We saw right away that it was a great idea, so we decided to
sponsor
it, but we told them `You're the chairs.' '' said Thorp.
    ``We had no idea what that really meant, but we also knew that it
was the
least we could do,'' said Lamar. ``Yet the sentiment that we've heard
from
everyone and the help they're giving to put this event on has been so
inspiring.
    ``This is more than a fundraiser, it's the community coming together
to
show our strength.''
    Thorp agreed.
    ``John and Nanci are showing the true spirit of neighborhood here,''
she
said. ``It's a rally to bring the neighborhood together and remember
these people and give our support.''
    Since then, the Lamars have been working nonstop to put together a
first
class event. Houston Fire Chief Chris Connealy is scheduled to appear
along with fire trucks and local fire fighters. A singer from Opera in
the Heights will lead the crowd in song, and letters to the relief and
rescue workers from area schools will be on display. There will also be
paper on hand for people to add to the letter pile, and a large banner
for people to sign that will be sent to the workers along with the
donation. Refreshments will include popcorn, snow cones and soft
drinks.
    ``Kids can write letters and hang them up when they're there.
Everyone
will be able to come together in a show of community support,'' Nanci
Lamar said.
    ``We didn't even know whether or not the Fire Station would be
available,
so we were thankful that the Heights Association could make it
available. It's booked all the way to Christmas, and there'll be a
wedding that night, so we'll be downstairs, which turns out to be
perfect for us.''
    The images on the television have been horrific for the last two
weeks,
but Lamar said that one image in particular is what continues to
motivate her and her husband.
    ``When we saw those firefighters rushing up into those burning
buildings
and getting everyone to race down. That was so moving, and really got us

thinking about doing something to recognize these people,'' she said.
    Lamar is familiar with the process of healing amidst pain and
tragedy in
her professional role as a social worker, and understands how important
it is for people to come together at times of shared pain.
    ``I'm a private social worker and letting people tell their stories
is a
big part of counseling,'' she said. ``Similarly, having people come
together to express their thoughts in the aftermath of this unimaginable

event is something that hopefully can be inspiring.
    ``Just speaking for myself, seeing the response has been so
inspiring to
me. There are a lot of people that we don't even know in our
neighborhood, but this has really brought us all together with people
that we would not have connected with otherwise. Everyone is just a
person, and we're all going through this. That has been real inspiring
and a real lesson for me.
    ``This is a looking forward and a demonstration of our strength as a

community. That is as important as the fundraising aspect of it.''

    CROQUET CHALLENGE

    The Classic Croquet Challenge, a benefit fundraiser for the
Boulevard
Beautification Project, is set for 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Oct. 20 at the
Houston Polo Club.
    The event is sponsored by the Houston Heights Association, the City
of
Houston Parks and Recreation Department and the Houston Croquet
Association.
    Spectator Tickets are $50 per person and include drinks and a
gourmet
boxed lunch. There will be music by the Young Family String Band out of
Austin, Texas, and a lunchtime fashion show by Harold's in the Heights.
    If you'd like to play, teams of two players are $250 which includes
all
of the above.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

"RE: Power Demand w/ECC - EOL","There appears to have been some confusion over the pricing to be used as the reference index for these deals.  I am sorry for any confusion I have added with my comments below.  I now understand that the index referenced in Cooper's weather deals is some sort of new Alberta Power Pool load index, the language for which I have not seen until just now.  Cooper has confirmed that the index should be this new load index based upon the Pool Monthly Summary in the ""Historical"" URL.  I agree that the initial language is insufficient.  After my rant below, I will now, with my tail between my legs, have a look at the language that has been proposed below for the load index and send out any comments I have in short order.

Subject:	FW: Power Demand w/ECC - EOL

Before we get too far along in redrafting the Alberta Power Pool pricing index, I have some thoughts on the discussion below.  

The first point that should be kept in mind is that the Index language provided to you originally by Dianne Seib (which I have reproduced again below) is the language currently used in ECC's physical and financial power transactions in Alberta and has wide-spread industry acceptance.  I do not believe that rewriting it is in the best interests of ECC, even if it is just for transactions between ECC and RMT, as inconsistency, particularly what could be significant inconsistency, between the calculation of pricing could cause problems with ECC's ability to properly manage its position as well as regarding accounting and operational matters.  

Also, I am unclear as to how the original language provided to you by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get someone to the specific pricing reference.  In Alberta, we have always referenced the ""Actual/Forecast"" pricing table as opposed to the ""Historical"" pricing table and if the URL that is referenced in the original description provided to you by Dianne Seib is inserted into your internet browser it takes you directly to the ""Actual/Forecast"" table.  Then, the column and row references set forth in the original description take you to the specific price point.  Therefore, I am unclear as to how the previous description provided by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get you to the actual price point.  As far as using the ""Actual/Forecast"" table as opposed to the ""Historical"" table, I believe that both tables get you to the same point, given that, by the end of each day, the ""Actual/Forecast"" table sets forth the actual pricing for each hour of that day.  

In addition, I do not believe that it is correct to use a price averaged over the day as opposed to the actual price for each hour during the day (as is contemplated in the original description).  Perhaps it is different when using the index for weather derivatives, but, when entering into power swaps or physical power buy/sells, it is essential to use the actual price for each hour rather than an average because (a) the determination period is each hour, not each day, and (b) more importantly it is very common to have a power product that only relates to certain hours of a day (ie. non-peak hours or peak hours) or has a term of less than one day, in which case a daily average would be unacceptable.  

Finally, it is necessary to include the language ""provided that the Floating Price shall be corrected to reflect any ""Pool Price Errors"" as may be posted on such web page, or otherwise communicated, from time to time by the Power Pool of Alberta"" at the end of the description to deal with any pricing errors posted by the Power Pool.  

Just to ensure we are talking about the same language, the current language in use in Alberta for the Alberta Power Pool Index is as follows:

The actual hourly price of Electricity as published (in final, not forecast, form) by the Power Pool of Alberta in the table entitled ""Actual/Forecast"" reported for the applicable day in the column for ""Actual Posted Pool Price"" and in the row(s) for the applicable Determination/Calculation Period, on the Power Pool of Alberta internet web page currently located at www.powerpool.ab.ca/Market/Reports/ActualForecastReportServlet; provided that the Floating Price shall be corrected to reflect any ""Pool Price Errors"" as may be posted on such web page, or otherwise communicated, from time to time by the Power Pool of Alberta.

Therefore, I am very concerned with the redraft of this language.  Our preference is to retain the language as is currently in use, as we believe it is accurate and specific, works properly for physical and financial power transactions and has wide-spread acceptance in the Alberta Power market.  If there are specific nuances arising from the fact that we are dealing with a weather derivative tied to the Power Pool Index, I would prefer that they be addressed elsewhere in the confirmation rather than redrafting the standard Power Pool Index language.

Diane,

Thanks for the correction to the content and the language. There are just a couple of minor edits that I would propose to the language below - these are highlighted.

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool loads for all hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period.  The  Floating Amount shall be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the ""Average"" daily ""Pool Demand (MW)"" for each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period set forth in the ""Power Pool of Alberta Operations Report"" for each relevant month found in the ""Pool Monthly Summary"" Report of the ""Historical"" ""Reports"" section published by the Alberta Power Pool on its official web site currently located at <http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/>, , or any successor thereto. The transaction is for the average of hourly pool demands on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am).  ""Delivery Day"" means each day during the Calculation P eriod

Thanks,
Vivek

All,  

Please take a look at the attached language proposed for the Floating Rate for the EOL  Alberta Hourly deals with ECC.  The changes incorporate a more specific route to the referenced data:
The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool loads for all hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period.  The  Floating Amount shall be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the ""Average"" daily ""Pool Demand (MW)"" for each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period set forth in the ""Power Pool of Alberta Monthly Report"" for each relevant month found in the ""Pool Monthly Summary"" page of the ""Historical"" ""Reports"" section published by the Alberta Power Pool on its official web site currently located at <http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/>, , or any successor thereto. The transaction is for the average of hourly pool demands on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am).  ""Delivery Day"" means each day during the Calculation P eriod


 

Please let me know if this accurately reflects the location of the data, and if you agree to use this language.

Thanks,
Diane

Click on 'Reports'
Click on 'Historical'
Scroll the box to 'Pool Monthly Summary' , choose the month, year, and click OK

Eduardo,  

I spoke with Brent Hendry regarding these deals and we need to have some clarification on the Floating Amount language.  Conceptually it is OK, but when you go to the website http://www.powerpool.ab.ca , there is no specific heading titled ""Power Pool of Alberta Hourly Load Data"" - unless we're just missing where on the website it is located.  Either way, if we're going to be specific, we need to give the exact location of the data, not just a generalized concept - if it is buried somewhere in one of the pages, we need to give adequate info in order to get to that page.  

Please advise.

"How are you ?","Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal

Could you (or someone in your group) give Jane some guidance on Jane's questions as they relate to the launch of these derivative products on EOL? I would think we would want to use English or NY law to govern the swaps since ENA would be the counterparty. Jane, not only b/c ENA is the contemplated counterparty, I think we would want to avoid Japanese law and have a strong preference English or NY due to those latter legal systems having well developed bodies of financial contract law.

Subject:	Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap


Hi Alan (and Susan),

As you may know, Enron Japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto EOL in an effort to try and pry the Japanese market open a little bit faster.  Although this is an Enron Japan initiative, the Enron CP would be ENA, so the governing law should probably not be Japanese (but this is unclear - there is a thought that Japanese CPs may prefer Japanese law, but it is also arguable whether they would know or care - in any case Susan, any tax issues in having ENA doing yen denominated trades over EOL under Japanese law?

Anyway the main reason for the email is that I have some very boring questions.  Alan, I am not sure (and to be honest have never really been able to figure out) who makes global EOL legal decisions, whether they come out of London or Houston (because seems to be some overlap) - but since the CP would be ENA, Houston legal will have to be involved, so perhaps Mark Taylor, but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person.

1.	Procedure wise - who should draft the GTCs for this new product?
2.	If they are done under a US law - who gives legal sign off? 
3.	If they are done under Japanese law - can I sign off? Very happy to do so but not having any EOL experience I would need to work closely with someone from EOL legal who could confirm that other than any issues of Japanese law, they are consistent with what we want from the EOL GTCs generally.
4.	Who signs off on ""product descriptions"" - what is the formal process - I assume it includes the commercial person - in this case Stefan Niesler, does it also require someone from legal, do I do this as the EJ lawyer - should l also get the ENA lawyer to approve since the CP is ENA.

Sorry if these questions seem trivial but I don't know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing what.

Thanks very much.

Kind regards.

Sorry I missed your call yesterday.  The answer to the question you left on your phone message (i.e., whether there are any tax issues given the current description and facts relating to the WTI product) is no, there shouldn't be any tax issues under the structure described below.

Are you going to revise the description for the product that is currently on EnronOnline Datamanager?  (It currently has the old description where Enron Japan Corp. was going to enter into these transactions.)

Subject:	yen nominated WTI swap

Susan,

I hope I didn't confuse you too much yesterday night. 
Here is a quick run down on how we think the Japanese Yen nominated WTI Swap could work:

The mechanics remain the same. The US WTI Swap quotes are converted in Yen/KL and posted on EOL. Incoming transaction are hedged out against the US WTI Swap and the FX exposure is hedge out manually. 

The Enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ENA. (same as for the US WTI Swap). The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA. (That's nothing new, they already do that.) 

Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development. First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution. ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books. (No EJ books as touched in this transactions). 
The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate. We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market. It is supporting our overall market penetration effort. 
The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group. Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don't see as material. The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with non-Japanese counterparties. In addition, the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJ's from a Japanese point of view. 

I hope this helps to clarify some things. Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information.

Thank you!

Regards,
StN

"North American Energy and Developing Proucts Committee Conference	 Call","ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.
600 Fifth Avenue
Rockefeller Center - 27th floor
New York, NY 10020
Phone: (212) 332-1200
Fax: (212) 332-1212
EMail: isda@isda.org
Website: www.isda.org


During the North American Energy and Developing Products Committee meeting
on November 2, the group discussed NYMEX's intention to close on Friday,
November 23.  This date appears to be an unscheduled holiday.  The issue we
pose to the Committee is the following:

1.  Should ISDA issue a market practice statement on the November 23 closing
of NYMEX?

2.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, what treatment should result for
November 23?

3.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, how should options that expire on
November 23 be treated?  (This may be less of an issue for European style
options).

4.  What types of Market Disruption Events are typically included in your
contracts?

I would direct your attention to Section 1.4 of the 1993 ISDA Commodity
Derivatives Definitions (definition of Commodity Business Day) and ISDA's
Market Practice Statement on Equity Derivatives (available on our website),
where September 11, 12, 13 and 14 were not considered trading days for
equity derivatives purposes.

I would be grateful if you could respond to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org)
on each of the four questions above. Also, I propose to have a conference
call on Friday, November 9 at 10:30 a.m. New York Time.  The call-in details
are set forth below:

Non-US Callers:		865 523 8154
US Callers:		800 281 4634

Participant Code:	503 399

Please respond to the four questions and your availability for the call on
Friday.  If the group decides to go forward with a market practice
statement,  I would propose finalizing a market practice statement next
week.

Thank you in advance.

Kimberly Summe
General Counsel

Good Morning Everyone,

In order to make access easier in connection with the our financial trading forms, Mary Cook has asked that the SWAP FORMS directory be divided into two (2) subdirectories as follows:

		(a) 	Current
					
		(b)	Old 

Therefore, if any of you wishes to access (a) the current forms used, or (b) the old forms now retired from use, just access as follows:

	Current Forms:	O:\Legal\ATTY.FMS\SWAP FORMS\Current

"Man Financial:  margin calculation","ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

In addition, we have received an executed Amendment Agreement dated as of November 8, 2001 between The Chase Manhattan Bank and Enron North America Corp.  The amendment replaces the definitions of ""Settlement Amount"" and ""Loss"" as set forth in the master agreement.

"RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language","Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

"Staff Meeting 10/4","Mark -

Just a few quick notes from yesterday's staff meeting (items you should know about):

Enron Direct -	Appears to be really ramping up.
		Currently using TaletTree and Saliens (sp?) (temp/consulting agencies) for sales personnel to lower end of mkt.
		Goal by 10/15 to have all commodity/tariff curves in EES database
		Looking to also load customer profile information for approx. 22K customers
		In sync with Canadian efforts and looking at Toronto as a bigger mkt than Calgary

Beth pointed out Corp. contractual commitment to Ernst & Young of $60MM annually and suggestion to consider them for consulting services.  Currently Corp. spend is approx. $40MM annually.

Pipeling software products - 	Have contract with Luminent for marketing
				Enron gets 100% of license fees and continues to own products (including all enhancements)
				Luminent gets opportunity to do all integration
				Product price is $500,000

Jay indicated Kiodex transaction data fee is up and ready for operation.  Waiting for Kiodex to be ready to go live.  The Kiodex product will appear as a ""Risk Report"" button inside of EOL.

Mention was made of the ""layoffs"" in Europe, but Greg indicated it may not be much of an impact on ENW personnel presuming the level of support for existing businesses remains constant.

Nothing else in particular was discussed.

Tom and I did have an opportunity to speak about some CommodityLogic items subsequent to the staff meeting.  His big concern remains the speed with which we are able to produce amendment documents for counterparties, especially in light of the fact that Greg now wants weekly reports on the progress of these amendments - from Tom.  I worked with Brent, Bob and Kathryn Cordes yesterday on a possible short term solution that may at least enable the CommodityLogic marketing personnel to put a base amendment form (not to be signed) in front of counterparties.  The base amendment form would clearly indicate that additional information was necessary before an agreement was reached.  This would be followed up by the actual ""guts"" of the legal confirm language.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.

Mark

"(01-398) CORRECTION: REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS	 FUTURES","December 4, 2001
Notice No. 01-398

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	CORRECTION: REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS
FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to that notice, this notice includes the text of this EFS rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

"ENRON ONLINE RE: ENHANCED LIMIT ORDER OPTION","Fred, sorry for not getting back to you sooner, but I understand you were in communication with Mark Taylor.  Thanks for the quick turn around and excellent and thorough analysis.  I have both read and understand the analysis.  I am somewhat concerned regarding the final comment regarding ASC's scrutiny of EOL, but other than being careful, I am not sure what we can do.

With respect to transactions with counterparties who are not ""Qualified Parties"", it is almost inconceivable given the breadth of the ""commercial user"" exemption and the representations obtained in our contract that we would ever transact with a counterparty which is not a Qualified Party.

A US Power Spread Transaction (as defined below) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. under which the Seller (the ""Spread Seller"") and the Buyer (the ""Spread Buyer"") shall enter into two physical power transactions, under which either (A) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to buy from Enron, Counterparty shall buy the First Product and sell the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price in accordance with the terms of the ""Firm (LD)"" definition in Schedule P of the Edison Electric Institute Master Power Purchase and Sale Agreement Version 2.1 (modified 4/25/00), including, without limitation, any defined terms contained therein, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the master agreement, if any, that governs these Transactions (""Firm (LD) Energy""); or (B) for the case in which Counterparty submits an offer to sell to Enron, Counterparty shall sell the First Product and buy the Second Product, each in respect of the quantity of Firm (LD) energy equal to the Hourly Quantity at the Contract Price.
The transaction is for the applicable hours as set forth herein on each Delivery Day for the Effective Date 01 Oct 2001 to the Termination Date 31 Oct 2001.
The Contract Price for the Second Transaction in this short description will be the midpoint of the bid and offer price(s) on the Website for the second product listed in the short description at the time of the Transaction if both the bid and offer prices are then available or the available price if only one of such prices is then available. The Contract Price for the First Transaction will be the Contract Price used for the Second Transaction, modified by the price submitted by the Counterparty on the Website.
The Spread Transaction shall mean the ERCOT Transaction together with the ERCOT N 2001Transaction.  The Spread Seller and the Spread Buyer agree that the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction shall be treated as separate transactions under any applicable agreement(s) governing such transactions.  Accordingly, for example, if a party fails to perform under the ERCOT Transaction, the other party is not excused from performance under the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction based on such non-performance.  However, unless otherwise expressly defined, the term ""transaction"" as used on the Website shall mean each of the ERCOT Transaction and the ERCOT N 2001 Transaction.  The ERCOT Transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") at Seller's daily election. If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.  The ERCOT N 2001 transaction is for delivery or receipt of energy to any points within the North 2001 Zone as finalized pursuant to the action on April 17, 2001 by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") Board of Directors, at Seller's daily election. If such North 2001 Zone is superceded by a zone or zones of different boundaries, Seller shall nevertheless be required, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, to deliver the energy to points within the geographical area coextensive with the originally defined North 2001 Zone.  If and when possible for Seller to designate under pertinent ERCOT scheduling practices, any such points shall be connected to the ERCOT Transmission Grid by Transmission Facilities (as such terms are defined in the ERCOT Protocols) operated at or above 138kV.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be megawatt-hours (MWh) and the quantity shown shall be in MW's delivered in each applicable hour for the duration of the Transaction (the ""Hourly Quantity').

"Intercontinental Exchange","To All -

Attached is an updated version of the Intercontinental Exchange Participant Agreement - complete with schedules for transaction costs in various commodities.  This form is a new version of the existing Participant Agreement Enron currently has in place and is anticipated to be effective on December 1, 2001.  While I have been reviewing the legal terms and conditions, I need some assistance from you - the business personnel - on the pricing stated in the applicable schedules.  These price schedules have all been updated from the existing contracts.

At your convenience, please review the schedule applicable to your particular commodity or forward it to the appropriate person for review.  Please let me know if the pricing is acceptable.  Granted, since this is a form agreement we may not have much power to change any pricing, but I at least want each of you to be aware of the changes.

Thanks.


Mark


For Attorneys - I welcome any comments you may have on the agreement.  I will also be circulating a draft with my comments.

The attached is a list that Janna Blanter at Duke sent which details the transactions that they believe are between Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership and ENA which need to be moved to the ECC ISDA. From our records, I do not think this matches, but we need to reconcile.  Kim, if you could try to match these up and pull the confirms to determine which legal entity we used. Anything that is ENA we will need to assign to ECC. Please advise.

John Arnold asked me this morning about individuals on EOL.  Apparently,. John was told that I had a problem with this.  I haven't had a conversation on this since 1999,. At that time I sidelined the issue as it was complex, bearing in mind everything else that was going on.  I would suggest you and Mark address tis together.
I have no idea who told John this as I haven't had a dizcussion on this issue since 1999.

"Alberta Power Pool Load Index","I have now had a chance to review the initial language describing the load index that was being discussed in the flurry of e-mails this morning.  My preference would be to keep the language as consistent as possible with the language for the pricing index.  Given that the actual hourly load is also posted in the ""Actual/Forecast"" table from which we derive the pricing index (under the column ""Actual AIS Demand""), I would propose that we simply reference that same table and the appropriate column and use the arithmetic average of the actual load for all hours.  In doing so, the products will be consistent.  I also am not sure that we would then need to have a definition of ""Load"", as the formula for calculating the ""Floating Amount"" is made certain without the requirement to define ""load"".  My proposed wording is as follows:

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool load for all hours beginning with HE 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with HE 2400 (12:00 am) in each Delivery Day as published (in final, not forecast, form) by the Power Pool of Alberta in the table entitled ""Actual/Forecast"" reported for the applicable Delivery Day in the column for ""Actual AIS Demand"" and in the row(s) for the applicable hours, on the Power Pool of Alberta internet web page currently located at www.powerpool.ab.ca/Market/Reports/ActualForecastReportServlet.  ""Delivery Day"" means a day during the term of the transaction.

I assume that it is most appropriate to use an average of the daily loads as opposed to, say, the actual load for each hour or a monthly average.  

Let me know what your thoughts are regarding this language.

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

"RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable Financing","Not being aware of all the ins and outs of your transaction, but based upon the description below and the provisions of the master netting agreement, I think the receivables must be removed from step 1 (see Sections 7/11 or the netting agreement); therefore, an amendment is evidently required.

Subject: RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable
Financing


	Mary, in step 1 all of the receivables meeting the definition of Receivable are transferred from ENA to Swee'P; in step 2 Swee'P sells an undivided interest in the pool of Receivables to ASCC [CIBC's conduit vehicle]. The September report indicated that PG&E accounted for 3,340,000/167,000,000 th's of ASCC's interest in the pool of receivables [ASCC having an interest of 167,000,000 divided by some larger amount [which amount includes the excess concentration amount, a reserve requirement, etc.]] Swee'P obtained from ENA.  Note that if the PG&E receivable is ""removed"" from step 2, then all that really happens is that no credit is given to Swee'P in the numerator, resulting in a smaller undivided interest in the pool being transferred to ASCC; however, by virtue of the PG&E receivable being transferred from ENA to Swee'P in step 1, the PG&E receivable will always be in the denominator, and ASCC will always buy an undivided interest in the pool which includes the PG&E receivable, it will just buy a smaller percentage interest if it is excluded from the numerator. I need to know what you mean by ""extracting"" the receivable -- if you mean that no credit is obtained by Swee'P in the calculation of the undivided interest that ASCC purchases, then that can be accomplished on the next reinvestment date. If you mean that no undivided interest in the receivable can be transferred to ASCC, then I think it needs to come out of step 1 [so that it is removed from the denominator, not just the numerator], and I think that the only way to do that is by amending the documents.

Per Lisa Mellencamp and based upon visiting with Mark Taylor, extracting the PGE receivables on 10/25, the next regular date, is satisfactory.  Please note that the master netting does not include the PGE utility entity, only the non-utilities.  Joel, you have a copy of the netting agreement showing all parties thereto.  You should check with Hodge re any utility gas contract receivables.

"Curricular Review Task Force Report #10 & Draft Educational Goals","Curriculum Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report # 10 (November 5, 2001)


October was a very busy and productive month for the Curriculum Review Task
Force. We had intensive three-hour meetings on October 3 and 9 which were
followed by routine meetings on October 22 and 29. On the 18th, three CRTF
members (George Arnold, Craig Watson, and Raj Ambrose) participated in a
meeting of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Trustees which was devoted
entirely to the Curriculum Review.

As explained in my last report, the CRTF obtained unanimous agreement on the
five Educational Goals: A. Critical Thinking, B. Communication, C. Values,
Inquiry, and Exploration, D. Variety of Human Experience, and E. Depth of
Knowledge and Integration of Learning with an addendum on Wellness/Health
Co-curriculum. The Task Force then used an intensive work session to brain
storm on the operational ends of these goals. Further discussion and some
pruning led to 4 or 5 operational ends for each goal. Two members of the
Task Force wrote the descriptive statements for each goal and its
operational ends. These were then reviewed by the full Task Force and with
another member contributing the preamble, the draft statement on Educational
Goals (copy attached) was ready for presentation to the faculty. At the
request of the CRTF, the Faculty Senate reviewed these educational goals and
decided to send them for a ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion at the
ensuing faculty meeting. We would like to point out that the CRTF looked at
several models from other schools in preparing the Educational Goals. Some
of these schools are very similar to Monmouth College.

The ten trustees who were present at the Academic Affairs Committee meeting
had a preview of the draft educational goals. The trustees received them
very well and made some valuable suggestions.

The CRTF has spent considerable time discussing how these goals can be
achieved through a well-planned, four-year, integrated curriculum. The
work-load, calendar, departmental structure, general education models, and
available resources are some of the major issues that are being considered
in relation to the achievement of these educational goals.

Dr. Tom Sienkewicz brought to our attention that Dr. Gregory Dougherty, who
gave the recent Bernice L. Fox Classics Lecture, is a member of the
Curriculum Review Task Force at Randolph Macon College which is also in the
midst of a major Curricular Review. As part of this process, they had
studied the Educational Programs of about half a dozen colleges which are
similar to Randolph Macon and our college happened to be one of them. We
invited Dr. Dougherty to the meeting of our Task Force on October 29 and had
a very fruitful discussion with him. Of particular interest to us is
Randolph Macon=s new first year program which uses a three-course sequence
of ALearning Communities@ developed and taught by all their faculty taking
turns. We decided to keep in touch.

Raj Ambrose, Chair.


 Draft Educational Goals

The AEducational Goals@ listed and briefly described below represent
consensus of the Curriculum Review Task Force about intended outcomes and
experiences of the academic program that should guide review and revision of
the Monmouth College curriculum, especially with reference to Areinvesting
in pedagogy@ and re-imagining design to enhance student learning.

We are confident that this list summarizes educational goals central to the
liberal arts philosophy of higher education.  We also understand that these
educational goals affirm and clarify  elements of the Mission Statement of
the college and those Apurposes@ derived from the Mission that directly
address the academic program.

Having spent considerable time articulating these goals, we are keenly aware
that agreement about the language we use to describe them is both important
for subsequent stages in the review process and achievable only through
discussion and mutual compromise.

Our aim then in the ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion upcoming at the
November 4th Faculty meeting is to present this statement for your review,
explain what we mean by the language we have used, listen to your responses,
and, if necessary, make changes.

What will we do if and when we win your agreement to this or a revised
version of AEducational Goals@?

		1. We will decide questions we have already begun to
discuss: AGiven these goals, how best may we enable students to achieve them
in four years of undergraduate education?  Specifically, does our present
array and structure of disciplines optimally promote achievement?  Our
calendar?  Our workload?  Our general education program?   Our pedagogical
approaches in classroom settings?  Our extra-curricular, curricular
programming (residence education, internships, off-campus opportunities,
etc.) ?

		2. In light of this critique (which in the coming months
will itself sponsor more frequent  discussions of possible proposals for
change in calendar, workload, General Education, etc.), we will attempt to
map and model then four years of undergraduate education ideally designed to
achieve our educational goals.   In this phase of the process especially, we
will involve faculty as researchers, resources, and planners to a)
understand our student clientele and their typical cognitive development; b)
revise our current curriculum; and c) enhance pedagogy and clarify
assessment strategies pertinent to our educational goals.

With approval of AEducational Goals@ we imagine spending the next five to
seven months on stages 1 and 2, with the understanding that it may be
possible to pass new initiatives and proposals for revision incrementally
along the way.    Furthermore, given the scope of our Areview,@ it may well
be necessary to imagine a multi-year schedule of planning and phased
implementation that extends well beyond the term of the current task force=s
assignment.

It should be noted that competencies like critical thinking and rhetoric,
though presented conceptually as separate entities under different goals,
will actually be interwoven throughout the curriculum and work interactively
with other competencies and goals.

A. Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is an acquired intellectual process through which
students are able to analyze carefully and critically all ideas and
information by distinguishing fact from fallacy, questioning assumptions,
synthesizing knowledge, and arriving at logical conclusions. This competency
is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	understand the logic, validity and relevance of their own arguments
and the information and ideas they observe and work with;
2.	pose and solve complex problems and make informed decisions;
3.	understand and apply the scientific method where the concerned
discipline requires such an approach; and,
4.	work with numerical data and apply quantitative reasoning in
processing such data.

B. Communication
Communication is a foundational competency which the students absolutely
need and continue to learn across the curriculum with a conscious effort to
improve their reading, writing, speaking, listening and information literacy
skills. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	use effectively and grammatically a broad English vocabulary in
speaking and writing through accomplished rhetorical strategies;
2.	access, evaluate, select, interpret, and incorporate information and
media sources in their studies and to be productive in the modern
technological world;
3.	have a basic understanding of another language (besides English) and
its cultural background; and,
4.	interact with others with empathy and understanding and collaborate
effectively in group settings.

C. Values, Inquiry, and Exploration
It is the ability of students to explore the nature and scope of the human
condition through specific modes of inquiry and to develop a system of
values that would help them make real choices and assume responsibility for
their actions. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students
to:
1.	address thoughtfully the basic question, Awho am I?@ and develop a
clear Aknowledge of the self@ and understand how it motivates all their
actions;
2.	understand and explore the concept that religion is basically a
system of beliefs and activities that responds to the transforming power of
the sacred or ultimate as perceived by a particular community of people.
3.	develop a Acode of conduct@ or Arules for living@ based on the
highest ethical ideals so that they can think and act through principled
moral reasoning;
4.	learn the values of social responsibility and the importance of
being an honest and true citizen; and,
5.	observe, appreciate and experience the beauty and art in the
creation of this moral universe.

D. Variety of Human Experience
Students today are constantly reminded that they indeed live in a global
society. It is critical that they understand that there are many ways of
being human and that the world is rich with a variety of cultural
perspectives. In order to prepare students for their future careers and
personal lives in this environment, students should be able to:
1.	develop global awareness;
2.	have a basic understanding of another language (besides English) and
its cultural background;
3.	understand that there is a variety of cultural perspectives that
exists in this world and develop the analytical skill to interpret these
perspectives; and,
4.	establish a historical sense and perspective that help them
comprehend past events and frame in a broader perspective different
worldwide events that influence their daily lives.

E. Depth of Knowledge and Integration of Learning
An important component of liberal education is to study in depth a
discipline or group of disciplines and see the connections within the
discipline and with other areas of study, thereby leading to a collaborative
and integrated learning experience. The students thus develop:
1.	an intellectual depth to grasp major concepts, understand the limits
of a discipline and its linkages, and the ability to use such knowledge in
their field of work;
2.	an appreciation and understanding of interdisciplinary studies;
3.	laboratory expertise and field experience in their chosen fields;
and,
4.	the competence to pursue scholarly research as a culminating
experience in their field of study.

Addendum:

Wellness/Health Co-curriculum
It is important that we offer learning environments for our students that
reflect recent research findings that explore the connections between our
physical and mental capacities. Therefore we should provide our students
with learning opportunities that integrate the philosophies of sound mind
and sound body.  Students would learn about and participate in activities
that will improve their health and overall quality of life. This goal is
demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	participate in physical fitness activities;
2.	develop an ability to establish wellness of mind; and,
3.	understand the importance of a healthy environment for healthy
living.


Note: After considerable discussion, it was decided, at least for now, to
keep AHaving a basic understanding of another language ...@ under both B3,
ACommunication@ and D2, AVariety of Human Experience@.

Attached is a first draft of the proposed settlement agreement for the CreditStream product.  I have provided standard provisions in relation to liabilities, waiver and releases.  Where there are blanks, I am waiting for additional information and hope to have that soon.  As to Paragraph 7, I was unable to locate a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement between RMG and EnronCredit.com from Sept., 2000.  Once located, I will probably incorporate the confidentiality terminology into the release/settlement.  I hope to have a copy of this agreement a bit later today.

Please look over the attached and provide any comments or questions you may have.

"RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name","Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

"I'm in London","Thank you for your e-mail and phone call!  We received both and were
really sorry not to be here when you called.  I guess we were both at
work.  When we were watching this tragedy on TV Tuesday, we couldn't
remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly
called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a
relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned
on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you
could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.

Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing
anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was
OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was
opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both
were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would
take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home
during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.
 It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek
Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the
river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were
emptying into hers.

Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his
flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas.
Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in
Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!

Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't
know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing
errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house
for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you
and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched
me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I
called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and
that you were in London.

At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.
 You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went
into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that
the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more
populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found
it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but
finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do
something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside
on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary
election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was
something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we
checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a
prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.

Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as
possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The
terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.

I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you
have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better
than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.
 I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish
something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston
these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the
Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for
communication difficulties and even ""bunkers"" or alternate offices in
place that they are now using.

This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope
they are up to it.

Please let us know when you finally get home.

Love, Mother

"(01-411) NEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUT	URES","November 30, 2001
Notice No. 01-411

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NEW NYMEX LARGE ORDER EXECUTION RULE FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Yesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-411, which
summarized a new large order execution (LOX) that begins today in the first
two months of the natural gas futures contract.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				NEW NYMEX RULE 6.58

Rule 6.58.	LARGE LOT TRADING OF FUTURES CONTRACTS (PILOT PROGAM)

A Floor Member may buy or sell a large lot quantity of futures contracts at
or above the minimum amount specified below at a single price on an all or
none basis, provided that each such transaction is conducted on the Exchange
trading floor in accordance with the large order execution (""LOX"")
procedures specified in this rule.

(A) Eligible Futures Contract and Minimum LOX Transaction Size.  LOX
transactions may be effected only for transactions in the following NYMEX
Division futures contracts and for no less than the following minimum LOX
transaction quantities:

			Futures Contract 		Contract Months
Minimum LOX Transaction Size

			Natural Gas			1st and 2nd nearby
250
	(Six-Month Pilot Program)

(B) Eligible Orders.  A member may not execute any order by means of a LOX
transaction unless the LOX bid or Offer price is the best price available to
satisfy the terms of the order or unless the order includes specific
instructions to execute a LOX transaction.

(C) Request for Quote.  To make a request for quote (RFQ) for a LOX
transaction, an initiating Floor Member (Initiating Member) will announce an
interest in executing a LOX transaction either by requesting a LOX Bid or
Offer or both, from a specified location in the ring.  In addition, the
Initiating Member must specify to the ring the total quantity and contract
month of the RFQ.  All terms of the RFQ including the identity of the
Initiating Member will be recorded by the LOX Book Holder (LBH).  In any
case that a LOX RFQ results in a response deemed by the LBH to be
reasonable, the Initiating Member will incur RFQ fees, regardless of whether
or not that Floor Member executes a trade.

There shall be only one active RFQ for a contract month at a time.

The maximum quantity allowed for a LOX RFQ is 5,000 contracts.

(D) Bids and Offers in Response to a LOX RFQ. Any Floor Member that has bid
and/or offered the best price in response to the LOX RFQ for the full
quantity stated in the LOX RFQ and has been recognized by the LBH as making
a reasonable bid or offer will be the Initial Respondent.  Any Floor Member
responding to a LOX RFQ must indicate that the responding LOX bid or LOX
offer is in response to such RFQ (LOX Bid or Offer).  Once a LOX Bid and/or
Offer has been made and deemed by the LBH to be an acceptable bid and/or
offer, such bid or offer will be recorded by the LBH and will be active for
30 seconds from the time it has been recognized by the LBH or until it has
been expressly withdrawn, with acknowledgement from the LBH, by the Floor
Member making such bid or offer.  All LOX bids and offers must be quoted in
half cent or full cent increments.

(1) LOX Bids and Offers Outside Non-LOX Spread. A LOX Bid (Offer) may be at
or above (below) the instant bid (offer) for non-LOX trading being bid or
offered in the ring for that futures contract month.

(2) Aggregation of Orders by Brokers. Floor Members acting as brokers may
bundle limit orders to bid and/or offer in response to the LOX RFQ.  If the
total of the orders is less than the requested amount, the responding broker
can trade for his own account or an account which he controls, the
difference between the requested amount and the total of the orders.  In the
event that a broker bundles limit orders in connection with a LOX execution,
all bundled limited orders must receive the LOX execution price.

(3) Aggregation by Floor Members Trading for Proprietary Accounts.  In
response to a LOX RFQ, Floor Members trading for their proprietary accounts
may join together in bidding and/or offering for the full quantity of the
LOX RFQ.  Such proprietary accounts either may be a personal account in the
case of an individual member or a house proprietary account in the case of a
Member Firm or Clearing Member with a representative on the Trading Floor.

(4) Secondary Trading Right for Proprietary Accounts.  In response to a LOX
RFQ, only a Floor Member trading for his proprietary account, or for
proprietary accounts joined together as per section (D)(3) of this rule, may
bid and/or offer for a portion of the LOX RFQ, provided, however, that such
quantity bid and/or offered must be for an amount no less than the Minimum
LOX Transaction Size and that such bid and/or offer can only be submitted if
an Initial Respondent has been identified by the LBH and that Initial
Respondent is a Floor Member acting as a broker.  This right will be known
as a Secondary Trading Right.

In order to exercise the Secondary Trading Right, each Member must state
his/her intentions to the LBH.  For purposes of the Secondary Trading Right,
Floor Members trading for their proprietary trading accounts may exercise
this right by joining a bid or offer at any time prior to execution of the
LOX transaction and will be entitled to an aggregate amount of up to 50% of
the quantity stated in the RFQ.

When a Floor Member combines customer orders with proprietary business and
is recognized as the Initial Respondent, any reduction in the ultimate
allocation that results from an exercise of a Secondary Trading Right will
result in fills first allocated to the customer(s) with any remainder to the
Floor Member.  In addition, if, as the result of such an exercise, a broker
does not have a quantity sufficient to fill each of the orders that were
aggregated, the broker shall allocate fills according to the following
requirements:

a)	the fills shall be allocated pursuant to a predetermined allocation
methodology made available to the customers prior to the execution;
b)	the allocation shall be made as soon as practicable after the
transaction is executed;
c)	the allocation shall be fair and equitable and no account or group
of accounts may receive consistently favorable or unfavorable treatment;
d)	the allocation methodology shall be sufficiently objective and
specific so that it can verified for any given trade; and
e)	the allocation methodology must be consistently applied.

Floor Members may not exercise a Secondary Trading Right if such Floor
Member is the Initial Respondent acting as a broker.


(5) Trading Priority.  Any Floor Member who becomes the Initial Respondent
willing to trade the full quantity stated in the LOX RFQ at the ultimate
best bid and, or best offer will have a right of trading priority which will
entitle him to the full quantity stated in the RFQ, except in the case when
a Secondary Trading Right is exercised.


(E) LOX Execution.
1.  Time Limit Restriction. Once an Initial Respondent has been recognized
by the LBH, only the Initiating Member requesting the LOX RFQ, may hit such
LOX Bid or Offer (or both) and must do so within 30 seconds of LBH
recognition of the Initial Respondent subject to the following conditions:

2.	Exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.   If one or more Floor Members
exercises the Secondary Trading Rights provided by this rule, the LBH will
enforce such rights in the following manner:

Each Floor Member responding to the LOX RFQ (either as an Initial Respondent
or in exercise of a Secondary Trading Right) shall receive an allocation
equal to a weighted proportion based on the number of contracts bid or
offered by such Member as a percentage of the total quantity of all
contracts bid or offered in response to the LOX RFQ, as the case may be, at
the price accepted by the Initiating Member, provided,  however,

If, as a result of the allocation specified above, an Initial Respondent
acting as a broker would receive less than 50% of the total quantity, then
the LBH instead shall allocate no less than 50% of the total quantity to
such Initial Respondent with the remainder allocated to those exercising
their Secondary Trading Rights based on  the number of contracts bid or
offered by each such Floor Member as a percentage of all contracts bid or
offered pursuant to the exercise of Secondary Trading Rights.

Following execution of the LOX transaction, the LBH will confirm the parties
to the transaction and the quantity allocated to each respondent.

(F) Responsibility for LOX Orders.  A Floor Member shall not be liable for
failure to execute an order as a LOX order unless such order was designated
by the customer as a LOX order.

(G) Impact on Non-LOX Orders.  In no event shall a LOX order elect stop
loss, market-if-touched or other contingency orders, or otherwise affect
orders in the regular non-LOX market.

(H) Closing Period and Post-Close Prohibition.  LOX transactions will
neither be allowed during the closing period nor during the post-close
session for applicable contracts.

"Contract Amendments for ConfirmLogic","Hi,

I need your help. I would like you guys to prioritize the ""first 10"" and the ""second 10"" firms that we would like to change our existing trading agreements with to allow all of us to use ConfirmLogic.  I would like this process to go forward even if the counterparty has not yet signed up for the module. To my mind, the legal change simply gives us both the option (and perhaps the preference, but not the obligation) to use the module to serve as a legal confirmation.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help speed up the process. As I understand it, only Sempra currently has proposed changes in front of them. I would like us to have proposed changes in front of the top 20 clients by September 20.

Many thanks,

Tom

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by
first determining the ""Scan Risk"" and then multiplying the number of spreads
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.  Spreading between
differently margined contracts results in a higher spread margin than
between equally margined contracts.  Below is provided an example where the
legs of a spread are margined differently.
Scan Risk Example at Clearing Member Rates
A spread consisting of one futures leg in Tier 1 and another in Tier 2 will
have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at $1,000
starting on Monday, December 03, 2001.

One Long Tier 1 NG or NN	(1 * $4,500)			=
$4,500
One Short Tier 2 NG or NN	(1 * $4,000)			=	-

Gas spread credits.

McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice

"Next Brazilian Subcommittee meeting","Mark;

I saw your note replying to my earlier e-mail today re. ISDA (thanks).  Although it is Enron Brazil's goal to be able to enter into these type of energy commodities derivatives transactions in the future, it seems to me that there are several tax implications (still to be resolved and/or optimized) which prevent us from participating in this market.

Considering your and Brent's energy commodity derivatives experience in the US, do you think you could assist me to put together this ""Wish List"" for ISDA to discuss with the Brazilian authorities ?

Tks,

Sami

MEMO TO:		Latin American Committee

FROM:			Pedro D. Martinez

DATE:			September 28, 2001

RE:			Next Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting


Dear All,

ISDA would like to schedule a Brazilian Subcommittee Meeting next week. The
proposed dates are the following: October, 3rd, 4th or 5th at 11:00 am New
York time at ISDA. Please choose the date that is more convenient so that we
can make appropriate arrangements. As usual, we will provide a call in
number for people that are traveling or located abroad.

ISDA is considering a visit to Brazil of several days in order to hold
meetings with the Central Bank as well as other regulators - NMC, e.g.,
market players, netting legislation contacts, lawyers working on master
agreement development, and others in order to further the agenda of the
Brazilian Subcommittee and to be able to prepare for the conference planned
for Brazil next year.

In preparation for our subcommittee meeting ISDA would like to obtain from
your institution a list (""Wish List"") of local OTC derivatives market issues
for ISDA to address as well as suggestions for meetings and organizations
with which ISDA might meet to address these issues. This ""Wish List"" will be
of enormous help to ISDA for purposes of having an adequate and focused
agenda for planning visits with a number of Brazilian institutions and
authorities.

Please reply R.S.V.P. by email to Scott Marra (smarra@isda.org) if you would
like to attend.

If you have additional suggestions in terms of the topics to be included in
our agenda please do not hesitate to contact me.

"(01-365) EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER C	LEARING","Notice No. 01-365
October 30, 2001


TO:
All Exchange Members / Member Firms
All Clearing Members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING




EXCHANGE ANNOUNCES PLANS TO INTRODUCE OVER-THE-COUNTER CLEARING

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., last night
approved a series of measures to offer credit intermediation through
clearing services and trading tools for the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will include the introduction of exchange of futures for swap
(EFS) transactions and large order execution to the natural gas futures
market within the next few weeks, along with the previously announced
electronic trading of cleared natural gas swaps and basis contracts.

Recent events in the natural gas market have served to reinforce the
necessity of counterparty credit risk management and have accelerated the
Exchange's plans to introduce a full array of risk management tools under
the umbrella of our clearinghouse.  Combining these trading vehicles with
our Henry Hub futures contract will offer market participants the advantages
of these instruments in conjunction with one of the most liquid commodity
markets in the world and provide greater stability to the market as a whole.

The Exchange is in a unique leadership position to offer these services with
natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reaching the equivalent of
approximately 230 trillion cubic feet and the notional value of last year's
transactions Exchange-wide totaling $3 trillion, or $14 billion per day.
One half billion dollars is available to participants on each of the
Exchange divisions through each guarantee fund and the respective clearing
members.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.

The clearing member representing each party will be responsible to notify
the Exchange of the amount and type of futures contracts involved, the price
at which the futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the
parties involved.

The Exchange will also begin permitting traders to execute block trades of
250 natural gas futures contracts or more in the first two nearby months at
the best bid or offer for that size.  These trades will not be permitted
during the closing range.

Early next year, the Exchange will introduce a cleared Henry Hub natural gas
swaps contract, providing the marketplace with direct clearing on the most
popular energy swaps contract over the last several year.  As part of this
move, the Exchange will clear OTC-executed transactions through its EFS
mechanism.

Bill,

As much as I'd like to get a ""global agreement"" with several of our large
counterparties it cannot be done.  Legal has advised there are concerns
about these being enforceable.  It was a good idea , but it is not workable.
We must continue margining each other the way we are doing now.

I would appreciate it if you could get back to me as soon as possible on the issue of Enron's continued use of the HPL name on the EOL documents.

This has been a challenge for us in other deals - in a recent transaction
that Mary and I worked on, we had to limit the types of legal services to

if we can come up with a workable solution, so I'll get back to you on

Subject:	EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap 

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

*********************

Please leave me a message or send me an email if you want me to call you Monday evening your time.

"RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name","Kathryn:

The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help

Subject:	Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap


Hi Alan (and Susan),

As you may know, Enron Japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto EOL in an effort to try and pry the Japanese market open a little bit faster.  Although this is an Enron Japan initiative, the Enron CP would be ENA, so the governing law should probably not be Japanese (but this is unclear - there is a thought that Japanese CPs may prefer Japanese law, but it is also arguable whether they would know or care - in any case Susan, any tax issues in having ENA doing yen denominated trades over EOL under Japanese law?

Anyway the main reason for the email is that I have some very boring questions.  Alan, I am not sure (and to be honest have never really been able to figure out) who makes global EOL legal decisions, whether they come out of London or Houston (because seems to be some overlap) - but since the CP would be ENA, Houston legal will have to be involved, so perhaps Mark Taylor, but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person.

1.	Procedure wise - who should draft the GTCs for this new product?
2.	If they are done under a US law - who gives legal sign off? 
3.	If they are done under Japanese law - can I sign off? Very happy to do so but not having any EOL experience I would need to work closely with someone from EOL legal who could confirm that other than any issues of Japanese law, they are consistent with what we want from the EOL GTCs generally.
4.	Who signs off on ""product descriptions"" - what is the formal process - I assume it includes the commercial person - in this case Stefan Niesler, does it also require someone from legal, do I do this as the EJ lawyer - should l also get the ENA lawyer to approve since the CP is ENA.

Sorry if these questions seem trivial but I don't know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing what.

Thanks very much.

Kind regards.

Stefan,

Sorry I missed your call yesterday.  The answer to the question you left on your phone message (i.e., whether there are any tax issues given the current description and facts relating to the WTI product) is no, there shouldn't be any tax issues under the structure described below.

Are you going to revise the description for the product that is currently on EnronOnline Datamanager?  (It currently has the old description where Enron Japan Corp. was going to enter into these transactions.)

Best regards,

Apart from the FX, there will be no involvement of EJ at all. It will all be covered under ENA Corp. as the USD WTI Swap is.

Subject:	yen nominated WTI swap

Susan,

I hope I didn't confuse you too much yesterday night. 
Here is a quick run down on how we think the Japanese Yen nominated WTI Swap could work:

The mechanics remain the same. The US WTI Swap quotes are converted in Yen/KL and posted on EOL. Incoming transaction are hedged out against the US WTI Swap and the FX exposure is hedge out manually. 

The Enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ENA. (same as for the US WTI Swap). The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA. (That's nothing new, they already do that.) 

Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development. First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution. ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books. (No EJ books as touched in this transactions). 
The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate. We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market. It is supporting our overall market penetration effort. 
The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group. Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don't see as material. The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with non-Japanese counterparties. In addition, the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJ's from a Japanese point of view. 

I hope this helps to clarify some things. Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information.

Thank you!

Regards,
StN

 We just thought we were going to get this signed. The Confirmations supervisor has some problems as outlined below. Can we fix this in the amendment?  Do you want us to send language? 
I would like to hold off executing this amendment until we can include a warranty provision (including remedies) regarding the accuracy of the ""electronic records of the EOL transactions"" . This is a result of:
?       the current EOL service agreement disclaims all warranties as to the accuracy of the website information (Sec 4.b of the service agreement)

?       the amendment in its current form does not warrant the accuracy of the electronic information, yet it will replace the confirmation, and

?       we are currently experiencing significant problems with the integrity of the data obtained from the website,  which I would have to assume would be the same data that would replace the confirmations.

"(01-406) EXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECU	TION AND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS","November 29, 2001
Notice No. 01-406

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	EXCHANGE TO INTRODUCE HENRY HUB SWAPS; LARGE ORDER EXECUTION
AND EXTENDED MONTHS IN NATURAL GAS FUTURES AND OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced an expanded slate of
natural gas products and services that it plans to introduce on an expedited
basis, including an electronically traded, cleared Henry Hub swaps contract
for the December 3 trading session, which begins with the NYMEX ACCESS

session on Sunday night, December 2; listings of additional natural gas
futures contracts as far as six years out beginning with the NYMEX ACCESS

session tonight; extended natural gas options contracts beginning with the
Monday open outcry session; and large order execution (LOX) in the first two
months of the natural gas futures contract also beginning tomorrow.

The contract specifications for the Henry Hub swaps contract will closely
parallel those of the Henry Hub futures contract other than it will be
financially settled, based on the final settlement price of the Henry Hub
futures contract.  The trading symbol will be NN.  Trading will begin at 7
PM Sunday night, with a pre-opening session beginning at 3 PM.

The Exchange currently lists the natural gas futures contract for 36
consecutive months and will list an additional 36 consecutive months
beginning tomorrow.  The Exchange currently lists 12 consecutive months of
natural gas options and eight additional quarterly contracts on a
March/June/September/December cycle, and, on Monday, will add 12 additional
quarterly contracts on the same cycle.  The Henry Hub swaps contract will be
available for the closest 72 consecutive months.

LOX will be permitted throughout the open outcry sessions, except during the
closing range. Under the new procedures, orders for a minimum of 250
contracts and a maximum of 5,000 contracts will be permitted outside of the
bid/ask spread for smaller trades, as long as the trade is within the
session's maximum price fluctuation limits.

Floor traders wishing to participate in a LOX market on behalf of a customer
or themselves must verbally submit a request for quote (RFQ) to an Exchange
employee, who will act as the LOX book holder, stipulating the delivery
month and number of contracts involved. The book holder will only recognize
initial responses that are for the full amount of the RFQ. Once a response
to the RFQ is formally recognized, the requesting member has 30 seconds to
react to the market.

There will be a $2.50 per contract charge for any RFQ that receives a
responding quote. If the RFQ results in a trade, the fee will be reduced to
$1.50 per contract.

Members trading for their own accounts may participate in a trade subsequent
to the initial response, but the member who first responded with the best
bid or offer for the large order will never receive less than a 50%
allocation of a completed trade.

In addition to formally recognizing the participants involved in a LOX
order, the book holder will be responsible for enforcing time limits,
maintaining records, and ensuring that trades with multiple responding
participants are allocated to the provisions in the rules.

"FW: Setoff and ISDA Section 7(b) Transfer Provision; Comments on New Draft of Master Netting","Rick and David, 

Also give me your analysis wherein the Counterparty receivable financing is more generic, without specific references to contracts but a global reference to receivables in connection with a product type, and assume representations by Counterparty to Bank that do not include setoff rights as any type of ""permitted encumbrance or charge.""  Would the Bank still be put on reasonable inquiry vis a vis the Enron position?

Subject:	Setoff and ISDA Section 7(b) Transfer Provision; Comments on New Draft of Master Netting

Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form regarding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our schedule.

(g)	Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, ""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, ""Y"") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's ""priority"" position (assuming Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setoff right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables. 

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron has made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
 
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignment provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the master agreement and transactions ""as security"".  Please review and advise of any particular language you think should be added.  

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) provision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the end of 7(b), "";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subject [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section].""

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master netting agreement?

Thank you for your patience and understanding concerning the frame relay
equipment issue.  I'm pleased to inform you that the Exchange has made a
final decision on the disposition of this equipment.

Please be advised that AT&T will be contacting you shortly to arrange for
disconnection and removal of the router and modem only for those NYMEX

AT&T's equipment and they will arrange for its pickup.  Users are
responsible for the costs associated with any AT&T equipment that might be
damaged or lost.

All NYMEX ACCESS
 terminal holders must contact their telephone carrier to
arrange for the discontinuance of phone service to their terminal.  Since
the user set up the account with AT&T, they are responsible for contacting
the carrier and making arrangements for this service to be discontinued.
The Exchange will not do this.  This should be completed as quickly as
possible since the Exchange will not pay for any reimbursement costs
incurred after December 31, 2001.

Finally, with reference to the NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 terminal equipment
itself, the Exchange requires that NYMEX ACCESS
 and C-21 frame relay

their intention to return the equipment to the Exchange at their own cost,

"(01-366) Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas","Notice # 01-366
October 31, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division members
All NYMEX Division cleating members

FROM:
J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:
Introduction of EFS Trading in Natural Gas



The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., will begin offering tomorrow
exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions in the first step of its
plans to offer over clearing services to the over-the-counter (OTC) natural
gas market.

This plan will also include the introduction of large order execution in the
natural gas futures market and electronic trading of cleared natural gas
swaps and basis contracts.

We are delighted that we were able to expedite the introduction of this
instrument as the current climate in the natural gas market has served to
reinforce the necessity of credit intermediation.  The liquidity of our
market, combined with a clearinghouse that has half billion dollars
available to participants on each of the Exchange divisions through each
guarantee fund and the respective clearing members, put us in a unique
position to offer these services.

In addition, natural gas futures and options volume in 2000 reached the
equivalent of approximately 230 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and the
notional value of last year's transactions Exchange-wide totaled $3
trillion, or $14 billion per day.

EFS transactions will work similarly to exchange of futures for physical
(EFP) transactions.  Two parties will be allowed to privately negotiate the
execution of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures
transaction on pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The
transaction must involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market
quantities of futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities
and will be permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the
underlying futures contract.  EFS transactions will be permitted to
liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures market positions between the two
parties involved in the transaction.  The Exchange will charge $10 per side
for each EFS transaction.  The clearing member representing each party will
be responsible to notify the Exchange of the amount and type of futures
contracts involved, the price at which the futures transaction should be
cleared, and the identity of the parties involved.

Forward Looking and Cautionary Statements
The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has attempted, wherever possible, to
make statements in good faith , as of the date of this release, by using
words such as anticipate, believes, expects, and words and terms of similar
substance in connection with any discussion of its present and future
operations within the industry. Any forward-looking statements made by, or
on behalf of the Exchange, involve a number of risks, trends, uncertainties,
and other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially,
including; the Exchange=s receipt of the necessary Commodity Futures Trading
Commission approval; timely performance and cooperative effort of exchange
partners; and changes in financial or business conditions at the Exchange.

"RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable Financing","The key question will be whether we can get a QSPE [which is supposed to be brain dead] to amend a document to accomplish this. Section 6.2(c) of Swee'P, L.L.C.'s LLC Agreement provides that:

""(c)	The Principal Managers of the Company, or any one of them, are hereby, and without further action, expressly authorized to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Company, the Transaction Documents, together with (i) any amendments, modifications, or supplements thereto, and restatements thereof, as such Principal Managers, or any one of them, may deem appropriate,""

Alan, lets talk when you have a chance.  [What I would envision is an amendment to the Transfer Agreement that carves out certain account obligors referred to on a schedule from the definition of Receivables -- so we could revise the schedule from time to time as other master netting agreements are executed, and a similar revision to the UCC financing statements.] JNE

Not being aware of all the ins and outs of your transaction, but based upon the description below and the provisions of the master netting agreement, I think the receivables must be removed from step 1 (see Sections 7/11 or the netting agreement); therefore, an amendment is evidently required.

Subject: RE: Master Netting Agreements and Prior Physical Gas Receivable
Financing


	Mary, in step 1 all of the receivables meeting the definition of Receivable are transferred from ENA to Swee'P; in step 2 Swee'P sells an undivided interest in the pool of Receivables to ASCC [CIBC's conduit vehicle]. The September report indicated that PG&E accounted for 3,340,000/167,000,000 th's of ASCC's interest in the pool of receivables [ASCC having an interest of 167,000,000 divided by some larger amount [which amount includes the excess concentration amount, a reserve requirement, etc.]] Swee'P obtained from ENA.  Note that if the PG&E receivable is ""removed"" from step 2, then all that really happens is that no credit is given to Swee'P in the numerator, resulting in a smaller undivided interest in the pool being transferred to ASCC; however, by virtue of the PG&E receivable being transferred from ENA to Swee'P in step 1, the PG&E receivable will always be in the denominator, and ASCC will always buy an undivided interest in the pool which includes the PG&E receivable, it will just buy a smaller percentage interest if it is excluded from the numerator. I need to know what you mean by ""extracting"" the receivable -- if you mean that no credit is obtained by Swee'P in the calculation of the undivided interest that ASCC purchases, then that can be accomplished on the next reinvestment date. If you mean that no undivided interest in the receivable can be transferred to ASCC, then I think it needs to come out of step 1 [so that it is removed from the denominator, not just the numerator], and I think that the only way to do that is by amending the documents.

Per Lisa Mellencamp and based upon visiting with Mark Taylor, extracting the PGE receivables on 10/25, the next regular date, is satisfactory.  Please note that the master netting does not include the PGE utility entity, only the non-utilities.  Joel, you have a copy of the netting agreement showing all parties thereto.  You should check with Hodge re any utility gas contract receivables.

"Re: What's happening?","Mike,

So is the coal group a core group?

As regards job offers, I have not tried as yet. If you recall, I accepted the Enron offer before October 1. And that meant I could not participate in the campus placement process. And the process that started in the first week of October is almost over. My only option it to wait and see and probably take some action in the next semester.

Let's see how things play out!

[IMAGE]   Supreme Court Sits in Different Courthouse as Anthrax Hits Even Closer to Home  American Lawyer Media The U.S. Supreme Court met Monday not in its regular home, but at a nearby federal courthouse, where it may meet for days to come. Anthrax spores have been discovered in the basement of the Supreme Court building in addition to the Court's remote mail facility, where they were found last week.

But starting Thursday, new federal sentencing guidelines will cover such crimes, and the result will be tougher sentences.

After business leaders protested clinic lawsuits aimed at industries, the Louisiana Supreme Court imposed restrictions two years ago.

 << File: RMGsettlementagreement(11-26-01).doc >> Helaine -

Attached is a first draft of the proposed settlement agreement for the
CreditStream product.  I have provided standard provisions in relation to
liabilities, waiver and releases.  Where there are blanks, I am waiting for
additional information and hope to have that soon.  As to Paragraph 7, I
was unable to locate a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement between RMG
and EnronCredit.com from Sept., 2000.  Once located, I will probably
incorporate the confidentiality terminology into the release/settlement.  I
hope to have a copy of this agreement a bit later today.

Please look over the attached and provide any comments or questions you may
have.

Hope you had a safe holiday.

Mark

"RE: International Travel","Thanks for your thoughts Mark.  I may call you as well.  I think we have it
worked out.  I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow.  I am
working on putting together a quick trip out West as a consolation for
Amanda.  She always wanted to see Grand Canyon.  I know that pales in
comparison to a Paris cafe but it will have to do for now.  I am generally
dismissive of the risks of travelling but this event has affected me deeply.
And I think you are right that Amanda hasn't felt that yet.  I would love to
ignore it or downplay it but I can't.

Do you know of any spa/resort type places in the Southwest that would meet
the Hayman standard?  (I know you know what I mean by the Hayman standard).

Thanks again, Bill.

Subject: RE: International Travel


I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.
Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the
airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases
the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations
number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I
will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest
relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we
weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I
don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least
not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police
presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans
while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here
for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans
just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.
The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during
some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly
country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good
to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very
sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and
so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.
Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do
something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.
For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon,
although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will
improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you
since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees
two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of
events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you
aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

Mark

   Mark -- I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket.  I understand
   from
   American that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact
   over
   there?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.

   I want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the
   next
   week and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel
   unsafe
   there?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.

"SLA for Global View Software","Hi Mark,

Attached is a Service Level Agreement for our deal with Global View Software.  Forthcoming will be two attachments - one that gives EOL contact names and numbers and one that outlines the hardware in detail.  I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA.  We would like to see it turned around in a week or so if at all possible.  Global View actually has the hardware and we are in the middle of some user acceptance testing.  Please give me a call if any questions.

Thanks,

The event will take place this Sunday September 30 at O'Flanagan's Pub at 1215 1st Avenue in Manhattan (65th and 1st) starting promptly at 6:00 PM.  There will be live music from several bands.

Due to an overwhelming outpouring of generosity by attorneys at the firm and their friends, we have received as donations many incredible items that we will raffle and auction during a silent auction.  Just a few of the items that we will RAFFLE off on Sunday include, Producers tickets, Knicks tickets, Mets tickets, a Sony PlayStation II and dinners at many NYC restaurants.

Some of the great items that will be available from the SILENT AUCTION are listed below.   If you cannot attend, but would like to participate in the silent auction, we are taking ""sealed auction bids"" in advance of the event.  In other words, you can email your bid to me by Saturday at 2:00 PM and it will be added to the bidding.  Of course, ALL proceeds will go directly to sanctioned funds established for the rescue workers' families.   Bids should be sent to  Mark Cheffo.  The silent auction will end on Sunday night and winners will be notified on Monday.   Thank you in advance for your support.  Note that the listed ticket prices are the face value and do not include the additional ticketmaster or tele-charge fees paid by the ticket donors.

"RE: 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol","
Hello Kimberly and Emily, 
I agree that the Euro provisions should be separated from the other group of proposed annexes to the protocol because the Euro subject matter relates to practical issues which must be addressed by the Jan. 1 deadline.  The majority of the other annexes relate to substantive and material changes to the way many existing provisions of the 1992 Master Agreement work (except for, among other things, the Force Majeure provisions which are mostly not addressed in the 1992 Master Agreement. . . . . a possible reason for separating the Force Majeure annex from the rest).  As far as the annexes which would make substantive changes to current provisions of the 1992 agreement, I understand from your email that ISDA is now proposing to role them into a ""new"" master agreement rather than issuing them in protocol form.  Would it not be a good litmus test to judge the acceptance by the ISDA membership (and otherwise) of each of the proposed annexes by issuing them in protocol form in order to see who and how many sign up for them?
Thank you. 
Best regards,

Subject: 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol 
This email is to update you on the status of the 2001 ISDA Master Agreement 
Protocol (the ""Protocol"").  As part of the Protocol, there were four annexes 
that addressed the disappearance of the 12 national currency units on 
January 1, 2002 and the introduction of the euro.  These four annexes have 
been separated from the Protocol and published on our website on September 
24 as the 2001 Euro Protocol.  The adherence period for the 2001 Euro 
Protocol is September 24 to November 30, 2001.  It was important to move 
forward with the 2001 Euro Protocol, given the specific nature of the timing 
of the introduction of the euro. 
With respect to Annexes 1 through 8, we propose drafting a new ISDA Master 
Agreement rather than moving forward with a Protocol.  The continuing debate 
on the details of Annexes 1 to 8, the relevance of the Protocol for these 
provisions and the interest in moving forward with a new ISDA Master 
Agreement are some of the reasons for this recommendation.  An extraordinary 
amount of effort has gone into preparing the Protocol and will provide a 
strong basis for proceeding with a new ISDA Master Agreement.  Please let me 
know what your thoughts are on this suggested approach. 
With respect to Annex 9, the Force Majeure Annex, we propose posting a Form 
of Amendment and the Force Majeure provisions (as well as the Commentary) on 
our website.  This would allow firms to incorporate such language into their 
Master Agreements on the basis of bilateral negotiation.  Any views you may 
have in light of the events of September 11 would be welcome.  
Lastly, with respect to Annex 10, the Tax Protocol, our Tax Committee will 
be contacted on Tuesday to determine how to proceed with respect to those 
issues.  Any views on this issue would also be welcome. 
Please contact me as soon as possible to share your views.  I can be reached 
by email or by phone at 212-332-1203. 
Thank you in advance.

Subject:	RE: Derivatives Contract

I have revised and attached clean and blacklined drafts of the Confirmation and the Terms and Conditions distributed on Friday (attached to Brent's message below), but have some questions about paragraph (d) of the Fallback Methodology section of the Confirmation as written in the prior draft:

	(1) The section titled ""Premium Payment Details""  (page 1) calls for payment of the Premium (presumably, by Counterparty or the buyer of the option) two 	Business Days following execution of the confirmation.  Is this in lieu of or in addition to the Premium payment called for in paragraph (d)?  I think it works 	only if the Premium payment made two days following execution of the Confirmation was made by Counterparty to EES (the Floating Amount Payor) and 	the payment in (d) is intended to be a refund of the Premium back to Counterparty by EES. 

	(2) Paragraph (d) makes reference to the higher of ""two Cash Settlement Amount Calculations.""   There appears to be only one Cash Settlement Amount 	calculation (an option versus eg. a swap).  Is ""Cash Settlement Amount"" intended to include the Premium?

	(3) I think the proviso at the end of paragraph (b) applies to paragraph (d) as well (and to the entire Confirmation) and perhaps should come after (d).  

The comments in the Fallback Methodolody section reflect my suggestions as well as my understanding of the mechanics  of that section.   Also, to make the document easier to review, and because it is the most likely scenario, the revised draft assumes EES is the seller of the option (i.e. the Floating Amount Payer), and our Customer the buyer of the option (Fixed Amount Payer).   Please let me have your comments ASAP. 

We will have a final draft product for general distribution after we incorporate any revisions (including any comments from the addressees) into the attached drafts.


Thanks,
Ed

Here is the revised blacklined draft of the confirmation.  Please read the Determination of Missing Data section very carefully.  I have incorporated the last two subsections into (b) and (d) for simplification.  I am also attaching the Terms and Conditions that Ed finalized yesterday.  Please forward to anyone else who needs to review this document and let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Ed, can you fill in the missing numbers in the letterhead?

"2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol","This email is to update you on the status of the 2001 ISDA Master Agreement
Protocol (the ""Protocol"").  As part of the Protocol, there were four annexes
that addressed the disappearance of the 12 national currency units on
January 1, 2002 and the introduction of the euro.  These four annexes have
been separated from the Protocol and published on our website on September
24 as the 2001 Euro Protocol.  The adherence period for the 2001 Euro
Protocol is September 24 to November 30, 2001.  It was important to move
forward with the 2001 Euro Protocol, given the specific nature of the timing
of the introduction of the euro.

With respect to Annexes 1 through 8, we propose drafting a new ISDA Master
Agreement rather than moving forward with a Protocol.  The continuing debate
on the details of Annexes 1 to 8, the relevance of the Protocol for these
provisions and the interest in moving forward with a new ISDA Master
Agreement are some of the reasons for this recommendation.  An extraordinary
amount of effort has gone into preparing the Protocol and will provide a
strong basis for proceeding with a new ISDA Master Agreement.  Please let me
know what your thoughts are on this suggested approach.

With respect to Annex 9, the Force Majeure Annex, we propose posting a Form
of Amendment and the Force Majeure provisions (as well as the Commentary) on
our website.  This would allow firms to incorporate such language into their
Master Agreements on the basis of bilateral negotiation.  Any views you may
have in light of the events of September 11 would be welcome.

Lastly, with respect to Annex 10, the Tax Protocol, our Tax Committee will
be contacted on Tuesday to determine how to proceed with respect to those
issues.  Any views on this issue would also be welcome.

Please contact me as soon as possible to share your views.  I can be reached
by email or by phone at 212-332-1203.

Thank you in advance.

A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):

1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no ""no-names"" advice on these issues).

Mark,

We have a slight change in the priorities for the ConfirmLogic items.  The companies listed below are now in order of priority (assuming a Nov. 15-16 deadline, if possible).  There are no changes to the dates for the other items.

	Cargill
	Entergy-Koch (it is my understanding that you have one more review to complete before you release these amendments)
	Bank of America
	Williams

Due to the complexities around Morgan Stanley, they should fall off the list for now.  Doug or Kathryn will let you know if the situation changes.

Thanks for the dates.  I will work to meet them, but want you to know that I will be out of the office at a training class on both the 13th and 14th.  The ConfirmLogic items that are listed for those days will have to be due on Nov.15.  Further, I understand that the Morgan Stanley agreements may not be ISDA's.  If this is the case, I will not be working on them and would have to have others in our group do the work (which is not a priority at this time).

"Lay It On the Line Survey Results","Recently, I asked you to ""Lay It On the Line"" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	""Walking the talk"" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:
---	pay and benefits
---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

Subject: Energy Market - ISDA Statement
Importance: High


As part of its efforts to assist the markets resolve certain issues arising
out of this week's events, ISDA has been asked to consider the implications
of certain continuing problems with futures exchanges and price source
publications for commodity derivatives.

Attached in the form of a draft statement from ISDA are a series of
proposals that have been made by a number of institutions active in the OTC
commodity derivatives area to resolve pricing difficulties.

We welcome your comments on these proposals.  The purpose of this
distribution is to encourage all participants in the markets for these
products to consider the issues raised and, we hope, to come to some
consensus position that can be reflected in a statement in the style of the
attached draft by ISDA.  Please send any comments to Kimberly Summe
(ksumme@isda.org) as soon as possible on Friday morning.

Please contact me at ISDA at 212-332-1203 if you have any questions.

Kimberly Summe
General Counsel

"Re: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry","In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

"SDR - 2001 ISDA Master Agreement Protocol","In response to my email of September 24 regarding the 2001 ISDA Master
Agreement Protocol, I received responses from only seven (7) institutions.
No clear indication resulted from those seven responses (four in favor of
proceeding with the Protocol; three in favor of working on a new Master
Agreement with no Protocol).  Before ISDA proceeds in either direction, it
would be helpful to have wider market input.  I should point out that ISDA
intends to work on a new 2002 or 2003 Master Agreement; timing is the only
issue - whether the process begins imminently or nine months from now.

The benefits of proceeding with the Protocol is that it takes advantage of
the considerable time and effort that has been invested in the initiative to
date.  While the rate of adherence may be diminished somewhat given the
continuing skepticism over certain annexes, the Protocol remains a
convenient and effective way for institutions to amend their Master
Agreements.  It also provides ISDA with some indication of the level of
market interest in going forward with drafting a new Master Agreement and
what provisions may be problematic.

On the other hand, dissension has been expressed with respect to some of the
Protocol's annexes, namely, the expansion of the Default under Specified
Transactions, the involuntary insolvency provisions and the Replacement
Value concept.  In addition, there has been skepticism regarding the
appropriateness of proceeding with the Protocol when the rate of adherence
may not necessarily generate a new, widely-accepted standard for market
practice.  To a lesser degree, those firms that amend their Master
Agreements via the Protocol may encounter certain issues when the new Master
Agreement is ultimately produced.

If you have not already contacted me with your response,  I would be
grateful if you could let me know your institution's position as soon as
possible.

Thank you in advance.

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.

On the state file.  The CSP of each state added together is way above 25,000.  Why is this?  How should I look at this CSP?  Is there a discount factor that will be applied to get down to the 25,000 at the end of 2002.  If so, what is it?

Should I add them all together and get a percent per state?  And then multiply the percent by 25,000 to determine the state's CSP at the end of 2002?  Please advise.

Michael - I haven't heard back from Joel yet on a call date & time, but here is some of the info I promised.  Attached is the latest information I have on the state allocations, including their total trading budgets:

 << File: State.htm >> 


Also attached, is the Section 126 Non-EGU allocations:

 << File: Sec. 126 NonEGU affected units.pdf >> 

I am pretty sure this is all the non-EGUs that will affected in those states under the SIP Call, but am double checking just to be completely sure.

I am still working on a date that the allowances have to be parked in the compliance supplement pool in 2002 to be valid in 2003.  

I'll let you know as soon as I have some more answers.

Per the discussion with Alan Aronowitz and Nony Flores to include Global Markets in the project, they have decline due to time constraint in gathering requirements.  However, if they decide otherwise, they can be added during the elaboration phase.  

In going forward, I will need approval from you all to begin the project.  Instead of a written signature for the Statement of Work - Trading Agreements Project, send me your approval via email.  Please copy Betty Broadfoot when sending your approval.

"New Project Direction","Mark,
I can use your advise on a few new projects that I am working on.

1.  The weather desk is trying to roll out a HDD Swap for Calgary by Monday.  Most of the anticipated buyers of the product will be Canadian counterparties ECC has masters with.  The desk originally thought that we need to create a GTC for Enron Canada using the ENA weather GTC.  Because if the time issues involved in creating a new GTC (fixing all the things that are wrong with the ENA form) I looked for a new way to deal with this issue.  I think I found it in section 3(d) of the ETA which provides that the Enron counterparty to a particular transaction will be the Enron Entity they have a master with that covers that type of transaction.  I believe this provision was a stroke of genius designed for just this type of scenario.  I can prepare the long description to specify the Enron entity as ""the applicable Enron entity"" and if there is a master then the Enron Entity is the one with the master pursuant to Section 3(d) of the ETA and if there is no master the ETA says the GTC applies and the GTC specifies that ENA is the counterparty.  Do you think this works?

2.  I was contacted by someone at McKinsey & Company yesterday who is working with the weather desk to develop a Bermuda Transformer Commercial Structure to partner up with the Insurance market to provide some capital to our weather trading desk.  I have been told that conceptually it will be a Jedi type arrangement.  I have been asked to help them think through the issues and coordinate with the other attorneys who work on these types of issues.  I do not want to get too deep into the structuring of this investment vehicle myself without the appropriate legal group involved.  Would this be something Jordan Mintz's group would handle or would this be something that Lance Schuler's group would develop?  I thought I might want to talk to Julia Murrey (or Cristina Mordant or Carol St. Clair) to see what issues cropped up in the development of Jedi I and Jedi II (or maybe I should just talk to whatever lawyer is currently handling these structures).  What are your thoughts on how to move forward?

3.  The other rush deal is a financing deal out of Jordan's group.  The deal I helped look at that was a physical forward using ISDA type language is now a financial deal (a series of Total Return Swaps) that needs to close next Friday.  I will go to a meeting in the morning to try and get more information on the structure.  Angela Davis who has worked on the Total Return swap deals has offered to help me pilot this through.  Sara thought I should check with you to make sure you don't have a problem with me taking on one of these deals.  I am going to try and make sure they have Danny Sullivan from A&K working on the deal since he is the most knowledgeable lawyer on this type of structure.  

I hope all goes well with your return flight plans.

"Ontario Power Generation Swap","Mary, we are under a good deal of commercial pressure to execute the power swap with Ontario Power Generation by the end of 3rd quarter.  I understand the swap is for 3 years after Ontario Market Opening, with Enron as fixed price payor (Cdn. $50) and OPG as floating price payor.  I also understand that OPG has provided their comments on the documentation, and would appreciate if we made it a top priority to review and respond to their comments as soon as possible.  I understand that there may be a significant number of matters ongoing for quarter end, as well as because of the recent events.  However, the draft ISDA has been outstanding for a considerable period and, as mentioned, we have commercial pressure to execute the transaction.  If it would expedite matters, perhaps we could document under an Omnibus GTC (although OPG will likely have similar comments which will need to be addressed) or we could assign another lawyer to completing the documentation, including Chris Gaffney.  Please let me know.

Dale --

I have been working with Jeff Dellapina at Chase on potential revisions to the April '99 prepay -- he has requested an amendment to the original margin agreement.  Currently, we are required to post margin under the swaps once a month.  Chase has requested a change to daily margining.  This change is being driven by our current credit issues, especially with the banks.  I have spoken with Evan Ward at APEA who is working with their lawyers on this.

I was wondering if I should work through you on this or someone in Houston (as you had worked on the original transaction).  Let me know your thoughts when you get the chance and I appreciate your help.

"RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap","Dear Frank,

Many thanks for helping out on this.  Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  

There has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.

I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  

Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me).

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.

Re the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. 

I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to ""foreign"" products, we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.

Re Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.



   

Thanks Frank.

Subject:	EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap 

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

"FW: Power Demand w/ECC - EOL","Before we get too far along in redrafting the Alberta Power Pool pricing index, I have some thoughts on the discussion below.  

The first point that should be kept in mind is that the Index language provided to you originally by Dianne Seib (which I have reproduced again below) is the language currently used in ECC's physical and financial power transactions in Alberta and has wide-spread industry acceptance.  I do not believe that rewriting it is in the best interests of ECC, even if it is just for transactions between ECC and RMT, as inconsistency, particularly what could be significant inconsistency, between the calculation of pricing could cause problems with ECC's ability to properly manage its position as well as regarding accounting and operational matters.  

Also, I am unclear as to how the original language provided to you by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get someone to the specific pricing reference.  In Alberta, we have always referenced the ""Actual/Forecast"" pricing table as opposed to the ""Historical"" pricing table and if the URL that is referenced in the original description provided to you by Dianne Seib is inserted into your internet browser it takes you directly to the ""Actual/Forecast"" table.  Then, the column and row references set forth in the original description take you to the specific price point.  Therefore, I am unclear as to how the previous description provided by Dianne Seib is not specific enough to get you to the actual price point.  As far as using the ""Actual/Forecast"" table as opposed to the ""Historical"" table, I believe that both tables get you to the same point, given that, by the end of each day, the ""Actual/Forecast"" table sets forth the actual pricing for each hour of that day.  

In addition, I do not believe that it is correct to use a price averaged over the day as opposed to the actual price for each hour during the day (as is contemplated in the original description).  Perhaps it is different when using the index for weather derivatives, but, when entering into power swaps or physical power buy/sells, it is essential to use the actual price for each hour rather than an average because (a) the determination period is each hour, not each day, and (b) more importantly it is very common to have a power product that only relates to certain hours of a day (ie. non-peak hours or peak hours) or has a term of less than one day, in which case a daily average would be unacceptable.  

Finally, it is necessary to include the language ""provided that the Floating Price shall be corrected to reflect any ""Pool Price Errors"" as may be posted on such web page, or otherwise communicated, from time to time by the Power Pool of Alberta"" at the end of the description to deal with any pricing errors posted by the Power Pool.  

Just to ensure we are talking about the same language, the current language in use in Alberta for the Alberta Power Pool Index is as follows:

The actual hourly price of Electricity as published (in final, not forecast, form) by the Power Pool of Alberta in the table entitled ""Actual/Forecast"" reported for the applicable day in the column for ""Actual Posted Pool Price"" and in the row(s) for the applicable Determination/Calculation Period, on the Power Pool of Alberta internet web page currently located at www.powerpool.ab.ca/Market/Reports/ActualForecastReportServlet; provided that the Floating Price shall be corrected to reflect any ""Pool Price Errors"" as may be posted on such web page, or otherwise communicated, from time to time by the Power Pool of Alberta.

Therefore, I am very concerned with the redraft of this language.  Our preference is to retain the language as is currently in use, as we believe it is accurate and specific, works properly for physical and financial power transactions and has wide-spread acceptance in the Alberta Power market.  If there are specific nuances arising from the fact that we are dealing with a weather derivative tied to the Power Pool Index, I would prefer that they be addressed elsewhere in the confirmation rather than redrafting the standard Power Pool Index language.

We need to add the definition of Load (how it is calculated). I have asked the Power Pool of Alberta to publish the definition and we put the same in our contract as well. 

Brent/Diane: I will send you the defintion as soon as I get it. I have made one but it needs to bve consistent with Power Pool of Alberta.

Diane,

Thanks for the correction to the content and the language. There are just a couple of minor edits that I would propose to the language below - these are highlighted.

The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool loads for all hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period.  The  Floating Amount shall be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the ""Average"" daily ""Pool Demand (MW)"" for each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period set forth in the ""Power Pool of Alberta Operations Report"" for each relevant month found in the ""Pool Monthly Summary"" Report of the ""Historical"" ""Reports"" section published by the Alberta Power Pool on its official web site currently located at <http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/>, , or any successor thereto. The transaction is for the average of hourly pool demands on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am).  ""Delivery Day"" means each day during the Calculation P eriod

Thanks,
Vivek

All,  

Please take a look at the attached language proposed for the Floating Rate for the EOL  Alberta Hourly deals with ECC.  The changes incorporate a more specific route to the referenced data:
The Floating Amount shall be the arithmetic average of the hourly Alberta Power Pool loads for all hours on each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period.  The  Floating Amount shall be calculated by taking the arithmetic average of the ""Average"" daily ""Pool Demand (MW)"" for each Delivery Day during the Calculation Period set forth in the ""Power Pool of Alberta Monthly Report"" for each relevant month found in the ""Pool Monthly Summary"" page of the ""Historical"" ""Reports"" section published by the Alberta Power Pool on its official web site currently located at <http://www.powerpool.ab.ca/>, , or any successor thereto. The transaction is for the average of hourly pool demands on each Delivery Day beginning with the hour ending 0100 (12:00 am) and concluding with the hour ending 2400 (12:00 am).  ""Delivery Day"" means each day during the Calculation P eriod


 

Please let me know if this accurately reflects the location of the data, and if you agree to use this language.

Thanks,
Diane

Eduardo,
Here is how we get to the data as at this point in time (I don't know how changes in wesbites are handled):

http:www.powerpool.ab.ca
Click on 'Reports'
Click on 'Historical'
Scroll the box to 'Pool Monthly Summary' , choose the month, year, and click OK

The title of the relevant page is :

Power Pool of Alberta
Operations Report for Month, Year

Pls let me know if there are any questions.

Eduardo,  

I spoke with Brent Hendry regarding these deals and we need to have some clarification on the Floating Amount language.  Conceptually it is OK, but when you go to the website http://www.powerpool.ab.ca , there is no specific heading titled ""Power Pool of Alberta Hourly Load Data"" - unless we're just missing where on the website it is located.  Either way, if we're going to be specific, we need to give the exact location of the data, not just a generalized concept - if it is buried somewhere in one of the pages, we need to give adequate info in order to get to that page.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

"(01-398) REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES","December 4, 2001
Notice No. 01-398

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	REMINDER ON EFS REQUIREMENTS FOR NATURAL GAS FUTURES
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Previously, in Notice to Members #01-366, the Exchange announced a new
program that commenced on November 1, 2001 and that permits the exchange of
swaps for futures in Natural Gas futures contracts.  As an informational
follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text of the new
LOX rule.

				AMENDMENTS TO NYMEX RULE 6.21A

(Asterisks indicate additions; brackets indicate deletions.)

 Rule 6.21A.  EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, SWAP
TRANSACTIONS  (Pilot Program)

(A) (1) An exchange of futures for, or in connection with, a swap (EFS)
consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; a swap transaction and
a futures transaction.  At the time such transaction is effected, the buyer
and seller of the futures must be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of
the swap.  The swap component shall involve the commodity underlying the
futures contract (or a derivative, by-product or related product of such
commodity).  The quantity covered by the swap must be approximately
equivalent to the quantity covered by the futures contracts.  The swap
component of an EFS transaction must comply with the applicable CFTC swap
regulatory requirements.  The initial term of the pilot program shall be
three years from the effective date of this Rule 6.21A.

	(2) Eligible Contracts and Transactions.  EFS transactions may be
effected only for transactions in the Exchange's Brent crude oil futures
contract  * or in the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures contract (for a period
of six months following implementation of the pilot program for Natural Gas
EFS transactions) * .

(B)(1)  The report of an EFS transaction shall be given on the Floor of the
Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EFS transactions *
involving the Brent contract * are permitted until the close of trading on
the last trading day in the expiring contract month [of the applicable
contract(s)].  * (3) EFS transactions involving Natural Gas contract are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the expiring contract month. *

(C)  A report of such EFS transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EFS as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the swap component of the EFS
complied with the applicable CFTC swap regulatory requirements at the time
the EFS was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the
EFS has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such
change, the kind and quantity of the futures, the price at which the futures
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EFS on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EFS transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EFS, including a master
swap agreement and any supplements thereto, shall be obtained by the
Clearing Members from the buyer or seller and made available by the Clearing
Members for examination by the Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or
seller is a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may obtain the information
directly from such person(s).

(2) For [all NYMEX Division contracts] * the Brent contract *, no EFS that
is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting swap
transaction may be transacted during Regular Trading Hours at any time that
NYMEX offers trading in its contracts, unless trading in a market is halted,
such as during a physical emergency.   * For the Natural Gas contract, no
EFS that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second, offsetting
swap transaction may be transacted at any time. *

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EFS transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EFS transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EFS
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange's
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EFS pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange's Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EFS on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EFS information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

"U. S. Court of Appeals Fifth Judicial Circuit: Event Notification System.","
                  ANNOUNCING THE EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM


Because we have your e-mail address, we are TESTING a system which offers you
the opportunity to receive automatic e-mail notification of certain events
taking place in your 5th Circuit appeals. In brief, we send you an e-mail
notifying you when we:

        1. Issue a briefing notice;
        2. File and rule on motions to extend the time to file a brief, or to
        suspend briefing times;
        3. File briefs;
        4. File and act on a petition for rehearing.

You can see a complete listing of the notification events by clicking on the
link below.

          http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/attyemail/eventlist.htm

                    What does the notice look like?

You receive the publicly available docket text for these events from our
automated case processing system. You can see a sample by clicking on the
link below. This is the ONLY information you receive. You still have to access
PACERNET to view the entire docket sheet. For those events where we normally
send you a paper document, e.g. a briefing notice, you will still receive that
paper notice.

                    What is the benefit to me?

You will save time and money by not having to check your case's status on
PACERNET, and will not have to call our office to see if we have filed your or
your opponent's brief, to find out when your briefing time begins to run, or
if a rehearing petition has been filed, etc. This service is designed to benefit
you and our office. If however, we find that we are expending more resources by
operating the event notification system because we receive more telephone calls
or electronic messages etc. we will discontinue the service.

            How much does the event notification service cost?
The service is free.

                    How do I sign up for the service?

You must:

        1. Be a member of the 5th Circuit Bar;
        2. Have provided us your current e-mail address;
        3. Sign up by clicking on the  link below and filling out the required
information, or by going to our website http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov and
clicking on the ""event notification"" link. Note, that you can elect to start
the service now, delay receiving the service, but be left on our invitation
list, or elect not to participate and be removed from our invitation list.
You can also change your e-mail address and this will change it throughout our
automated system.

          http://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/email.exe?prid=38379

                    What if I want to stop the service?

You can discontinue the service at any time by selecting the ""event notification
link"" or our ""website"", entering your social security number and then selecting
the either of the options that de-register you from the service.

                    What if the court needs to stop the service?

This is a test service. If we find that running the event notification program
strains our limited resources, we may terminate the test.

On November 9, we sent out a draft statement of market practice addressing
the closing of NYMEX on November 23, 2001.  We asked for feedback to that
draft statement, and to date, the firms responding back to ISDA have
indicated a preference for not proceeding with publication of the statement.
The reason cited is that the NYMEX announcement was made before most swaps
began to price out.  Accordingly, there was no perceived need to move
forward with the statement.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

This will include a reporting of which companies have ISDA Agreements, ENA Agreements, Counterparty Agreements, or No agreements in place which should give us a more accurate idea of where our hang ups will be in the legal process.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks

Forrest

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

I was searching your website for capabilities on emissions trading. I
understand you conduct and enhance market information as well as establish
custom solutions that enable environmental compliance. I was wondering if
you an provide some information on your services, and what the current

Most importantly, I was wondering if you have available data on cost
savings for Enron itself as well as others in the industry.

Thank you for your help - I look forward to your reponse.

Dear Alan,

This is the feedback I got from the guys re types of deals they are thinking about now.  

1 - Product: Crude and Products, LPG, LNG, Naphtha, Power
2 - Transaction: Buy/Sell of Swap, Cap, Floor, No-cost Collar 
3 - Structuring - for various products - purchase, prepayment and tolling 

Also, wonder if there are any inventory finance term sheets / contracts (for taking inventory off balance sheet).

Whatever you can lay your hands on easily will be fine - as they do more relationship building with counterparts in Houston, I guess they will also be able to ask the people there directly as well.  We hope to be getting more people out of Houston here ourselves too.

Thanks Alan,

Jane

Thanks Vela.  My office address is fine.

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems
generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose
power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional
items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical
repairs and replacements?
5.  Finally, and I suppose of least importance, I'm not thrilled with
the teak-look deck or the blue cabin sole.  Any hope of a manufacturing
change?

Thanks again and I'm looking forward to seeing you in Ft. Lauderdale!

Mark

I received this from the Tokyo office.  
John - I am not sure what book this will go it.  Could you check and see if EOL / Nowlan is aware of transaction if it will be part of our books?
Sheila - The deal discusses much interaction w/ Gary Hickerson on the FX side.  Are you aware?
Angelo - Looks like they want to settle via ENA.  Are you on board w/ this?
Michael - from a legal aspect, is ENA set up for this type of trade?

Michelle,

Sorry for calling you at home yesterday.

Please find attached the documentation as promised.

As Jan-Erland mentioned, the transaction is very straight forward. It is basically the same product as the existing 24/7 USD WTI Swap. The only difference is the contract currency which is JPY. 
The floating price in the transaction once it is determined needs to be converted into JPY. To do this we use the mid of the Bid and Offer FX rate published by the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. You can find this FX rate on Reuters (page TKFF). As ENA will be counterparty in this transaction you will probably be involved in the settlement. What we wanted to make sure is that you feel happy in getting all relevant numbers for a smooth settlement.

A quick response from you side would be highly appreciated.
Thank you!

Kind Regards,
Stefan Niesler

I had a good visit with her on the issues.  She advised that she is on a task force to add amendments to the revised 9 in Delaware and thought the group might entertain favorably an exception for master netting agreements from the anti-restriction/assignment receivable issue.  She will work on this for us if we want her to.  I think we should--at least it would be a start and an example.  Do you think there would be great risk in applying Delaware law to the master netting agreements rather than New York?  Let's talk.  Call me Monday.

"RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap","Stefan,

Sorry I didn't respond sooner; it's been really hectic around here.

The GTC looks fine; it's the standard GTC for ENA financial products.

The product descriptions generally look fine as well.  One question I have, however, is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ (apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY) from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA?

Also, the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that: 

""the products are part of Enron Japan's overall effort to extend Enron's crude and products business to Japan.  It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements.""  

Pursuant to our previous discussions and e-mails, I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products.  If this is not the case, we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product (e.g., such as marketing).  Please confirm what the facts are going to be (as they currently stand).

Best regards,
Susan

Below are the documents Jane sent to Legal HOU for approval. 
As you see we intent to be live by Thursday. We hope to have the documents in the system later today (Wed. your time). Could you take a look at the documents and let Jane/me know if you see any issues in signing off on the product? We might want to ask you for sign-off by tomorrow.

Thanks!

Subject:	RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap 
Importance:	High

Dear Frank,

Many thanks for helping out on this.  Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  

There has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.

I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  

Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me).

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.

Re the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. 

I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to ""foreign"" products, we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.

Re Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.

As just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this. But, I do want to warn you that everyone here, including Frank, is engaged in a number of high priority projects related to, among other things, entering into master netting agreements and the like to manage the credit issues affecting the Company. Accordingly, the timetable for a reply may not be in line with your expectations.

Jane, I noted that the draft of the GTCs had a glitch in the Business Day definition. You should resend to Frank.

Subject:	EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap 

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

"RE: ConfirmLogic Target Customer List-Legal Entity Name","
Sara:

I am following up with you regarding a timetable for the top 20 customers.  Per our conversation last Friday we had discussed that you would coordinate with the other lawyers to review the top 20 list and draft amendments for using CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module for the purpose of confirmations.  

The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.

If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

Thanks, 
KC

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,
Diane

"Re: Thanksgiving","We are having Thanksgiving dinner here at our house.  Saturday, if the
weather is decent, you might be interested in seeing Pyramid Hill, a
sculpture park.   It isn't open on Friday.  Friday we might go to one or
more of the art museums in town, or there is a fairly new aquarium over
in Kentucky we haven't seen yet.  So I guess casual is the theme for the
weekend.  There is a show at the Aronoff Center called, ""Blast.""  Have
you heard anything about it?  Dad's boss and wife went and liked it a
lot.  It sounds something like a cross between a marching band and
Riverdance, if you can imagine it.  If that sounds interesting to you, we
will see if we can get tickets for Friday night.  But that could  be just
dressy casual, I should think.

"FW: Master Agreement - Form","Thank y'all so much for your help on this.  We are trying to improve the language relating to the termination payment (Section 5.4) in the bandwidth trading master.  The old version had a very complicated and repetitive formula that tried to reflect replacement costs but in practice did not do so (I will not go into why here).  Based on some ISDA materials sent to me by Elizabeth Sager, as well as the benefit of the trading forms in some of our other businesses, we have come up with the  attached.  I would be so grateful if you could give me some feedback on this 5.4 as soon as you can because we are a bit strapped in producing agreements.  

As I mentioned to Mark on the phone today, I am also trying to work out how critical is the provision allowing for payment by the non-defaulting party to the defaulting party.  As we know, most of the time a non-defaulting party would not elect to terminate if they thought they were going to have to make a payment, but given our strictly physical, not overly liquid market at the moment, this provision has the old time telecoms companies with their eyeballs swivelling around in their sockets (of course the agreement as a whole is a bit of a shock to them, but this seems to be the provision they cannot get their brains around).  Although I am not necessarily suggesting we take this feature out of the form, I would just like your thoghts on whether we have any flexibility to delete it where necessary.

Finally, I note that our form does not have any provision to suspend delivery if the buyer is not paying.  Again, given the physical delivery character of this market, I would recommend we add such a feature.

I will anxiously await your feedback...And again, many thanks.

"Chiricahua Assignments","I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need to assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These two entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intended that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions directly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a term that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is that some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chiricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December and the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the process to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal in broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process please call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement, legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspective.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA trades to Chiricahua III and V entities.  

  

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be entered into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These are based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be delivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolutions passed?

  

I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into between the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or the document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the document by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Chiricahua III

      

Chiricahua V

      

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentation.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or process of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.

Regards,
Brent

"Counterparty Guarantor Addendum to Adoption Agreement","Various discussions took place Friday afternoon as to advisability of inserting a provision designed to bind (or at least make an attempt to bind ) current Counterparty Guarantors to obligations under the Adoption Agreement/ERMT Master Agreements.  

A quick fix that ""hopefully"" does not significantly disrupt the work you may have already done on your Adoption Agreements is to insert the language contained in the attached document just below the signature lines of all Adoption Agreements, only in those cases where the Master being adopted is currently supported by a guaranty issued by Counterparty's parent or other credit support provider/guarantor.  The required revisions to the form language should be fairly self-explanatory, but please call me with any questions.

If you see problems with the specific language (not the idea) of the Addendum, please call me ASAP. 

Thanks for your understanding and assistance,

Steve

The paragraph will provide for the adoption of the terms of that guaranty for purposes of the ERMT Master and necessitate the signature of the guarantor on the Adoption Agreement.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.

Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it ""reinserts"" the Schedule C with Credit information.

"Setoff and ISDA Section 7(b) Transfer Provision; Comments on New Draft of Master Netting","Item 1.  Please refer to Section 7, particularly 7(b), of the ISDA form regarding transfer of receivables and the following setoff language from our schedule.

(g)	Setoff.  (A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date the Non-defaulting Party or the non-Affected Party (in either case, ""X"") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party (in either case, ""Y"") in Dollars or any other currency by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed in Dollars or any other currency by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates (irrespective of place of payment or booking office of the obligation) under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this Section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section, ""Owed"" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.
Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted.  If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.  This setoff provision shall be without limitation and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, offset, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which X or any of X's Affiliates is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represents and acknowledges that the rights set forth in this Section are an integral part of this Agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  Each of the parties further acknowledges that it is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to this Section.
(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party, as the case may be, shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party or Affected Party any amount under Section 6(e) until the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever (whether pursuant to Specified Indebtedness as defined herein or otherwise) of the Defaulting Party or Affected Party to make any payments to the Non-defaulting Party or non-Affected Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date hereof have been fully and finally satisfied.

The following are three areas of questions.

A.  Should a Counterparty effect an assignment of receivables under Section 7(b) for a financing to Bank, what is Enron's ""priority"" position (assuming Bank has filed a financing statement)?  Is the analysis below correct?

1.  Bank takes receivable assignment under contract subject to Enron setoff rights because Bank would be held to actual knowledge of the express setoff right in the contract under which it is taking the receivables. 

2.  Is there any method by which the Bank can prime Enron (assuming Enron has made no public filings) without Enron's written consent?
 
B.  Assume a master netting agreement is in place.  I believe our assignment provisions protect us and are more prohibitive than the ISDA; however, we may want to expressly cite assignment of receivables rather than the master agreement and transactions ""as security"".  Please review and advise of any particular language you think should be added.  

C.  Do you have any suggested language that we might add to the form 7(b) provision via our schedule, or is it necessary?   For example, adding at the end of 7(b), "";provided, any such assignment shall be made expressly subject [and subordinate] to this Agreement, including, without limitation, all rights of [ENA] under Section 6 and [reference setoff section].""

Item 2.  Can I get any other comments on the revised draft of master netting agreement?

This is a brief overview of what the tax group is trying to accomplish overall but does not really explain why assigning the derivative positions from ENA or entering into new weather derivative positions in the Chiricahua entities allows Enron to save 500mm in taxes.

"EBS Master Agreement","Bob,

We have updated our EBS Master Agreement, so made some conforming changes to the EOL (with Credit) and EOL (without Credit) GTCs.  Please find them attached.  I have also revised the product descriptions that I have to make sure that the language was consistent (although I was given a number of versions to work from).  Let me know if you have questions about any of these changes or if you have any questions about additional changes to EBS info on EOL that may be required.  All the Best!

Cynthia

Subject:	RE: Enron Email (Goldman Sachs/J Aron)

You asked me to consider whether there would be any advantage to Enron in
entering into this agreement, given the limitations we discussed yesterday.

My conclusion is that the agreement would assist Enron in the event of a
default by a member of the Goldman Sachs group and there is nothing, as a
matter of English law at least, that would make it imprudent to enter into
the agreement.

The reason why I think the agreement assists Enron is that, absent a winding
up of a counterparty under English law, the courts will generally uphold
contractual set-off arrangements. There are obvious advantages to having an
arrangement under which if one member of the Goldman Sachs group experiences
credit problems, Enron can close out all its positions at the same time and
set them off against each other. It is true that if one of the
counterparties is subject to English law winding up proceedings the set-off
will not be effective (because only ""mutual"" obligations can be set off
against each other and this requires two parties which are acting in the
same capacity). However, this should not affect its validity vis a vis other
counterparties and, in particular, will not affect the enforceability of the
netting provisions under the individual master agreements. Mutuality is not
required (outside a winding up) where the set-off is based on contract. The
fact that a counterparty is in administration would not prevent the set-off
from being upheld, whether as regards that counterparty or any of the
others.

I have obviously just focussed on English law. One point I note, however, is
that Section 2(c) states that any automatic termination provision in the
underlying master agreements is inapplicable. This is not a concern as a
matter of English law because automatic early termination is not required
for the netting arrangements to be enforceable. However, the position is
different in certain other jurisdictions (Germany, for example). The risk is
that this provision will affect the underlying netting arrangements as
regards counterparties incorporated in those jurisdictions.

As Paul pointed out yesterday, the fact that the multilateral netting
arrangements would not be enforceable on an insolvency means that you cannot
regard them as creating a net position for regulatory capital purposes
(although this does not affect the recognition of the netting under each
underlying agreement).

I hope this is helpful. If you would like detailed points on the agreement,
please let me know.

"RE: VMAC Transaction","I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

Subject:	VMAC Transaction 

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Attention:  Kathy Moore

Kathy, thanks for your help.

The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
Cinergy and PJM West.

We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
(at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.

As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
retail customers.

By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
December 3rd.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Thanks again for your help.

"Suggested revisions to EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment text","After discussions with Elizabeth Sager and Leslie Hansen, we have developed a few additions to the EOL Paperless Confirm Amendment form to clarify that (1) neither party shall (not just that neither party is required to) send paper confirms, and (2) the transaction's records on EOL control over any conflicting terms in the underlying Governing Agreement. I have attached a draft below of a Consent and Agreement for Idacorp with the proposed changes in italics (see Para. 1(a)(i) and 3). We made this last change in anticipation of revised EOL power product definitions, which new definitions will conflict with important terms (such as the force majeure clause) in the Power Master.  If you don't want any of these proposed changes to be made to the form as a whole, and would prefer that they be handled in the Power Annex so as to apply only to Power, please let me know.

"RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap - Tax"," 

Hi Susan,

Attachment shows the changes from the WTI product description.  Only difference is currency and product description contains methodology for doing this conversion.  Stefan is confirming with Houston that the methodology will work.

I suspect that in terms of marketing the new products, there will be lots of flexibility (Stefan is this right?)  Accordingly, perhaps if you can tell them what they can and cant do to stay safe, this might be enough.

Thanks.

Jane

Stefan,

Sorry I didn't respond sooner; it's been really hectic around here.

The GTC looks fine; it's the standard GTC for ENA financial products.

The product descriptions generally look fine as well.  One question I have, however, is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ (apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY) from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA?

Also, the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that: 

""the products are part of Enron Japan's overall effort to extend Enron's crude and products business to Japan.  It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements.""  

Pursuant to our previous discussions and e-mails, I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products.  If this is not the case, we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product (e.g., such as marketing).  Please confirm what the facts are going to be (as they currently stand).

Best regards,
Susan

Below are the documents Jane sent to Legal HOU for approval. 
As you see we intent to be live by Thursday. We hope to have the documents in the system later today (Wed. your time). Could you take a look at the documents and let Jane/me know if you see any issues in signing off on the product? We might want to ask you for sign-off by tomorrow.

Subject:	RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap 
Importance:	High

Dear Frank,

Many thanks for helping out on this.  Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  

There has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.

I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  

Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me).

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.

Re the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. 

I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to ""foreign"" products, we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.

Re Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

These are created by legal counsel in the jurisdiction of the Enron entity. So for example if this was for Enron Australia David Minns would be creating the GTC. It appears from your email however that the Enron entity will be ENA hence I would assume that ENA legal counsel would want control over the GTC in this case but obviously you need to clarify.

I work for the EnronOnline Product Control Group which basically administers and co-ordinates the EOL website.

By the way how were these created and who normally creates these; also what is your role in all this?

Hi Alan (and Susan),

As you may know, Enron Japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto EOL in an effort to try and pry the Japanese market open a little bit faster.  Although this is an Enron Japan initiative, the Enron CP would be ENA, so the governing law should probably not be Japanese (but this is unclear - there is a thought that Japanese CPs may prefer Japanese law, but it is also arguable whether they would know or care - in any case Susan, any tax issues in having ENA doing yen denominated trades over EOL under Japanese law?

Anyway the main reason for the email is that I have some very boring questions.  Alan, I am not sure (and to be honest have never really been able to figure out) who makes global EOL legal decisions, whether they come out of London or Houston (because seems to be some overlap) - but since the CP would be ENA, Houston legal will have to be involved, so perhaps Mark Taylor, but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person.

1.	Procedure wise - who should draft the GTCs for this new product?
2.	If they are done under a US law - who gives legal sign off? 
3.	If they are done under Japanese law - can I sign off? Very happy to do so but not having any EOL experience I would need to work closely with someone from EOL legal who could confirm that other than any issues of Japanese law, they are consistent with what we want from the EOL GTCs generally.
4.	Who signs off on ""product descriptions"" - what is the formal process - I assume it includes the commercial person - in this case Stefan Niesler, does it also require someone from legal, do I do this as the EJ lawyer - should l also get the ENA lawyer to approve since the CP is ENA.

Sorry if these questions seem trivial but I don't know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing what.

Thanks very much.

Kind regards.

Sorry I missed your call yesterday.  The answer to the question you left on your phone message (i.e., whether there are any tax issues given the current description and facts relating to the WTI product) is no, there shouldn't be any tax issues under the structure described below.

Are you going to revise the description for the product that is currently on EnronOnline Datamanager?  (It currently has the old description where Enron Japan Corp. was going to enter into these transactions.)

Susan,

I hope I didn't confuse you too much yesterday night. 
Here is a quick run down on how we think the Japanese Yen nominated WTI Swap could work:

The mechanics remain the same. The US WTI Swap quotes are converted in Yen/KL and posted on EOL. Incoming transaction are hedged out against the US WTI Swap and the FX exposure is hedge out manually. 

The Enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ENA. (same as for the US WTI Swap). The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA. (That's nothing new, they already do that.) 

Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development. First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution. ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books. (No EJ books as touched in this transactions). 
The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate. We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market. It is supporting our overall market penetration effort. 
The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group. Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don't see as material. The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with non-Japanese counterparties. In addition, the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJ's from a Japanese point of view. 

I hope this helps to clarify some things. Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information.

Thank you!

Regards,
StN

This is a long one - but definitely worth reading. 



Cover title: Enron's Cutthroat Culture

How Enron Blew It 
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz < <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>> 
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me.""

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started.

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 

You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.

""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.

""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions

NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax

returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to

Chris,

The current text in Section 7 of the Firm GTC for the CAN Gas Phy Index Firm East products should be deleted and replaced with the following text:

(a)	Seller shall be liable for and shall pay, or cause to be paid, or reimburse Buyer, if Buyer has paid, all Taxes applicable to the Product sold hereunder upstream of the Delivery Point(s).  If Buyer is required to remit such Tax, the amount thereof shall be deducted from any sums becoming due to Seller hereunder.  Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay, cause to be paid, or reimburse Seller, if Seller has paid, all Taxes applicable to the sale and/or delivery of Product hereunder at and downstream of the Delivery Point(s) including any Taxes imposed or collected by a taxing authority with jurisdiction over Buyer; provided, however, when laws, ordinances or regulations permit or impose upon Seller the obligation to collect or pay Taxes applicable to the sale and/or delivery of Product hereunder at the Delivery Point, Seller shall collect all such Taxes from Buyer, which shall be in addition to the Contract Price, and remit the same to the appropriate governmental authority. Seller or Buyer shall indemnify, defend, and hold the other Party harmless from and against any liability with respect to Taxes for which the Seller or Buyer, as applicable, is liable hereunder.  Either Party, upon written request of the other, shall provide a certificate of exemption or other reasonably satisfactory evidence of exemption if either Party is exempt from taxes, and shall use reasonable efforts to obtain and cooperate with obtaining any exemption from or reduction of any Tax.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) a Buyer purchasing the Commodity for delivery in any of the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario or Quebec must provide to the Seller a completed exemption certificate or drop-shipment certificate, as appropriate, i.e., a B.C. Certificate of Exemption, Ontario Purchase Exemption Certificate or Quebec Drop-Shipment Certificate; and (ii) a Party is not liable for any applicable Taxes that are legally imposed on the other Party and that are refundable to the other Party, including without limitation the Canadian Goods and Services Tax.  ""Taxes"" means any or all ad valorem, goods and services, property, occupation, gross receipts, privilege, sales, use, consumption, excise, lease, transaction, and other taxes, governmental charges, licenses, fees, permits and assessments, or increase therein, other than taxes based on net income or net worth.  

(b)	If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and Buyer would be responsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 7(a), and such New Tax is of the type which Buyer can pass directly through to, or be reimbursed by, a Person other than Seller, Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid (or reimburse Seller if Seller has paid) all such New Taxes and Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller from any claims for such Taxes.  If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and Seller would otherwise be responsible for such New Tax if it were a Tax under Section 7(a), and such New Tax is of the type which Seller can pass directly through to, or be reimbursed by, a Person other than Buyer, Seller shall pay or cause to be paid (or reimburse Buyer if Buyer has paid) all such New Taxes and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Buyer from any claims for such Taxes.  If a New Tax occurs that affects a Transaction, and the provisions of this Section 7(b) do not otherwise apply, the Party affected by the New Tax shall notify the Party not affected of such New Tax.  The Parties shall attempt to reach mutual agreement as to sharing of the New Tax.  If the Parties are unable to reach mutual agreement within 5 business days, the Parties shall submit to binding arbitration, in accordance with the terms set forth in Section 10 of this Agreement, to determine each Party's respective liability for the New Tax.  ""New Taxes"" means Taxes enacted and effective after the Effective Date, including any change in the law, rule or regulation or interpretation thereof relating to Taxes.  ""New Taxes"" shall not include any increase in the rate of Taxes, including increases in the rate of sales and use taxes, goods and services taxes, value added taxes, or taxes imposed generally on net income or profits.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments, or need additional information.

Best regards,
Susan

"RE: Follow-up Materials"," 

Michael - the above Q&A document for the EPA discusses the compliance supplement pool questions you raise.  The document is dated - so the dates are no longer accurate given the court delays of the SIP Call implementation.  But basically, it is up to each state to develop a methodology for allocating their compliance supplement pool.  The CSP is meant to give credits to units that make early reductions.  The compliance supplement pool (roughly 200,000 allowances for the NOx SIP Call) is only good for the first two years of a state's launch of its NOx SIP Call.  Those allowances that aren't allocated during these first two years are retired.

Ok.  The file you sent me contains the total trading budget and CSP.  The states total allowances equal the total trading budget and the CSP?  Is the CSP a one time allocation in SIP CALL while total trading budget is annually?  If CSP is only a one time allocation, have the states determined how many allowances from the CSP will be used in 04? 05? etc.  Or is there some other method that I am missing?

On the state file.  The CSP of each state added together is way above 25,000.  Why is this?  How should I look at this CSP?  Is there a discount factor that will be applied to get down to the 25,000 at the end of 2002.  If so, what is it?

Should I add them all together and get a percent per state?  And then multiply the percent by 25,000 to determine the state's CSP at the end of 2002?  Please advise.

Michael - I haven't heard back from Joel yet on a call date & time, but here is some of the info I promised.  Attached is the latest information I have on the state allocations, including their total trading budgets:

 << File: State.htm >> 


Also attached, is the Section 126 Non-EGU allocations:

 << File: Sec. 126 NonEGU affected units.pdf >> 

I am pretty sure this is all the non-EGUs that will affected in those states under the SIP Call, but am double checking just to be completely sure.

I am still working on a date that the allowances have to be parked in the compliance supplement pool in 2002 to be valid in 2003.  

I'll let you know as soon as I have some more answers.

The last change in the Annex is still being finalized but I included it so you could review the language/concept.

Regards,
Brent

As you requested  attached is language EPMI/ENA currently uses for index based power deals at various delivery points.  This language forms the basis for what is inserted into physical and financial confirmations for power index-based deals.  The underlying confirmations may also contain conforming language depending upon the delivery point and the counterparty.  This language is updated/revised periodically as indexes change, new information becomes available and/or to fit the agreed upon transaction.  If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 6349.

Elizabeth,

I have attached the index language we are currently using in confirmation letters.

 

The Megawatt Daily Index language in the above attachment is used for Cinergy and Comed (the delivery points are not listed in the example).

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Melissa

"RE: Chiricahua Assignments","Attached is a redraft of the assignment agreements based on comments from Bret and Mark Taylor.  Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Subject:	Chiricahua Assignments

I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need to assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These two entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intended that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions directly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a term that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is that some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chiricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December and the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the process to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal in broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process please call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement, legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspective.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA trades to Chiricahua III and V entities.  

 << File: ChiricahauIIIAssignment11-19-01.doc >>  << File: ChiricahauVAssignment11-19-01.doc >> 

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be entered into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These are based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be delivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolutions passed?

 << File: ChiricahuaIII042Cctr(xl trading).doc >>  << File: ChiricahuaV042Cctr(xl trading).doc >> 

I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into between the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or the document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the document by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Chiricahua III

 << File: XL Trading_W10423.1.doc >>  << File: Xl Trading_W10492.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10522.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10531.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10543.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10544.1.doc >> 

Chiricahua V

 << File: XL Trading_W10545.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10548.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10549.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10552.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10553.1.doc >>  << File: XL Trading_W10555.1.doc >> 

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentation.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or process of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.

Regards,
Brent

To:	Woods, Trevor; Massey II, John
Cc:	Mcclellan, George; Middleton, Vince
Subject:	TVA Peaker Proposal

Attached is the draft proposal for the TVA peakers.  Please have a look and provide any comments.

Please confirm the bid prices you provided earlier and I used for the option pricing:

2004 to 2007 average NOx price = $3000/ton
2008 = $1000/ton

Also, please provide an idea of the value to the desk of this transaction (i.e. bid to offer spread), so that I can properly quantify the value of the transaction to Enron in my discussions with George. (Each unit provides about 600 tons per season,there are 8 units and we have a call option for 5 years starting in 2004).


Thanks

Re:	Response to your remarks of 7 September.


Dear Schuyler,

I would like respond to your mail concerning the ISDA Protocol.

Concerning Annex 3:-

I concur with your observations that in many lending and repo master
agreements there are events of default that are of another nature than
the events which are Events of Default under the ISDA.  These events
include, for example, being suspended from an exchange (which may be
relevant as an event of default with respect to securities in a specific
market, but was very likely not foreseen by the parties to the ISDA as
an Event of Default under the broader product coverage of the ISDA).

In addition, in the proposed ?5(a)(v)(2) there is a similar cross
pollution issue with respect to delivery failures.  When reviewing the
many master agreements where under physical delivery of shares or bonds
are foreseen there is little consistency with respect to the treatment
of delivery failures.  ISDA documented products have the possibility to
be covered by Failure to Deliver provisions, some agreements provide for
a mini-default/close-out, some try to bring in a cash element as a test
for proving a counterparty's liquidity (often a termination event
approach) ,  and others offer the option of a mini-close-out or a total
default, and yet other documents offer only a total default.  Given the
regularity these failures occur in the market,  I have drafted a version
of Annex 3, which also addresses this issue by building into the
provisions a procedure (a shortened version of the Failure to Deliver
provision used in ISDA's 1997 Government Bond Option Definitions)
whereby the counterparty is given the opportunity to prove its
liquidity.  I attach the annex I have prepared addressing these issues.

Annex 8:-

Concerning Early Termination Date and Section 6, you raise very
interesting issues, which I confess I had not focused on before in that
light.  I agree with your analysis that with the effective date of the
notice being the true termination date of the Transactions with the
Early Termination Date being more a valuation date.  My view is that
this is an opportune time to discuss the issues you raise in more detail
given the broad scope of the up coming Master Agreement Protocol.

I attach the alternative proposal for Annex 3.  Would you please forward
this response to the broader documentation committee, as I am unable to
do so from my computer because I did not receive the original e-mail due
to the length of the header on the e-mail.

Regards,

Joseph Carrico

"Any ideas??","Hello:


I am working with  a group of lawyers organized by the Bar Association of
the City of New York to help identify emergency funding sources for small
businesses affected by the World Trade Center attack.  The idea is to help
them secure short term loans and/or grants so that they can stay in business
during this difficult period.  I am able to investigate the various sources
of government funding (SBA, FEMA)  but need your help with finding sources
of private money such as foundations, corporate funds, the September 11th
Fund (?).

My goal is to compile a list of available resources for use during
counseling sessions with business owners.  There are teams of other lawyers
from various firms who have agreed to represent small business owners, on a
pro bono basis, in their effort to complete  paperwork and deal with a
staggering array of other legal matters including insurance, tax, real
estate, employment and immigration issues.

You all share the dubious distinction of being in my rolodex and being
perceived (by me at least) as having the right kind of contacts to help me
find people and organizations to call.  My thought is that you or your
colleagues and friends may be affiliated with a foundation, firm or
corporation that has somehow raised money or made money available for this
purpose.  Feel free to call me with information at 646-428-1814 or email me.
Also feel free to pass this message on to any others who could help.

Thanks, Bill McGovern.

"UK:   Enron ups online metals transaction sizes.","FYI.  Good idea.  But, I think we may have some exposure to manage if there are follow-up articles.  If the 200 lot product is not offered universally to all EOL customers, it's a change from the way we have positioned EnronOnline.  There may a legal issue with it as well.  It will be helpful for me to know how offering the product selectively benefits Enron.

UK:
Enron ups online metals transaction sizes.

09/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Commodities trader Enron has amended its internet
trading platform EnronOnline (www.enrononline.com) to allow some users to
increase the size of metals transactions.

For selected clients, Enron is now making markets in three months copper and
aluminium for maximum 200-lot transactions, compared with the standard 20-lot
markets on the system.
For the larger-volume deals Enron is quoting a wider $4 bid-ask spread rather
than the standard $2 spread.

Joe Gold, president of Enron Metals, said, ""The 200-lot market was developed
because a number of people asked us to put something of a larger size on
there.""

He said the 200-lot market was open to a restricted number of users, but was
not focused on any one particular section of the market.

""People who like large lots tend to be big producers, some of the funds, and
so on. They're people who have a commercial relationship with us already,"" he
said.

Traders said the increased transaction size could give Enron an added edge
when competing for fund business.

""It's a big step up in liquidity. If I was them my first call would be to the
top 10 fund managers to say 'why don't you stop messing around with phone
calls and come to the screen where you can trade 200 lots at the click of a
button?'"" said one.

""Even if they don't manage to get these guys' business, they've raised the
bar. Their other clients may have to conform to the Enron model, offering
200-lot deals and maybe a $3 spread if they want to beat Enron.""

U.S.-based Enron Corp became a major player in the metals trade in May last
year when it acquired MG plc, a leading independent international metals
dealing firm in London which had previously absorbed fellow LME ring-dealers
Rudolf Wolff & Co and Billiton Metals Ltd.

In July last year the company announced the first physical metals transaction
on EnronOnline.

The system differs from the screen trading systems operated by the London
Metal Exchange (LME) and UK-based metals and energy broker Spectron in that
the trading platform is open to a broad range of users but Enron is the sole
counter-party in each transaction.

Both the LME's LME Select and the Spectron trading platform enable trading
between individual users, but limit membership to Category 1 (ring dealing)
and Category 2 (associate broker clearing) members of the LME.

CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION

Brian/Craig -

I spoke to Helaine Fine of Risk Metrics.  She indicated that RM is looking at the min. license fee number of $96K as the value to reimburse RM for the development costs of the CreditStream product.  I pointed out that we would be entitled to the $4800 revenue share from the one subscriber (as we discussed). She acknowledged that this was provided for under the agreement and realized that we had not provided for any consideration if RM had to reimburse all subscription fees to subscribers.  I also pointed out that we had no use for the CreditStream name and trademark application and no real value associated with it either, but that we would be willing to assign this to RM if they saw any use or value.  My thought on that is to simply recoup our legal costs in pursuing the application to this point - probably around $1,500 to $2,000.

Helaine was going to speak to Alan about all of the above and get back to me.  No mention was made of the Credit Manager product and I believe we should leave it that way for now. 

I'll keep you updated.

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

"CommodityLogic","Mark -

I received your message and agree that this is probably a better way to communicate.

I spoke to Tom this morning. There is an industry hub meeting next week - with limited attendance.  While continuing to promote the neutrality of the CL hub, Tom would also like to move this industry issue forward by possibly promoting the sale of interests in the CL hub.  I asked whether or not the hub can be separated from the base CL product (e.g., the general infrastructure and individual modules) and Tom responded that it is quite possible to separate the hub (and its support mechanisms - including the data base information) from the CL product.  I suggested that we may want to consider separating the hub from the product (by formation of a different legal entity), but would imagine that we would need tax and other approvals.

Tom would like assistance in the following areas: 

1.  General overview of the antitrust arena he would be dealing in.  I provided this consistent with my current understanding of antitrust matters in the e-commerce world (as confirmed by Ken Reisler at SC by previous discussions)

2.  General overview of the vehicles that could be used to form the hub organization (e.g., profit vs. non-profit companies, LLC's vs. other corporate forms, alliance/joint ventures).  While I have some background in a lot of these type of organizations, I do not have any experience with non-profit entities.  Should I get someone at V&E or Sullivan & Cromwell to assist or is there anyone internal you could suggest?  V&E may be a better choice here only because of the probability that all potential owners are located in Houston.

3.  General issues relating to confidentiality of discussions between potential hub owners.  While there is currently an NDA in place with a number of companies in relation to these discussions, Tom really sees only a handful being serious players.  Accordingly, it is possible Tom may want to spearhead conversations with only those few and possible move a project forward on a faster track.  The questions that have been raised are in relation to the manner in which these discussions should take place and how (if at all) they should be documented.  While I suggested that they should be under a secondary NDA and probably based upon some form of LOI or other intention memorandum, I believe we should get a clear indication of how to move forward so that we can ensure confidentiality, neutrality and avoidance of any future claims or concerns (e.g., antitrust concerns).  Is V&E the choice here also or should we talk to Sullivan personnel?

Tom will need some of this information for his meeting on Thursday.  Since I will be out of the office on Tuesday and Wednesday next week, I wanted to get the ball rolling this week.

Thanks.

Mark

"Re: Did you make it back?","I was so lucky.  I took the 10:00 train from paddington (which by the way is fabulous) and got to the terminal at 10:10.  Security guards were making everyone leave the terminal unless their flight left before noon - the rule was that you could not come into the terminal until 2 hours before flight time ( this is of course different than the Virgin Atlantic pre recorded message which said to get to the airport 3 hours early).  Everyone was being herded outside the terminal - for security reasons they didn't want so many people in the terminal.  People were sitting on their suitcases in  a grassy area and someone said buses were moving people to offsite loacations to wait.

 I asked the Virgin rep and she said that only the people holding tkts with a 9/16th flight date were allowed to line up to check in and everyone else had to go to a separate stand by line  - and by the way this line stretched around the world.  They were massively overbooked and she said only the ticketed passengers would get on.

I just happened to be standing next to a guy who also had a tkt on Continental/Virgin for the same flight - he said that he had talked to Continental in the US and they told him to go first to the continental counter and get reticketed.  So he and I went to t he Continental counter ( where they were giving out cookies!) and got reticketed for the 16th.  I never would have known to go to the countinental counter if I hadn't talked to him.  By then it was about 11:30 - so we sneaked back into the Virgin Atlantic line and and hour later we were processed in.

It was just too lucky.  I felt awful though - some of the people in the standby line were crying - they looked just desperate to get to the US.

We waited on the ground for 2 hours and then left the gate at about 4.  Every seat was taken and it was a miserably uncomfortable flight.

But here I am.

After a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security
-- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in Houston.
I talked to Amanda after I checked in and she said you were on the train
to the airport.  Did you have any trouble?

"RE: FW: ENE/ENA Change of Ownership Diligence Inquiry","The 11/1 e-mail (excerpt below) also notes that no event of default otherwise would occur, a fact specific inquiry; e.g., debt to cap ratio upon consummation of the merger:

Typical merger provisions provide that either (i) ENE survive or if not, (ii) 
the survivor be organized under U.S. (or state thereof) law, 
assume all obligations of ENE under the subject contract, and 
no event of default under the subject agreement would exist or result (whether an event of default would exist requires facts on a specific deal so covenants and other contract terms can be tested). 

To the extent that other groups reported to me differences from the typical provisions set forth above, I forwarded them onto to you.

In rereading your email from 11/1/01, whether Enron is the survivor of the merger makes no difference, as long as, if it's not the survivor, the survivor assumes the obligations.  Nothing seems to be triggered in the provisions described, as long as (1) the survivor has equal or better or investment-grade credit, which we assume will be the case, (2) the deal is done with approval of the Enron board, which has occurred, and (3) Enron survives or the survivor assumes, which would be case if we switch to a structure in which Enron does not survive.

Does any of the recipients disagree?

Hi Susan,

Attachment shows the changes from the WTI product description.  Only difference is currency and product description contains methodology for doing this conversion.  Stefan is confirming with Houston that the methodology will work.

I suspect that in terms of marketing the new products, there will be lots of flexibility (Stefan is this right?)  Accordingly, perhaps if you can tell them what they can and cant do to stay safe, this might be enough.

Thanks.

Jane

Stefan,

Sorry I didn't respond sooner; it's been really hectic around here.

The GTC looks fine; it's the standard GTC for ENA financial products.

The product descriptions generally look fine as well.  One question I have, however, is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ (apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY) from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA?

Also, the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that: 

""the products are part of Enron Japan's overall effort to extend Enron's crude and products business to Japan.  It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements.""  

Pursuant to our previous discussions and e-mails, I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products.  If this is not the case, we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product (e.g., such as marketing).  Please confirm what the facts are going to be (as they currently stand).

Best regards,
Susan

Subject:	RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap 
Importance:	High

Dear Frank,

Many thanks for helping out on this.  Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  

There has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.

I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  

Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me).

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.

Re the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. 

I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to ""foreign"" products, we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.

Re Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.

As just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this. But, I do want to warn you that everyone here, including Frank, is engaged in a number of high priority projects related to, among other things, entering into master netting agreements and the like to manage the credit issues affecting the Company. Accordingly, the timetable for a reply may not be in line with your expectations.

Jane, I noted that the draft of the GTCs had a glitch in the Business Day definition. You should resend to Frank.

Subject:	EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap 

Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

*********************

Please leave me a message or send me an email if you want me to call you Monday evening your time.

"confirmation templates","Mark:

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all ""legally approved"" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

Craig,
 
As we  discussed on Thursday, LG&E is preparing to enter into a hedge plan.
 
LG&E's hedge  plan is based on the use of call options.  The Public Service  Commission is expected to act on that proposal in the next few  days.
 
Chris Balmer, Pam  Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LG&E's  hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you  may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters.  We believe it  will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at  this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the  program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn  around times.
 
Attached are two  documents which will be the basis of that discussion.  The first is a draft  Bid Letter and the second is the General Terms and Conditions under which the  call options will be purchased.
 
Please review the  attachment and pass them along to whomever may need to be involved at your  company.
 
Thanks
 
Clay

"Contract Settlement - Required Approvals","Lance -

It is my understanding that Enron Credit is currently closing down operations.  In light of this, EC has a contractual obligation to a company called Risk Metrics Group.  The obligation arises out of the development and hosting by RMG of a website devoted to the use of EC's credit risk data - the site being mainly focused toward subscribers to other RMG products.  Since we are terminating the development and hosting agreement - in essence shutting down the site - we will owe RMG approximately $96,000.

While I realize this is a small sum, I wanted to make sure (1) there are no approvals under the merger agreement that are required for a settlement of this nature and (2) if we are tracking this type of liability for merger purposes, that I provide the necessary information to the appropriate personnel.

Please let me know if either of the above are necessary.

Thanks.

"(01-410) NEW TEMPORARY NYMEX RULE: EXCHANGE OF OTC ENERGY OPTIONS	 FOR NYMEX ENERGY OPTIONS","November 30, 2001
Notice No. 01-410

TO:		NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
		NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS

FROM:		J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

SUBJECT:	NEW TEMPORARY NYMEX RULE: EXCHANGE OF OTC ENERGY OPTIONS FOR
NYMEX ENERGY OPTIONS
____________________________________________________________________________
_____

Yesterday, the Exchange distributed Notice to Members No. 01-409, which
summarized a new temporary procedure going into effect today that permits
the exchange of OTC energy options for NYMEX energy options (EOO).  As an
informational follow-up to yesterday's notice, this notice includes the text
of the new temporary EOO rule.

				NEW TEMPORARY NYMEX RULE 6.21E

Rule 6.21E.    EXCHANGE OF OTC ENERGY OPTIONS FOR, OR IN CONNECTION WITH
NYMEX ENERGY OPTIONS  (Temporary Rule)

(A) (1) An exchange of Exchange energy options for, or in connection with,
an over-the counter (""OTC"") energy options product (or an OTC product with
similar characteristics) (hereafter an exchange of options for options or
""EOO"") consists of two discrete, but related, transactions; an OTC options
transaction and an Exchange options transaction.  At the time such
transaction is effected, the buyer and seller of the Exchange options must
be, respectively, the seller and the buyer of the OTC options.  The OTC
options component shall involve the commodity underlying the related futures
contract to the Exchange options contract (or a derivative, by-product or
related product of such commodity).  The quantity covered by the OTC options
must be approximately equivalent to the quantity covered by the Exchange
options contracts. This temporary rule shall terminate thirty (30) days
following the effective date of the implementation of the rule.

	(2) Restriction on Eligible Contracts.  EOO transactions may be
effected for transactions in any of the Exchange's energy options contracts.

	(3) Restriction on Transactions.  An EOO that establishes a NYMEX
options position for both buyer and seller shall not be permitted on the
first business day following the expired NYMEX contract.

		(B)(1)  The report of an EOO transaction shall be given on
the Floor of the Exchange during the hours of futures trading.  (2) EOO
transactions are permitted until trading terminates on the last day of
trading in the applicable expiring options contract month.

C)  A report of such EOO transaction shall be submitted to the Exchange by
each Clearing Member representing the buyer and/or seller.  Such report
shall identify the EOO as made under this Rule and shall contain the
following information: a statement that the OTC options component of the EOO
complied with any applicable CFTC regulatory requirements at the time the
EOO was entered into between the buyer and seller, a statement that the EOO
has resulted or will result in a change of payments or other such change,
the kind and quantity of the options, the price at which the options
transaction is to be cleared, the names of the Clearing Members and
customers and such other information as the Exchange may require.  Such
report (form) shall be submitted to the Compliance Department by 12:00 noon,
no later than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the
EOO on the Floor of the Exchange.

(D)(1) Each buyer and seller must satisfy the Exchange, at its request, that
the transaction is a legitimate EOO transaction.  Upon the request of the
Exchange, all documentary evidence relating to the EOO, including relevant
OTC documentation, shall be obtained by the Clearing Members from the buyer
or seller and made available by the Clearing Members for examination by the
Exchange.  Additionally, if the buyer or seller is a Member/Member Firm, the
Exchange may obtain the information directly from such person(s).

(2) No EOO that is linked to or contingent upon entry into a second,
offsetting OTC options transaction may be transacted at any time.

(3)	Failure by a buyer or seller, or its Clearing Member to satisfy the
Exchange that an EOO transaction is bona fide shall subject such buyer or
seller, if a Member/Member Firm, or the Clearing Member to disciplinary
action.  Such disciplinary action, depending on the gravity of the offense,
may be deemed to be a major offense of the Exchange's rules.  Further, if
the buyer or seller is not a Member/Member Firm, the Exchange may conduct a
hearing before the Business Conduct Committee to limit, condition or deny
access to the market.

(E) Each EOO transaction shall be posted by the Floor Members and cleared
through the Exchange in accordance with normal procedures and by the
Clearing Members involved.

(F)  All omnibus accounts and foreign brokers shall submit a signed EOO
reporting agreement in the form prescribed by the Exchange to the Exchange?s
Compliance Department.  Such Agreement shall provide that any omnibus
account or foreign broker identified by a Clearing Member (or another
omnibus account or foreign broker) as the buyer or seller of an EOO pursuant
to Rule 6.21A(C), shall supply the name of its customer and such other
information as the Exchange may require.  Such information shall be
submitted to the Exchange?s Compliance Department by 12:00 noon no later
than two (2) Exchange business days after the day of posting the EOO on the
Floor of the Exchange.  Failure by an omnibus account or foreign broker to
submit either the agreement or the particular EOO information to the
Exchange may result in a hearing by the Business Conduct Committee to limit,
condition or deny access of such omnibus account or foreign broker to the
market.

The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.

If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

Thanks, 
KC

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Mark,

 Sara, Alan and I met this afternoon to discuss fallback pricing in the energy markets scenario....Sara had sat in on a morning telephone conference with a large number of the large institutional traders...John Nolan and John Wilson were the Enron reps on the call.  Sara noted that she thought there was a subsequent call with basically the same group, but that she did not attend.....we called John Wilson to see if there had been a subsequent meeting....he confirmed that there had been and that he had participated.. 

There appeared to be consensus as how to treat the failure of Platt to publish for the last 2 days. Since many oil traders use the Platt's index and since the oil contracts generally use a monthly average price, the consensus was to delete those days for which Platt did not publish and thus, have fewer days in the monthly average. The Enron oil traders have relatively insignificant contracts to which this index applies, and John Wilson was comfortable with this approach, and was planning to check with one additional trader and get back to Sara for final commercial sign off.

On the spreads between Brent products and TI products, it is common in the industry to only use dates in which both are being traded  (i.e. not July 4 and not the funky Brit banking holidays in August). This is referred to as ""common pricing"".  There was general consensus that in calculating prices for these spreads, the days where no U.S. prices were published would be treated as Non-common days and thus ignored in the calculation.  John says that Enron' s portfolio of these types of transaction is extremely small and thus, this acceptable to Enron.

On the"" Exchange-priced products"", the consensus was to use the prices published for first trading day that the Exchange reopens and  trades as the surrogate price for each day in the month that had no Exchange price reported....thus, using a full month in the calculations of monthly average prices.  As you know the vast majority of our natural gas contracts refer to the last three days of the NYMEX trading or the final day. Thus, again Enron's exposure would be relatively low so long as the exchange opens before these critical dates.

The forwarded document indicates that NYMEX is apparently planning to do this as well; however, it could be written more clearly.


Lastly, at the conclusion of our t con with John Wilson we were told by him that the new general counsel of IDA held a conference call today.Unfortunately no one in the legal department was aware of the call so as to participate. Sara agreed that she would call her tomorrow to see what occurred.

Best regards bng

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

Subject:	RE: Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap

Jane, happy to  work through this with you. In essence there are 2 steps -
 
Firstly there is approving the GTCs and the product description. As Justin said this done by the relevant lawyer for the  jurisdiction or more particularly the  Enron counterparty. If the decision is to use US law the counterparty would be ENA. In this case an EWS lawyer in Houston would give the signoff to both the GTCs and the product description. (The two are handled together). Conversely if  Japanese law is chosen then the Enron counterparty that would do an OTC trade for that product in Japan would be the counterparty. That I assume would be EJ. Which choice of law and counterparty to use?  It has been the practice to follow the currency. For example in understand  ENA offers  Japanese and Australian weather in USD. There is also a final legal signoff given by Mark Taylor. This is generally a formality as Mark would be primarily concerned that  relevant lawyer has given their OK.

Secondly, each counterparty needs to be approved to trade the product. This is done by the lawyer responsible for the product (ie the one that approved the GTCs) as well as the lawyer where the company is incorporated/resident. Hence I would assume you would be approving Japanese counterparties irrespective of whether EJ or ENA is the counterparty.

Give me call

These are created by legal counsel in the jurisdiction of the Enron entity. So for example if this was for Enron Australia David Minns would be creating the GTC. It appears from your email however that the Enron entity will be ENA hence I would assume that ENA legal counsel would want control over the GTC in this case but obviously you need to clarify.

I work for the EnronOnline Product Control Group which basically administers and co-ordinates the EOL website.

Subject:	Enron Japan - EOL - Yen denominated WTI swap


Hi Alan (and Susan),

As you may know, Enron Japan is trying to get some yen denominated products onto EOL in an effort to try and pry the Japanese market open a little bit faster.  Although this is an Enron Japan initiative, the Enron CP would be ENA, so the governing law should probably not be Japanese (but this is unclear - there is a thought that Japanese CPs may prefer Japanese law, but it is also arguable whether they would know or care - in any case Susan, any tax issues in having ENA doing yen denominated trades over EOL under Japanese law?

Anyway the main reason for the email is that I have some very boring questions.  Alan, I am not sure (and to be honest have never really been able to figure out) who makes global EOL legal decisions, whether they come out of London or Houston (because seems to be some overlap) - but since the CP would be ENA, Houston legal will have to be involved, so perhaps Mark Taylor, but would you mind forwarding my questions to the right person.

1.	Procedure wise - who should draft the GTCs for this new product?
2.	If they are done under a US law - who gives legal sign off? 
3.	If they are done under Japanese law - can I sign off? Very happy to do so but not having any EOL experience I would need to work closely with someone from EOL legal who could confirm that other than any issues of Japanese law, they are consistent with what we want from the EOL GTCs generally.
4.	Who signs off on ""product descriptions"" - what is the formal process - I assume it includes the commercial person - in this case Stefan Niesler, does it also require someone from legal, do I do this as the EJ lawyer - should l also get the ENA lawyer to approve since the CP is ENA.

Sorry if these questions seem trivial but I don't know my way on this at all and am concerned that things may fall through the cracks unless we know who will take responsibility for doing what.

Thanks very much.

Kind regards.

Sorry I missed your call yesterday.  The answer to the question you left on your phone message (i.e., whether there are any tax issues given the current description and facts relating to the WTI product) is no, there shouldn't be any tax issues under the structure described below.

Are you going to revise the description for the product that is currently on EnronOnline Datamanager?  (It currently has the old description where Enron Japan Corp. was going to enter into these transactions.)

Subject:	yen nominated WTI swap

Susan,

I hope I didn't confuse you too much yesterday night. 
Here is a quick run down on how we think the Japanese Yen nominated WTI Swap could work:

The mechanics remain the same. The US WTI Swap quotes are converted in Yen/KL and posted on EOL. Incoming transaction are hedged out against the US WTI Swap and the FX exposure is hedge out manually. 

The Enron entity entering into the initial transaction and all subsequent hedges is ENA. (same as for the US WTI Swap). The FX hedging will be done by people here in Tokyo who act as agents for ENA. (That's nothing new, they already do that.) 

Fair question remaining is what is the rational for the product for ENA and why are we involved in the product development. First of all we are looking for the easiest and most practical solution. ENA is interested because it extends the reach of an exiting product and provides additional deal flow through their books. (No EJ books as touched in this transactions). 
The rational for EJ is purely marketing relate. We underline our commitment to the market and proof ourselves as competitive and innovative suppliers of financial products for the Japanese Market. It is supporting our overall market penetration effort. 
The issue that it is not Enron Japan entering into the contract is secondary as the Japanese market is looking at Enron as a group. Possible customer concerns about contracting with a foreign company is something we don't see as material. The customer group we are targeting are international active companies that are used to dealings with non-Japanese counterparties. In addition, the credit rating of ENA is far better the EJ's from a Japanese point of view. 

I hope this helps to clarify some things. Please feel free to call me if I left anything out or if you need some additional information.

Thank you!

Sizable staff of 245 lawyers in merger limbo
By MARY FLOOD
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle

Whether troubled Enron Corp. merges, falls or stays the course, it is likely
to deeply affect one of Houston's largest law offices: the one within the
embattled company.

""We've always regarded them as one of the big law firms in Houston,"" said
Howard Ayers, managing partner of Andrews & Kurth, one of the city's largest
firms with about 240 lawyers in Houston alone.

Enron has about 245 lawyers worldwide, company spokesman Vance Meyer said.
That's a large legal stable even for a company with more than 25,000
employees. With about 145 lawyers in Houston, if it were a private firm it
would have been the city's sixth-largest, according to the Chronicle 100
survey released in May.

Energy trader Enron's internal law office has burgeoned along with the huge
trading firm, now set to merge with a smaller but stronger local competitor,
Dynegy. As Enron's stock plummeted further, Dynegy last week denied rumors
it might drop out and leave Enron to face a possible bankruptcy.

Whatever the company's fate, there are rough waters ahead for Enron lawyers.


Although most lawyers interviewed said they hope everybody remains employed
and that it is premature to discuss the fate of Enron's legal staff,
speculation in the legal community runs the gamut from rumors that dozens of
lawyers could be laid off as early as this week to the idea that Enron will
hold on tightly to its talent.

""My guess is they'll need their lawyers while they get things in a more
steady state. There's a lot of legal work to go through,"" said Joel Swanson,
a senior partner at Baker & Botts, a Houston law firm with about 265 lawyers
here.

Not only does Enron have a large cadre of lawyers inside its company, but it
also has hired just about every large firm in Houston over the last few
years. Several of the biggest Houston firms are working on the merger for
either Enron or Dynegy, and others are standing by wondering which outside
firms will get the biggest pieces of legal work when the new company is
created.

Enron's legal department has siphoned talent from Houston's top law firms
over the years. Heads of law firms said they have seen plenty of promising
lawyers lured away by Enron's competitive pay combined with stock options,
which were a lucrative draw until recently, as shares have lost 95 percent
of their value.

""Enron has one of the premier legal departments in the country,"" said Jeff
Love, managing partner of Locke Liddell & Sapp, a Houston-based firm with
about 175 of its lawyers here.

Enron has hired a lot of what are called ""laterals,"" or lawyers who have had
a couple years training, often at a big firm.

Although jobs in corporate counsel offices are generally considered easier
than big-firm life, that's not the reputation of Enron's legal eagles.

As with the company itself, the general counsel's office has been known as
innovative and hard driving.

""I don't think anybody lateraled into Enron with the expectation of an
ordinary life,"" Ayers said.

In the Houston market, where big-firm first-year lawyers start at around
$110,000 a year, the advantages of going to an expanding company like Enron
were the stock options and the opportunity to grow with the company.

If heavily anticipated layoffs occur at Enron, top Houston lawyers expect
casualties to land on their feet. Looming recessions are not always bad for
job-hunting lawyers. Bankruptcy, litigation and mergers all can boom in
rough times.

Several Houston-based law firms said they have recruited a slightly larger
starting class of lawyers for 2002, meaning they don't expect to scale back
their business in the immediate future.

Should the merger succeed, Enron's 245 lawyers will join Dynegy's 43.

""The question of how you integrate the two staffs, as with a lot of things
associated with the merger, won't be worked out for some time,"" Dynegy
spokesman Steve Stengel said.

"Project Notre Dame - Change in Control","The merger agreement with Dynegy provides that subs of Dynegy merger with Enron with Enron being the surviving corporation.  Enron and Dynegy then would be subs of a newly incorporated holding company.

It might be more advantageous for a variety of reasons to do a structure in which Enron mergers with the ultimate publicly traded company (whether existing Dynegy or a new holding company) with that publicly traded company being the nominal survivor.  Under Delaware, Oregon, and most other states' law, the surviving company automatically would assume all of Enron's obligations as a matter of law, and the merger agreement would so provide if this structure were used.

Could you review the various change-of-control provisions that you've previoulsy identified to see if this structure--with Enron not being the technical survivor of the merger--makes any difference to  your conclusions about whether those provisions would be triggered?  Please respond to Rob Walls, Lance Schuler, Joe Henry, Peter del Vecchio and me.  Thanks.

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be ""Not to be Confirmed.""  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to ""Not to be Confirmed.""  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.

Can we track down who/how these trades are getting entered into the system?  Is there someone entering the trades into the system?  Is this just an old counterparty/book set up in GCP that needs to get renamed.  Legal (me) has no idea why trades are being done out of EGM.  Can we find out who is doing them?

I think this refers to gas daily trades between Risk Management and Trade (which is an Enron entity set up for state tax reasons) and EGM (which may be a company code for Enron North America Corp. formerly known as Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.).  If this is the case, we should document them under the Master between ENA and RMT.  However, this is up to Legal.

There are about 20-30 deals in pending sent to legal status that are Riskmantra vs. EGM.  My question is should we even be doing trades with Enron Gas Marketing.  And if we should, can we set up an ISDA with RMT with an effective date of 9/5/01?

"FW: Entergy Koch","Kathryn -

Below are the annex and amendment for Cargill and (per Brent) the updated Entergy-Koch agreements.

These can be released to the customers, subject to the caveat that I had in my earlier e-mail messages.  My strong suggestion is to have both of these companies, if they have comments, to have them mark or note their comments and forward them to me.  I will work with Brent to address their comments.

I hope to have Williams to you tomorrow.

"RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language","Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name ""Houston Pipe Line Company"" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark ""HPL"".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty ""re-accept"" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other ""cleanup"" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to ""make it worth their while""..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either ""do nothing"" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the ""innocuous notice"" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the ""notification route"", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

"ISDA Cross Agreement Bridge and Commentary","Attached, please find the 2001 ISDA Cross-Agreement Bridge, blacklined
against the last version you received, dated July 26, 2001.  In addition,
please find a copy of the Commentary on the Bridge.

As many of you know, various working groups prepared amendments to the ISDA
Master Agreements to be effected through the use of a 2001 ISDA Master
Agreement Protocol.  In connection with this effort, the Structural Issues
Working Group prepared the Cross-Agreement Bridge.  Following meetings of
the Strategic Documentation Review Task Force in late July and discussions
in August and September, it was felt that the Protocol approach was too
complicated, from an operational and logistical perspective, given the
nature and the number of the proposed amendments.  Accordingly, it was
decided that the four euro annexes would be separated from the Protocol and
compiled in their own 2001 Euro Protocol.  The 2001 Euro Protocol is now
available on our website and the adherence period ends on November 30, 2001.
Annexes 1 to 9 of the Protocol have been prepared as a Form of Amendment to
the ISDA Master Agreements.  The Form of Amendment, and the Commentary, will
be published on ISDA's website late this week or early next week.  Work is
scheduled to begin on a new Master Agreement and kick-off meetings to
discuss the new draft Master Agreement will be held in London later this
year.  Details will be announced to the Documentation Committee soon.

As for the Bridge, it was felt that we should publish this on our website as
well.  Accordingly, I have attached the drafts for your review.  Please note
that the ""option to disapply"" was deleted in this draft, primarily because
the version of the Bridge considered by ISDA's netting counsel in late 2000
did not include such an option.

I would be grateful if you could review the attached documents by Friday,
November 2.  I would like to publish these on our website on Monday,
November 5.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at 212-332-1203 if you have any
questions. Thank you very much for your consideration.

Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-
 
1.  Novation Agreement

*	You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance in
NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax
*	As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*	To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*	See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.
*	This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*	Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.
 
 
Thanks and regards,

Subject:	EGM Legal Allocation

Deb, 
EGM is requesting a list of the attorneys that work on EGM cases.  Based on our allocation schedule (I have attached it again for your reference), the following cost center owners are allocating costs to EGM: Sanders, Taylor, Aronowitz, Cash.

Could you please give me a list of attorneys within these groups that work on EGM?  I realize that Aronowitz's group is 100% EGM, so a list of attorney's in that group would work.  I also realize that Michelle Cash is probably the one within her own group who would do any work for them.  In addition though, for Sanders and Taylor, can you find out from them who in their group would work on EGM?  Is it them or attorneys within their groups?

I need to have this information today if possible.

Thanks,
Edie

Subject: RE: GTC Change for removal of HPL language


Savita,

 As we have discussed, when Enron sold HPL to AEP, Enron specifically agreed that all rights to the name ""Houston Pipe Line Company"" as of June 1,2001, were the sole property of AEP/HPL and that no Enron Entity would use that name.
 On or about the first of June, the EOL Long Product descriptions were modified to provide that notwithstanding that the GTC's for physical natural gas provided that all Enron transactions in Texas were to be deemed HPL transactions, that such language was overridden by the Long Product description.
Notwithstanding this modification to the Long Product description, AEP is claiming that the continued use by EOL in EOL's GTC's violates the Purchase and Sale Agreement and impinges on its trademark ""HPL"".  As we discussed last week, we have  received a letter from AEP threatening a lawsuit if we do not immediately remove the references to HPL from the EOL GTC's.

Based on what has been happening in the past several days, I completely concur that we should not require that any EOL Counterparty ""re-accept"" the physical natural gas GTC's in order to trade with ENRON.

I advise that we either (i) do nothing and risk being sued by AEP, or (ii) that we forget about making any other ""cleanup"" changes requested by Stacy and merely notify the applicable Counterparties that as evidenced by the Long Product description for physical natural gas transactions, all such transactions will continue to be with Enron, not HPL, and that the EOL GTC will be modified as of [date] to eliminate any reference to HPL.

I would suggest that this notification be done as innocuously as possible....such as on the remittance statements in/on our checks to these Counterparties or on our invoices.  We should not ask any Counterparty to sign or return anything to reflect this, nor should we request any reacceptance of out EOL GTC .

You have inquired as to the possibility of getting AEP to enter into an agreement with Enron to not change our online GTC at this time.  Frankly, at the present time the relationship between Enron and AEP is quite antagonistic..... we have several matters pending which need to be resolved.......in order to reach some type of agreement with them regarding use of the HPL name we would need to ""make it worth their while""..... and due to some of the positions Enron is currently taking, AEP would probably refuse to enter into any such side agreement with or without costly concessions . 

Thus, as I stated earlier, we should either ""do nothing"" and wait for the lawsuit....or go the ""innocuous notice"" route.

I have spoken with Mark Taylor and he concurs that under the current circumstances, these are preferable routes to the POP-Up and reacceptance  route which had been in the works for the past few months.

Please fell free to call me with any questions or comments.  If we decide to go the ""notification route"", I will promptly draft the exact language to be used.

Best Regards
Barbara

Hi Mark, Barbara,

Can we work something out with AEP whereby we don't change the online GTC for sometime? We do have language in the Product Long Description that adresses the sale of HPL. Is there any other way we can allay AEP's concern that counterparties logging onto EnronOnline are confused about the actual ownership of HPL. Thanks.

"Clearing initiative","Mary,

I have been working on a clearing initiative for EnronOnline in the past two months. Under the current structure Enron would give its counterparties an option to clear the transactions though VMAC at a fee on a trade to trade basis, so that the trades are guaranteed by a credit wrap up supplied by a third party insurance company (FSA). Please see the appended document for a description of the clearing solution.

I am aware from information from the credit group and the global finance group about the ""master netting initiative"" that you are leading. I would like to seat with you to discuss where our initiatives might overlap each other and where they might complement each other.

Appended are the documents that describe the initiative at a high level.

"(01-372) EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP T	RANSACTIONS","Notice No. 01-372
November 2, 2001

TO:		All Exchange Members / Member Firms
		All Clearing Members

FROM: 	J. Robert Collins, Jr., President

RE:		EXCHANGE TO LOWER COST OF EXCHANGE OF FUTURES FOR SWAP
TRANSACTIONS

The New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., today announced that it would lower
the cost of exchange of futures for swap (EFS) transactions to $2.50 per
contract per side from $10 per contract per side and would apply the
discounted fee retroactively to the natural gas transactions conducted since
the start of the program yesterday.

We are gratified that the strong response to the introduction of this
trading instrument will allow us to so heavily discount the transaction fee.

The Exchange introduced EFS transactions in its natural gas futures market
yesterday as the first step of its plans to offer clearing services to the
over-the-counter (OTC) natural gas market.  In its first full day, there
were 11,100 contracts that changed hands in EFS transactions.

EFS transactions work similarly to exchange of futures for physical (EFP)
transactions.  Two parties are allowed to privately negotiate the execution
of an integrated over-the-counter swaps and related futures transaction on
pricing terms agreed upon by the involved parties.  The transaction must
involve approximately equal but opposite side-of-market quantities of
futures and swap exposures in the same or related commodities and are
permitted until two hours after trading terminates in the underlying futures
contract.

EFS transactions are permitted to liquidate, initiate, and transfer futures
market positions between the two parties involved in the transaction.  The
clearing member representing each party is responsible to notify the
Exchange of the amount of futures contracts involved, the price at which the
futures transaction should be cleared, and the identity of the parties
involved.

Year-to-date average daily volume in natural gas futures is approximately
60,000 contracts.  Yesterday's volume, including the EFS transactions was
73,364 natural gas futures contracts.

SUMMARY:  At or near inflection points, stock calls are all about the big
picture.  This is particularly true of cyclicals like energy.  Although
execution is always important for differentiating between companies,
company specifics mean relatively little to investors right now compared to
the big picture.  We believe the broad market and energy stocks
(particularly oil and gas stocks) currently discount an economic recovery
in 2H'02 and that commodity prices will not crater and will begin to
improve with economic conditions.  Valuation for energy stocks is neither
particularly cheap nor expensive at this point in the cycle.  Hard to hate
them; hard to love them.  15% moves in either direction would create more
interest from us to buy or to sell.  Would call news over the weekend
(particularly Russian) as negative, especially in light of the light volume
rally on Friday, which has put the stocks ahead of where they should be on
a trading basis.

THE BIG PICTURE:  Crude oil fundamentals and pricing are appropriately the
current focus of investors and this has been driving energy stocks on a
trading basis.  We aren't going to be disappointed by the amount of news
flow, as many issues will be relatively quick to play out within the next
several months.

   Russia:  Recent news is negative.  Promised reduction in output from
   30k/day to 50k/day is a disappointment and makes future OPEC cuts and
   compliance more risky.  Volume reductions will be revisited on December
   10th, but near-term damage has been done.  Conclusion:  downward
   pressure.
   Iraq:  Nothing is obvious about Iraq.  Sanctions renewal is coming up in
   just a few weeks.  News is surprisingly quiet on this front - with
   pricing mechanism complaints the only recent commentary from Iraqi
   government.  Intriguing that Russia scuttled the US/Britain calls for
   smart sanctions last renewal period, but now have much more to gain by
   encouraging events that prompt Iraq to leave the export market, boost
   crude prices and help Russia win on both volume and price.  However,
   Russian companies are the big winners in rejuvenating Iraqi oilfields,
   so do they want to alienate Iraq here?  A blurb over the weekend that
   Iraq caught some Iranian plotters against Saddam Hussein, which adds to
   overall confusion on the Iraqi situation.  Conclusion: Upside pressure.
   War In Afghanistan:  Current successes are good for the economy and
   crude demand, but also reduces the near-term risk of supply disruptions.
   War premium coming out of crude.  Conclusion:  Downward pressure.
   Economy/Energy Fundamentals:  Recent US economic datapoints appear to be
   modestly better than experts have predicted.  Europe as bad as expected.
   Japan remains dismal.  Lower crude and gasoline prices are nice stimulus
   for disposable income (just in time for Xmas shopping).  However, even
   if shoppers are mobbing Wal Mart, worldwide energy demand still appears
   to be falling on the margin.  Crude inventories rising at a brisk pace
   vs. historical norms for this time of year and more OPEC (and non-OPEC)
   cuts and compliance are needed to maintain a price in the high-teens/low
   $20/barrel level.  Conclusion:  Near-term downside pressure but glimmers
   of hope via economy.
   US/Europe Political Issues:  You have to assume that US and European
   governments care more about reasonably priced (or cheap) crude oil to
   stimulate the economy than anything else - but also don't want economic
   chaos in the Middle East.  We continue to gather intelligence from our
   Washington contacts that the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be used
   to support prices, but not until WTI crude is in the mid-teens.
   Conclusion:  Modest downward pressure.
   Israel/Palestine:  More violence over the long weekend.  Still no signs
   that OPEC countries taking a significant stance on this issue.  Watch
   the rhetoric - that will come before any action on OPEC's part.
   Conclusion:  Neutral with more likely upside pressure than downside
   pressure.
   Enron Situation:  If ENE craters, the impact on energy markets is
   unquantified, but certainly significant.  Who knows about what ripple
   effects could (and are) occurring.  Conclusion:  ????
   Natural Gas:  Warm weather and weak industrial demand are a bad combo.
   Thank your lucky stars that it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving
   when last week's ugly AGA gas inventory numbers were reported.  Falling
   gas rigcount is the only near term savior and that is occurring.  Gas
   problems will work themselves out faster than crude and hence our bias
   toward gassy stocks - note that the street has also figured this out as
   the gassy names have had the best performance off the bottom.
   Conclusion:  Stinky and everyone knows it.  Trading influence only.
   Investors are really watching crude oil for the next big move (in either
   direction) for the stocks.

STOCKS:   Overall, incorporating fundamentals, sentiment and valuation, the
sector is closer to a buy than a sell.   In June 2001, we worried about 3
shoes that could drop as a result of the soft economy.  Nat gas prices (and
sentiment).  Crude oil prices (and sentiment).  Earnings expectations.  All
three have happened and it will take a lot of bad news on the items
discussed above to take energy stocks to new lows (OSX <$59, XNG <$167).
That doesn't imply a huge run to new highs either.  The problems in OPEC
have shaken investor confidence and therefore we think that energy will lag
in a rally of the cyclicals.  It has become boring to write the concluding
paragraphs of these notes as the conclusion has not changed much.  Big
investors should go against the grain and buy the hard down moves.  Small
investors should be more valuation sensitive on entry points.

"quick update","(1)  Met with Alan A. and Barbara G about disruption (physical and financial) at Alan's request.  Explained financial position and updated him on what we've discovered.
(2)  NYMEX did not operate today at all on new system.  Say they will try for tomorrow.
(3)  Am told that Platts published some indices today including crude.  Will publish MTBE (and other products) tomorrow irrespective of whether NYMEX publishes.  Will also publish methodology.
(4)  Emailed ISDA Gen. Counsel Kinberly Summe about including us in industry correspondence/conference calls about ""Best Practices"" statements.
(5)  Thus far, disrupted indices seem to include only the following dailies:
	NYMEX daily 
	OPIS
	Platts
	spreads (common pricing issue)
(6)  Looks like MDE will occur if NYMEX fails to publish tomorrow.  We should identify affected counterparties.  Traders may want to negotiate anyway.  Seems like they are hoping for unified industry stance just for ease and solidarity.  I'll talk to Kim Theriot in the morning.

"President's Newsletter, Issue 6","
Monmouth College 	Trustee Newsletter
				. . . 	from the President's Office


Issue 6, December 11, 2001

As we enter into finals week here at Monmouth College, it is yet another
reminder that the Holiday season is already upon us.  We have had an
excellent first semester, and we look forward to continued hard work and
good fortune.  I hope that 2002 is a year of health and happiness for you
and those dear to you.

	*	The Monmouth choirs under the direction of Dr. Perry White,
recently held their Christmas concert, entitled ""Christmas at Monmouth:
Come, Hurry and Run.""  It was extremely well attended and beautifully done.
This concert has become a part of the Holiday festivities and traditions in
the Monmouth community.

	*	This past Sunday, Sandy and I held the annual President's
Reception for the Monmouth community in the Morgan Room of Poling Hall.  A
wonderful time to share Holiday joy with local citizens!

	*	Last Friday after work, faculty and staff gathered for the
President's Christmas Party.  This annual event was held at the Monmouth
Country Club, and Mike Olson, who will be retiring at the end of this
semester, was honored by his department chairman, Dr. Terry Glasgow.

	*	Over the past several weeks numerous research presentations
have been conducted by students in the Honors Program as part of their
culminating experience.

	*	This semester marked the initiation of pedagogy sessions for
the faculty.  The first topic was ""Effective Use of Questions""; the second
topic was ""The Effective Use of Instructional Technology in the Classroom.""

	*	A newly initiated colloquium series, sponsored by Dean
Arnold and Dr. Fasano of the Physics department, was held on Friday
afternoons this semester.  This series included presentations by faculty
dealing with their research and teaching interests, as well as their
scholarly activities.

	*	The curriculum review, under the direction of Dean Arnold,
continues to move forward.  Monthly reports on the groups' activities have
been sent to you via email or regular mail.

	*	The play entitled, ""The Visit,"" was performed to full houses
this fall by our Theater Department.  This was the last play directed by Dr.
James DeYoung, who will be retiring at the end of this academic year.

	*	The Woodrow Wilson Scholar this fall was the former
ambassador to Norway, Thomas Loftus, who spent a week with students and
faculty discussing important national and international political events.

	*	It was a great fall for Monmouth College athletics.  The
football team completed a turn-around by going 8 and 2 under second year
coach, Steve Bell, who was named Midwest Conference Football Coach of the
Year.  Thirteen Fighting Scots' football players were named to the
All-Midwest Conference team.

	*	For the first time in the College's history, our men's
soccer team, under Coach Rue Carthew who was named Midwest Conference Soccer
Coach of the Year, won the conference championship and advanced to NCAA
National Tournament play.  Senior goalie Joel Cowan was named conference
player of the year.  The Fighting Scots Soccer Team was eventually defeated
by Luther College of Iowa in NCAA play.

	*	This past Saturday marked the first of three academic
scholarship competition days held on campus.  Typically, this is the
smallest of the three days because of its proximity to Christmas, but the
number of scholars on campus, compared to last year's first program,
increased from 15 to 22.

	*	Admission numbers are soaring at this early date.  As of
December 8th, we had 799 applications, which compared very favorably to the
four previous years, which were 539, 579, 543 and 583.

	*	We continue to work with an admissions consultant who is
helping our staff implement a prospect management and inquiry grading
system.  The staff is also preparing to enhance publications and
communications flow for the 2003 recruitment year.

	*	Board member David Byrnes, Chairman of the Admissions
Committee of the Board, recently participated in a two-day retreat with the
staff and our consultant.  Dave's input and insights will be very helpful to
us as we move forward.

	*	The College has received a revised proposal to enhance our
marketing efforts from George Dehne and Associates.  Several Board members
and several vice presidents joined me for a meeting with Dehne in Chicago in
November.

	*	Our new Director of Intercultural Life has completed an
overseas recruitment trip to several countries in the southern part of
Africa and strong interest has resulted.  She also attended four specific
international/minority college fairs and is organizing current international
and minority students to assist in recruitment by making phone calls,
writing letters, etc.

	*	The City Zoning Board recently approved the development plan
for the northwest corner of campus.  This will include the construction of
six new tennis courts, two football practice fields, and a parking lot for
150 cars.  Campus fencing, signage and lighting are also included in the
plan, which should be completed this summer.

	*	College administrators will seek permission to close North
Seventh Street when they meet with the Zoning Board in January.  This will
be necessary in order to begin construction on the Huff Center.

	*	The College continues to plan for the renovation and
remodeling of the College Chapel/Auditorium.  If all progresses according to
schedule, work will begin within the next several months.

	*	Construction on the top floor of  Hewes Library is nearing
completion and should be ready when students return in January.  Work on the
lower two levels will then begin, with completion of the entire library
project scheduled for Homecoming 2002.

	*	The silent phase of the capital campaign continues to
progress well ahead of schedule.  Approximately 85% of Board members have
made pledges, and many of the remaining 15% are considering proposals.

	*	This Thursday, Red Poling and I will be visiting with
officers of the Kresge Foundation in Troy, Michigan to present a proposal
for support of the capital campaign.

	*	Thanks to the Green Army and the College Relations staff,
the campus is beautifully decorated for the Holiday season.  Weather remains
unseasonably warm, but very few are complaining.

Sandy and I wish you all a very Happy Holiday Season, and we again thank you
for the tremendous support and enthusiasm that you have demonstrated for
Monmouth College.

"Master Netting Agreement","All, attached is a redline of Master Netting Agreement against the previous Cook c draft and the proposed Collateral Annex.  Please review and provide your comments to me by first thing Tuesday morning.

Major issues for resolution:

1.  We have determined that we should file on cash collateral in Canada.  Peter Keohane is reviewing the forms and processes for such, including how to determine and establish priority with respect to same.  Peter will coordinate with Credit concerning the mechanics of accomplishing the filings.

2.  Due to the continued concern by some counsel in respect of mutuality issues for setoff and netted settlement (another form of setoff) ""aggregate liability clauses"" set forth in 3a and 3b have been included for our consideration.  We must come to a consensus as to whether this language/concept should/must be included.  If the answer is yes, is the language included the best tactic?

3.  Mary Perkins is reviewing LC matters with banks to be sure the modified format set forth in this draft is satisfactory.

Timing Objective:  Our objective is to provide everyone another draft on Tuesday and finalize on Wednesday.  This will require a conference call sometime Monday afternoon.  Carol, Rick, David, Peter and Elizabeth please provide Esmeralda Gonzalez, my assistant, at 713 345-7621 with your Monday afternoon availability and she will set a time and advise you.


   
For those of you who had a prior draft of the Collateral Annex, I could not get this redlined for some reason, I apologize.  

Carol, since I am out Friday will you please call Cadwalader and be sure they received this.  Further, will you ask them to review the NY choice of law provision in light of Canada cash collateral issue.  Thank you.

David and Rick, in your review please give special attention to the calculation mechanisms utilized for the determination of the Collateral Requirement.

Esmeralda, after you have determined availability, please send email to Carol, Elizabeth, Rick Antonoff, David Mitchell and Peter Keohane advising of the time (Houston time).  We will call other parties and do not need a call in number.

"Curricular Review Task Force Report #9","Curricular Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report # 9 (October 1, 2001)

The Curriculum Review Task Force held its first meeting for the academic
year on August 23, 2001. We reviewed the work done last May to tie up loose
ends and to plan the work for the year. During the intensive work sessions
in the last week of May, the eight faculty members of the Task Force
(including the Chair) had made detailed presentations to our group on eight
topics related to the Curriculum Review (Please see my last report for
details). It was decided that these members would write a summary of their
presentations, including their cited references, and circulate them to the
other members of the Task Force. After reviewing these summaries, and
remembering the strategic curricular initiatives collectively decided on by
our faculty and staff during the Purser-Gans Conference, each Task Force
member was asked to come up with five Educational Goals which would guide
our future work.

Meanwhile, it had been decided in consultation with the Faculty Senate that
the Fall Faculty/Staff Conference would focus on the Curricular Review. The
Task Force had decided last May that the first two curricular initiatives to
be considered are (1) Reinvestment in Pedagogy and (2) Communication Across
the Curriculum. These two topics became the key themes for the Faculty/Staff
Conference. The Task Force met with the Conference Planning Group on August
20 and it was agreed that the small group discussions will be led by seven
Task Force members. The Faculty Conference held on August 23 was very
productive in providing valuable input for the work of the Task Force. In a
general sense the Conference gave a vote of confidence for the work and
approach of the CRTF. We have taken detailed notes of the discussions in the
small groups and the plenary session.

On September 12th and 19th, the Task Force held intensive work sessions in
the Boone House from 5:30 to 9:00 p.m. Each member, as agreed earlier,
brought a list of five Educational Goals and after a lengthy discussion we
have arrived at six educational goals and a list of operational ends for
each of them. These goals focus on the competencies to be developed by our
students and the learning outcomes of our academic program. After these are
finalized, we will arrange an open meeting to discuss them with our faculty.

On September 24, the Task Force met with the Assessment Committee and Dr.
Susan Holm, Chair of the MFL department. The Assessment Committee discussed
with us its plans and the list of eight Assessment Review Questions prepared
by the Committee. Dr. Holm discussed the role of foreign language learning
in the liberal arts education, the recent changes in MFL
majors/minors/concentration and her department=s plans for further changes.
The details of these discussions will be available in our minutes which will
be posted in the public folders later this week. To access this folder,
please go to Public Folders, All Public Folders, Documents, College,
Curricular Review Task Force. We are planning to meet with other departments
in the near future. Thanks.

Raj Ambrose, Chair
Curriculum Review Task Force.

During the North American Energy and Developing Products Committee meeting
on November 2, the group discussed NYMEX's intention to close on Friday,
November 23.  This date appears to be an unscheduled holiday.  The issue we
pose to the Committee is the following:

1.  Should ISDA issue a market practice statement on the November 23 closing
of NYMEX?

2.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, what treatment should result for
November 23?

3.  If ISDA should issue such a statement, how should options that expire on
November 23 be treated?  (This may be less of an issue for European style
options).

4.  What types of Market Disruption Events are typically included in your
contracts?

I would direct your attention to Section 1.4 of the 1993 ISDA Commodity
Derivatives Definitions (definition of Commodity Business Day) and ISDA's
Market Practice Statement on Equity Derivatives (available on our website),
where September 11, 12, 13 and 14 were not considered trading days for
equity derivatives purposes.

I would be grateful if you could respond to Kimberly Summe (ksumme@isda.org)
on each of the four questions above. Also, I propose to have a conference
call on Friday, November 9 at 10:30 a.m. New York Time.  The call-in details
are set forth below:

Non-US Callers:		865 523 8154
US Callers:		800 281 4634

Participant Code:	503 399

Please respond to the four questions and your availability for the call on
Friday.  If the group decides to go forward with a market practice
statement,  I would propose finalizing a market practice statement next
week.

Thank you in advance.

Kimberly Summe
General Counsel

"EOL - new Product - JPY / KL WTI Swap","Dear Mike and John,

Not sure to which of you I should have addressed this email since you are both listed as doing liquid fuels.  If I am wrong and it is neither of you would be really grateful if you could pass this email to the right EGM lawyer ASAP (with a copy to me so I know with whom to follow up).  

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the draft product descriptions and GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  We are hoping to get this approved by Wednesday Tokyo time so if this needs to be passed on, I would be grateful if you could do this today (your time).

RE product Descriptions - in addition to those changes which were needed to reflect the fact that the products are in yen and KL (and not in USD and Barrels) , we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.

I have actually only made one small change to the GTCs, to provide for kiloliters in the rounding off clause.  I assume that given that NY law will apply, that we don't usually amend the arbitration clause in the case of products likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I can answer the question that you have in regards to what extent the product descriptions differ from the existing swaps being traded by ENA. The only difference will be the currency - nothing else.

Stefan,

Sorry I didn't respond sooner; it's been really hectic around here.

The GTC looks fine; it's the standard GTC for ENA financial products.

The product descriptions generally look fine as well.  One question I have, however, is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ (apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY) from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA?

Also, the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that: 

""the products are part of Enron Japan's overall effort to extend Enron's crude and products business to Japan.  It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements.""  

Pursuant to our previous discussions and e-mails, I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products.  If this is not the case, we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product (e.g., such as marketing).  Please confirm what the facts are going to be (as they currently stand).

Best regards,
Susan

Below are the documents Jane sent to Legal HOU for approval. 
As you see we intent to be live by Thursday. We hope to have the documents in the system later today (Wed. your time). Could you take a look at the documents and let Jane/me know if you see any issues in signing off on the product? We might want to ask you for sign-off by tomorrow.

Thanks!

Subject:	RE: EOL - New Product - JPY denominated WTI Swap 
Importance:	High

Dear Frank,

Many thanks for helping out on this.  Should be pretty straight forward I think because it is not a ""new"" product so much as a slightly revised version of an existing product (US WTI).  

There has also been a development which makes it even simpler.  At first the product was going to be WTI (which is usually in USD and barrels) in JPY and kiloliters but apparently EOL have said kiloliters wont actually work so the only twist is that this product will be in yen and not USD.

I have therefore amended the documents I sent yesterday (so I hope you haven't looked at them yet ...) to take the barrel / KL conversion language out (and to remove the glitch from the Business Day definition in the GTCs).  

Accordingly, this email is exhaustive and you can ignore the one I sent yesterday (which was at the bottom of Alan's email to me).

I am attaching a number of documents.  

(i)	The first is an internal memo re two new products Enron Japan wants to put on EOL.  The Enron CP will be ENA which is why I need your help before going to Mark.  The memo describes the product generally and how it will work (and sets out the background as to why EJ is pushing this initiative).  This is FYI only.

(ii) & (iii)	These are the (ii) draft product descriptions and (iii) GTCs and we need ENA legal sign off re same.  If you are happy with these then I will pass to Mark Taylor for final approval (assuming I still need his approval if you have approved - can you confirm this I wonder).  If you have any questions, please let me know.  

Both documents have been prepared based on the product descriptions and the GTCs currently used for the USD WTI product.

Re the Product Descriptions - in addition to those changes to the US WTI product description which were needed to reflect the fact that these products are in yen (and not in USD), we have used upper case for Business Days (because it is defined in the GTCs and the definition is important because it will not refer to Japanese holidays) and I have incorporated a new definition ""the relevant Scheduled Trading Date"" so that in accordance with what I understand to be standard EOL procedure, the top half of the product description can be the same for both products (despite the fact that the currency exchange will be done 3 days after a different date in the case of the two definitions) and only the bottom half will need to change.  (I know this is not a great way to include definitions in an agreement but I am just trying to keep my changes consistent with the current WTI Product Description methodology. 

I have made no changes to the current WTI GTCs.  I have assumed that when NY law applies to ""foreign"" products, we don't usually amend the arbitration clause despite the fact that the products are likely to be purchased by non-US counter parties.  I am less sure however about the events of default clause.  The language seems pretty short and generic so I suspect that we probably don't put CP jurisdiction specific events in but please confirm.

I understand you are all under pressure there so wonder when you expect you would be able to revert so that I can let the business people here know.  Apparently  GTCs can only be loaded once a week at Wed. noon (HOU time) so unless you can see your way through to doing this during your Tuesday (i.e. today your time) - provided I hear from you by Tuesday next week, this would be fine.

Re Exchange Rate, Sara Shackleton suggested recently that a central bank rate would be better then a Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi rate but the BTM exchange rates are market standard here so we would prefer to use these.  This may be because BTM is listed on the NYSE and so is seen as international.

As just spoke with Frank and he will help you on this. But, I do want to warn you that everyone here, including Frank, is engaged in a number of high priority projects related to, among other things, entering into master netting agreements and the like to manage the credit issues affecting the Company. Accordingly, the timetable for a reply may not be in line with your expectations.

Jane, I noted that the draft of the GTCs had a glitch in the Business Day definition. You should resend to Frank.
