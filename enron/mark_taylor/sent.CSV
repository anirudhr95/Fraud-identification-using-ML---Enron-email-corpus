Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it
back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume
that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit
more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the
back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was
a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get
away even close to on time?

"RE:","David,

Thanks for your note.  Glad to hear you and yours are well.  

We docked in Southampton on Monday morning so I was already in our London office on Tuesday and just back from lunch when the news started coming through.  I was traveling with a couple of friends from NYC (Amanda McGovern, Noble Black's UVA classmate, and Linda Hayman, her mom and a friend of mine from my Skadden days) so it was rather tense for a while as we tried to find their friends but everyone came through pretty well.  Our return had been scheduled for Wednesday of that week so of course we were stranded in London but made it back Sunday.  Not that we were having much fun, but there were worse places to be stranded.  I felt bad for the QE2 passengers on their way from Southampton to NYC.  They would have gotten the news on their first day at sea and had to spend what should have been a pleasant cruise thinking about events and worrying.

I've heard good things from both Anne and Brad about your meeting here in Houston.  Thanks for getting into that.  It sounds like exactly what we needed.  I have been talking to Barbara and she will check with Frank concerning the letter.

I'll look forward to chatting sometime soon so I can hear what's been happening with you and how you are coping.  Hope it is all going as smoothly as possible.  Linda tells me that New York is a changed place -- nearly empty evenings and weekends.

Mark

Mark,

First off, I hope that your family and friends are all well.  I feel very
lucky in that my family, friends and colleagues are all okay.  I kept
thinking about you and wasn't sure if you were stuck on the ship at the
time.  What happened - how did you get back?

On a more mundane, although important, note I thought I would update you on
some recent events.

We had a great meeting a few weeks back with Anne Koehler, Brad Richter and
Rex Shelby.  We helped them consider the various legal and practical issues
that would face Enron should you chose to host internet sites for customers
(as opposed to licensing the software to a company and letting them host
their own sites).  As it turns out, the business team decided to do some
more analysis before proceeding.

Pam Kavieff has asked us for help with eProjects (online auction sites for
construction projects) and we have provided documents to her team.

Barbara Gray has also asked for help on a project involving AEP.  I think
she wanted to clear this with you.

In that regard, I just confirmed with my assistant that I did not receive a
signed fee letter back from Frank Sayer ( I had sent one to him after we
meet with him several months ago).  We can either try to find that letter
and see if Frank signed it (or have him sign it) or I can send a new letter
to your attention.  In fairness to you, there may be a few things you need
to review (e.g., fax, copying charges come to mind).

Best regards,

David

I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

"RE: GEA Rainey","Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned ""that they are good at being number 2.""  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  George did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.

Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM. 

Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!

"Payment Amount Calculation","Example 1

Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a ""Loss"" to Party A from the termination)
Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a ""Gain"" to Party B from the termination)
There are no Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99
Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)



Example 2

Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39
Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)

"RE: Let's Go Sailing!","Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?  Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.

Such prices shall be calculated by multiplying the Flat Rate (as defined below) for the route known as [""70,000 tonnes loading Puerto La Cruz to Corpus Christi""] by the World Scale (or ""WS"") under the heading 'The Baltic International Tanker Route (BITR) Baltic Dirty Tanker Index (BDTI); Route [9]' whenever published by The Baltic Exchange Limited within the Determination Period. The Flat Rate is the rate in US dollars per metric tonne as published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.  in effect on the last day of the Determination Period for the above mentioned route.  If for any reason the Baltic Exchange Limited does not provide any prices during the Determination Period, then the Forward Freight Agreement Brokers Association (""FFABA"") may be instructed by either Enron or Counterparty to form a panel to establish such price, which will be binding on both Counterparty and Enron.
The price quoted on EnronOnline is World Scale (or ""WS""), expressed as a percentage of the Flat Rate. The Contractual Currency will be US dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be metric tonnes and the quantity shown shall be the number of LOTs per Determination Period (each LOT being 5000 metric tonnes).

"RE: STANDARDIZATION OF TANKER FREIGHT WORDING","I'm still concerned about the terms ""price"" and ""quotation.""  My understanding was that ""Worldscale"" is not a number denominated in a currency but rather a percentage number which can be used with reference to a currency denominated figure to calculate a price.  That is what it looks like in the Baltic Exchange Limited publication.  I haven't seen the IITRA publication so can't comment on how their quotations are denominated.  The problem is that in the first paragraph of the long description, the Floating Price is defined to be the Index.  Therefore the Index must be a currency denominated number.  That is why in the US version I used the average of the prices ""calculated using the Worldscale Assessments.""  Do I have this all wrong?

Matt tks for the points

with the exception of the first issue re EEFT arranging etc, I wd say that yr proposed amendments shd certainly apply to the UK freight swaps. I will just check with the commercial people to make sure that the Index is going to be IITRA and that they are happy to go for the flat rate on the last day of the Determination Period. tks

Subject:	Re: STANDARDIZATION OF TANKER FREIGHT WORDING

Mark / Robert / Justin

I refer to Debbie Nicholl's e-mail on how Houston/London/Singapore language for freight swaps should be consistent. Here are my comments on the Singapore product which I drafted in consultation with Paul Henking/Pat Markey who would be trading the product here.  Your views would be most appreciated:

1.	1st para : ""as arranged by Enron Europe Finance & Trading Limited"" would not apply to Singapore and therefore not included. 

2. 	Index defininition:

(a)	In the 1st sentence, I think reference should be to ""the arithmetic average of quotations"" instead of ""the arithmetic average of the prices"" to be consistent with the other swap products Singapore has on-line. This also distinguishes between a ""quotation"" which is an IITRA published quote and ""price"" which in existing EOL products refers to the bid/offer price on EOL.  

(b)	I understand the bid/offer prices on EOL for freight swaps are quoted in ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"" values instead of US$, hence the 2nd last para which reads :

""The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, expressed as ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"", which shall be the Contractual Currency.""

(c)	Since both quotations and prices are ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"" values (ie. a flat rate determined by the route X the daily variable rate), I have expressed it as ""The flat rate (expressed as ""Worldscale"" or ""WS"") used in the quotations and to calculate the price..."" so as to clarify that the flat rate is a determinant of the ""quotations"" as well as ""price"".

(d)	As identified in the Houston product, ""Worldscale"" is published by Worldscale Association (London) Limited and Worldscale Association (NYC) Inc.

(e)	Traders here have picked ""the last day of the Determination Period"" as the day to determine the flat rate (ie. ""WS"") instead of Transaction Date to avoid issues which may arise from ""WS"" amendments occurring in the middle of a Determination Period  (eg. whether to take a weighted average when calculating the arithmetic average or would the prevailing rate apply for the whole Determination Period) or between Transaction Date and Effective Date (in the case of forward transactions).

Since the flate rate effective on ""the last day of the Determination Period"" was chosen, I left out the language which appears in the Houston/London product : ""including any relevant forthcoming amendments published prior to or on such date which may become effective prior to or on the last day of the Determination Period"".  I also didn't entirely understand the reference to ""including"" and whether it was intended to mean that all the flat rates will be taken into account (weighted average?) or just the prevailing one. I understand from Robert that when the London product was drafted, it may not have been brought to Legal's attention that the flat rate may be amended (albeit unlikely), anytime during the year in addition to the annual amendments.

Attached for your easy reference is the draft Singapore product long description

Thanks. I look forward to your views. 

Best regards
Matt

Subject:	STANDARDIZATION OF TANKER FREIGHT WORDING


I have been requested to look at the attached wording from Houston and Singapore which I understand London has previously agreed, as the deadline to go live on EOL for next Monday has been missed.  

I have highlighted the inconsistencies as follows:

Blue highlights mean - Singapore, London and Houston legal need to agree on standard wording for consistency.

Mauve highlights mean - Remove as EEFT are not the arrangers for Singapore Financial transactions 

Red highlights mean - Inserted for consistency. Singapore, London and Houston legal to agree

Black underlined means - Only inserted in Houston language, Singapore London and Houston to agree 

Please review the attached and finalise your agreement between all three legal departments by forwarding a new set of standardised wording so that Tanker Freight is consistent and EOL can forward your wording to other departments for approval.  If we can do this asap EOL can post these products hopefully to go live on 2 July.


Thanks and Regards

Debbie

Subject: Migration of Clickpaper Application to EOL (Obligations to 


Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.  

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder

Robbie - here is the contract with Ariba we were discussing yesterday.  Just want to get legal coverage of a couple of issues regarding how we should proceed once we stop using Ariba for clickpaper.com.

- we will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  do we need to notify them?
- i will send them the final accounting of transactions cleared through the ariba software at the end of 3rd quarter (they invoice us for a small fee for each transaction.)  I assume no further communication with Ariba will be required on my part.
- need to determine if we need to take any steps for contract termination, or simply let the arrangement expire next spring.  presumably we do not want to renew, nor do we want to terminate early on the small chance someone might want to use the licenses in the meantime.
 
Please let me know what questions you have...

thanks
KNC

"RE: What's happening?","Raj,

Things are tough.  People are thinking tomorrow is the day for a lot of layoffs for non-core groups.  

40% chance we merge with Dynegy is what some people are saying.  Bankruptcy is our other option.

The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.     

I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.

Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?

Hey Mike!

Hope you had a great thanksgiving weekend. I used it to check out NYC!

Anyway, what's your take on the future of the firm? And how are the
employees reacting so far? It's difficult to recall a weekday when the
WSJ does not carry an
Enron-related article. And now it seems the merger is doubtful.

"RE: Lease Renewal","Veronica,

The lease automatically converts to a month-to-month lease at the beginning of August at the same rent.  That means that from then on either one of us can cancel with 30 days notice to the other if they want to.  That's ok with me if it works for you.

Please let me know when you hear back from the EOL people.
I am assuming London EOL people (?) because the Houston EOL people (Rob Cass / Kevin Meredith) were not yet aware of any forthcoming changes.
I just wanted to make sure that the Houston EOL team also stays up to date so that they can make changes too on our Houston EOL system.

Mark,

I am assuming that you are back from your London trip.

Was there success in the standardization of the Tanker Freight Swap product description?
Or was it agreed to keep the product description differentiated regionally?  
If global standardization has been implemented, has Carlos Alatorre been notified yet about any necessary changes?  

I am just checking to see where we are now to see what needs to be done next.

I think your response is exactly right.  JPMorgan is in complete agreement with
this view and will communicate that to the Fed which has also requested a
meeting with us.  Since our request for a meeting comes from our examiners (and
in view of the past views expressed by some former members of our firm) we will
actually have a meeting--but our message will be the same as yours.

 Subject: RE: Retail Swaps Invitation Letter and Questions





Two weeks ago, a member of the FRBNY legal staff asked to meet with AIG
staff to discuss AIG's present and proposed retail swap activities. I
responded that AIG does not now and has no plans to engage in that activity.
For that reason, I stated that it was premature to consider the need to
regulate an activity that does not now exist and that ought to be the
agencies response to Congress.

Subject:	RE: 2002 IT Budgets

Joe -

Thanks for the information.  As I told Cornelio in relation to the EWS - Legal Project, I am currently only responsible for the LegalOnline project and work on this under the authority of Mark Haedicke.  As to the other projects, why and how may name became associated with them is both interesting and incorrect as I am not the ""sponsor"" of any of them.

Last week I received the first indication of the need to discuss these projects in line with ENW's budget approval for ENA projects.  Since a conference call was scheduled for earlier today to discuss these items, I figured I would gather more information and forward that information to the appropriate member of the Dept. for review, consideration and action.  I was advised yesterday that the budget was approved and there was no need for today's conference call.  Despite this budget approval (without EWS Legal discussion), ENW personnel have continued to request that I ""approve"" these projects for next year - even if the approval is only as a ""placeholder"" for the budget.  I cannot do this and, quite frankly, see no value in obtaining these ""approvals"" if the budget has been approved.

If those responsible for these other projects would like me to follow-up with you on these matters and authorize me to do so, I would be more than happy to do so.  Sheila Tweed has actually asked me to do this on the ""extranet"" project, which I will be reviewing with Ed Hearn.  Once we (Ed and I) have reviewed the feasibility study proposed by Cornelio, we will determine the next steps to be taken and whether or not this project should move forward.  I will advise you accordingly.

Mark

Mark - these are the answers to your questions concerning our budgets.  Please let me know if this is OK with you.  I would be happy to discuss in person or via a phone call.  Let me know what's best for you.

Your name appearing on 2 projects for ENA?  
1)  ""EWS - Legal"" project. -  Cornelio spoke with you last night and confirmed 1 project actually belongs to Sheila Tweed.  So we will get her to approve.

2)  ""Legal Web Maint.""  - this is really 3 projects, which are:
Legal Web - Enhancements/maintenance for 2001 project converting ""ECT Legal Foreign & Domestic"", ""Jurisdiction Document Library"", and ""European Document Libarary"" Notes applications to intranet apps.  Sponsored by Mark Greenberg.
Physical and Financial Trading, Power Trading, Gas Assets and Industrial Markets Trading Agreements intranet site.  Replaces and expands 3 Master Agreements Notes applications.  Sponsored by Marc Taylor, Elizabeth Sager, Jeff Hodge, Julia Murray.  
ENA Legal Support application. Sponsored by W.L. Schuler
Can you informally approve these 3 projects?

Is this formal commitment to the projects?
No.  This is only a placeholder in the budget for these projects, not formal approval.  You would formally approve the projects once we were ready to start working on them next year.  So, you can agree to put a placeholder in the budget for the project, but cancel it next year before we begin actually working on it.

"RE: Coal Purchases Online","While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.

"Floods","It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6"" per hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water got so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab since some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the door sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in big trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I would have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the second floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did come inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midnight the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all gone.

Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the loop) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd.  You missed a big one!

1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.

3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them.

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

"Create Limit Order pop up -- does the Enron trader have the ability to accept the order before it goes live to the world?","Create Limit Order 
Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.

"Graham's leaving date","Thanks for forwarding all the e-mails while I was out last week.  I found this one in my in-box when I got back this morning.  Is it yours?
----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 05/22/2001 09:35 AM -----


	""Deborah V. Chapman"" <debchapman@eircom.net> 05/17/2001 04:52 PM 	   To: ""Mark Taylor (E-mail)"" <mtaylo1@ei.enron.com>  cc:   Subject: Graham's leaving date	



Dear Mark,

Thanks for keeping us updated on Tom. I am pleased to hear that he is making a good recovery. Please pass on our best wishes. I am wondering whether the hospital will have forwarded mum's card if he had already moved on to a convalescent home when it arrived. I have just sent a card to his home address but I do not have the post code. I hope it gets there.

I found out from Graham last night that he is returning to Somerset on Wednesday (23rd). I guess that makes it unlikely that you will get to see him this time. There is a strong possibility that he will come in October for the Jazz festival and will bring Jordan with him. Whilst he has been here he has had lots of people trying to persuade him to build houses for them, but I think he misses Jordan so much he can't wait to get home. I am amazed at how much work got done so quickly. The house in Lauragh is finished except for the painting, wood staining and floor varnishing. We can start using it now but we need to avoid putting in too much furniture until the floor is done in some of the rooms at least. Dad has been lending a hand with paths and garden walls and has helped with some painting. I am sure that Mum will help with some planting. All I need now is a couple of really nice weeks in the summer so that I can feel the benefit of it.

I hope you can find time to come over again sometime soon. When Alan returns from Vienna next week he should be in a much more relaxed mood, having got his conference presentation out of the way at last. I am sure he will be happy to spend some leisurely days with you and to take you down to Mum and Dad's and to see the house, etc. If Hilary still has her yacht when you come she might also be glad of some help to sail it. She has not ventured out in it since Richard died but is talking about sailing it if she can find some help.

Once the next month is over I can also relax a bit. We are just coming into exam time and we all get very fraught at this time of year (with the marking piling up).

At last the foot and mouth restrictions are lifting a bit and we are hoping that all riding activities can gradually resume. We have had a rather boring few months - not even able to ride out along the roads. We can now ride down to the beach but we still have to take care not to go near fields full of cattle or sheep! I have just started investigating the idea of a pony for Caitlin. She is riding my horse occasionally in the sand arena and is doing very well with him even though he is rather small for him. I think she might be ready for a pony now but finding the right one is not going to be easy.

We will look forward  to seeing you whenever you can manage to get flights.

Bye for now,

Deb

    I apologize for not getting this to you earlier.  This is a draft of a
license under which Enron Networks could disclose its data formats.  It is
very basic, but I think covers the points that we discussed last week.

    I will be out of town on vacation, starting tomorrow.  But I have
briefed Rasmani Bhattacharya, an attorney at V&E who works with me on this
types of projects, and she can make any amendments or changes that may be
necessary.  You can reach Rasmani at 713 758-2109.

    I have left some questions in the form, which need to be addressed and
edited.  Also, we should ask Jay what we should call these formats.  I just
made up a term.  He will be able to come up with a better one, I am sure.

    Rasmani, you should have rights to this document, but if there is some
problem, just save it as a new document and go from there.  The iManage
number is 599547.  Also, please feel free to expand and clarify the
disclaimers and limits of the license.  Also, would you get with Tony Chan
and go over this draft with him.  I based this draft in large part on what
he gave me.  Thanks.

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all ""legally approved"" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.

I'm living in Houston these days.  I was actually in London on 9/11.  My flight back (scheduled for Wednesday that week) was cancelled and I finally made it back on that Sunday.  I'm sure there were much worse places to be stranded but it wasn't a lot of fun being away from home then.  I was traveling with a couple of good friends from NYC and it was pretty tense trying to track down their friends in Manhattan.

Mark K. is in NYC.  I have heard from him and he and his family are fine.  I think his company is now called American Century and he is still managing international mutual funds.

I was in Monmouth last weekend for homecoming.  Dahlquist, McGehee, McCabe, Perschke, Vance and Ehrenhart were there.  Ehrenhart actually has a son who is a freshman at Monmouth and has joined ZBT.  

Hope you guys are doing well.

Thanks for your thoughts Mark.  I may call you as well.  I think we have it
worked out.  I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow.  I am
working on putting together a quick trip out West as a consolation for
Amanda.  She always wanted to see Grand Canyon.  I know that pales in
comparison to a Paris cafe but it will have to do for now.  I am generally
dismissive of the risks of travelling but this event has affected me deeply.
And I think you are right that Amanda hasn't felt that yet.  I would love to
ignore it or downplay it but I can't.

Do you know of any spa/resort type places in the Southwest that would meet
the Hayman standard?  (I know you know what I mean by the Hayman standard).

Subject: RE: International Travel


I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.
Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the
airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases
the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations
number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I
will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest
relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we
weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I
don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least
not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police
presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans
while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here
for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans
just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.
The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during
some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly
country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good
to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very
sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and
so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.
Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do
something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.
For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon,
although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will
improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you
since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees
two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of
events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you
aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

Mark

Do you actually have to be in Woodstock to find a boat to charter for a sunset cruise?  Could I send you some phone numbers or something.  If you aren't going to arrive until Saturday, we could waste a lot of time driving around to boat yards on the Hudson.  I think we should have a sunset cruise for 6.

Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it
back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume
that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit
more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the
back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was
a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get
away even close to on time?

Frank,

FYI, attached is an e-mail from Janine Juggins who works in the Enron Europe Tax Dept.  I sent her an e-mail this morning trying to set up a call after the All Employee Meeting because I guessed that she had been looking at our issue from the London side.  She is going to call me at 4 p.m. Houston time this afternoon to discuss what she has found out to date.  Also, one of the attached e-mails suggests that all the London financially settled contracts will be entered into through EFET LLC (rather than ECTRIC) beginning 1 November.  I will confirm that with Janine when I talk with her this afternoon.

After reading the attached e-mail string, I still think it makes the most sense to have ENA enter into the transactions with the hedge funds (and thus have the transactions be entered into under the ENA ISDA).  This assumes, of course, that (1) the counterparties are US or Bermuda based hedge funds as we discussed yesterday, and (2) the New York or Houston office (rather than the London office) is executing and confirming these transactions.  We should confirm these assumptions with Robyn.  Do you see any reason why this approach would not work for non-EnronOnline transactions?  Also, based on the attached e-mail string, it looks like we're trying to set this up for both EnronOnline and  OTC contracts.  Were you aware of this?

I will give you a call shortly to discuss.

Best regards,
Susan

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Are multiparty ISDAs a real option ? This seems like the simplest solution.

If not, I think we are back to the alternatives mentioned below.

With respect to the spread products I believe there are no spread books as such, each risk is laid off to the respective books. In this case, a good rule of thumb would be to have the spread product offered by ENA (thus it is ENA who contracts with the hedge fund) and then ENA lays off the relevant risk (in the WTI/Brent example ENA lays off Brent to ECTRIC). The only issue I see with this is offering the product when ENA is closed, as traders in London cannot act on behalf of ENA (or alternatively traders in Houston could work extended hours ?).

Russell, do the hedge funds operate only out of New York, or would they operate out of London or other European offices also ? I am just wondering how much of an issue the trading hours would be.

To clarify, using ENA as the contracting party for all global liquids products would risk exposing ENA to a UK tax presence (assuming that traders continue to be based in London). Since a significant proportion of Enron's total income is earned by ENA this would be an unacceptable risk (any UK tax paid cannot offset the US tax liability because of certain limitations that apply to Enron - thus most of the UK tax paid represents an additional cost). 

Regards
Janine

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.  There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.

Drew -- I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction.

I am working with Ranelle Paldino on an issue... This message (shown below) is at the bottom of each of our email messages sent outside Enron.  Craig Buehler sends Contract info via email.  I was attempting to get approval to get this taken off Craig's email messages.  The Corp Messaging team pointed me to Legal.    Thanks.  Jean  x51615

Mark,

Further to my voicemail.  The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) has asked to have the old lines from NatWest novated to RBS.  The 2 banks merged approx. 2 years ago.

RBS will send the originals to the appropriate person within Enron.

Would you please advise as to who, in your view, would be the appropriate person to handle this novation.

Many thanks in advance,
Suzanne Ferlic
011 44 207 783 4249


See below for RBS detail:


Line Limits are:
 
NW FX & DSL, US$13m, 2 yrs, no security
 
NW CRRM, US$97m, 15 yrs, has gtee from Enron Corp
 
Please let me know where and to whom we can send the original documents
to.
Thanks,
Jamie

Hi Suzanne,
 
Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-
 
1.  Novation Agreement

*	You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance in
NY soon
*	This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*	To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex 

*	Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom and
return via fax
*	As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*	To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*	See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement letter.
*	This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*	Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter. 
 
One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.
 
 
Thanks and regards,

Attached is an electronic version of the Merger Agreement that we executed with Dynegy.  As is typical with these types of transactions, there are limitations imposed on Enron's operations between signing and closing of the Merger Agreement.  Please help ensure that each transaction entered into by Enron and its subsidiaries complies with the agreement, and particularly Section 7.1 of the agreement relating to conduct of business.  Peter del Vecchio (at ext. 39875) and Joe Henry (at ext. 51549) are available to help address specific questions regarding our interim operations.  Rob Walls, John Ale, Mark Haedicke and myself are also available, and we will help determine if we need Dynegy's consent for any particular proposed transaction.  We are in the process of summarizing the interim covenants, as well as establishing certain procedures to ensure our compliance.  I anticipate distributing these items on Thursday.  We are also having prepared a memorandum regarding certain anti-trust and other issues that we need to consider in any involvement we have with Dynegy regarding our respective operations.  We currently plan on having various presentations regarding the anti-trust matters.  Please pass the merger agreement and the subsequent materials on to others in your group as you think appropriate.  Thank you for your help and understanding in this matter.  Lance.

Guest ID's are usually valid for two weeks. We can go longer than two weeks. How long do you want him to have access for? Finally it is probably a good idea for mark Taylor to know that a regulator is asking for access to EnronOnline. He may want to suggest an appropriate period of time for the access.

Lisa Lees is in charge of customer access but I usually authorise anything more than 2 weeks.

I hope you are enjoying your new job!  Sounds like a great opportunity.    I need to ask you for a favor.  We are working with the Wyoming Govenor and the Wyoming Business Council to develop positive relations between Enron and the State of Wyoming.  Paul Kauffman is trying to get the Govenor to support his ideas regarding the RTO in the West and we are working with them to manage some of their price risk on their royalties as well as support our development efforts in the state.

One thing that would help us in our relations is to help the Govenor's staff understand Enron's market making capabilities.  In order to do this I would like to get a member of his staff access to EOL.  He would need read only access, but I would not want him to be turned off after 2 weeks.  If you can help me with this I would really appreciate it.

His name is Shawn Taylor, and his e-mail address is staylo2@state.wy.us

If someone can call me I will help orchestrate his registration.

My number is 303-575-6473.

Mark,

I know that we recently finalized the Houston product description for the Tanker Freight Swap.  Please see attachment at the end of this e-mail about Singapore's description.

Ultimately, we would like to have a global product description for EnronOnline.  I don't know if Houston is the ""final"" say but if we could get Houston, London, and Singapore (and possibly any future Enron location) to have all the same standard production description for Tanker Freight Swaps, then it would greatly help Enron in marketing these products.  The factors that would change been product description would be: 
size of ship, route, exchange (pricing index), and term.

If you could please talk with Robert Quick (London) and Debbie Nicholls/Paul Henking (Singapore), then maybe all three locations can agree to some kind of standard.

Matt/Robert,

I understand that there seems to be a delay in finalising the SG Tanker Freight Swap Index language as there are problems arising from possibly not covering the appropriate Worldscale flat rate for the Determination Period.  I have spoken to Scott Moncrief as to the the issues which seem to have arisen. 

I have attached new wording below, which should cover if the Worldscale flat rate changes at anytime so the latest applicable flat shall be taken for the relevant Determination Period especially if they trade a forward starting swap effective in the following year.

Please review as we would like to use the attached for all SG and UK Tanker Freight Swaps.  I have attached all relevant wording for all three porducts which may be traded OTC and EOL so our clients receive consistant confirms, rather than different variations.

Let me know your comments as we need to finalise this wording by Monday or lastest Tuesday to be able to post the long description into EOL.

Paul has suggested that Mark may want to meet up with some of the new lawyers in the legal department namely Ian Brungs, Paul Johnson, Jonathan Marsh (Compliance Officer), Sophie Martin, Sarah Sinclair, Peter Traung and Janet Wood.  Please can you check with Mark whether this is the case and if so, please contact me and we can fix up some time in their diaries.

According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).

Subject:	Limit Order Wash Trades

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

the ETP partnership interests to swapco, we will need to review the
partnership agreements (1) for required consents, etc. and (2) to schedule
the interests in the agreement.  Do you have copies of the appropriate
partnership agreements and, if not, do you know from whom we could get
them?  Thanks.

"RE: Itinerary","Thanks for the note.  I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.

Mark,

I am assuming that you are back from your London trip.

Was there success in the standardization of the Tanker Freight Swap product description?
Or was it agreed to keep the product description differentiated regionally?  
If global standardization has been implemented, has Carlos Alatorre been notified yet about any necessary changes?  

I am just checking to see where we are now to see what needs to be done next.

----- Forwarded by Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT on 06/07/2001 11:50 AM -----


	exchangeinfo@nymex.com 06/07/2001 12:20 PM 	   To: mark.taylor@enron.com  cc:   Subject: (01-191) EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES	



June 7, 2001
Notice No. 01-191

TO:
ALL NYMEX DIVISION MEMBERS
ALL NYMEX DIVISION CLEARING MEMBERS / MEMBER FIRMS

FROM:
NEAL WOLKOFF, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT

RE:
EXCHANGE TO SUBSTITUTE POSITION ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR POSITION LIMIT RULES

The board of directors of the New York Mercantile Exchange, Inc., has approved substituting position accountability requirements for the current position limits on all but the last three trading days of its crude oil, heating oil, unleaded gasoline, and natural gas contracts, beginning with the Friday, June 15, trading session.

For the last three days of trading in a particular delivery month, each of those contracts would continue to have a position limit of 1,000 lots.

The current net position limits levels will be reflected in the accountability levels. These are:

			Any one month	        All months
Crude oil		10,000			20,000
Unleaded gasoline	5,000			7,000
Heating oil		5,000			7,000
Natural gas		7,000			12,000



Any market participant with positions exceeding these levels may be contacted by the Exchange with inquiries regarding the participant's hedging requirements or financial condition. The Exchange would reserve the right to require that the position be reduced or capped.

There will no longer be any gross limits on the number of positions that can be held, as long as they are offset by positions on the opposite side of the market (example: a participant with 10,000 long positions in September, October, and November crude oil futures and 10,000 short positions for December and January would be considered to have a net position of 10,000 contracts).

These new rules are also intended to apply to the Brent crude oil futures contract, planned for launch this summer. The board has also approved a minimum reporting level of 100 lots for that contract.

These rules, which closely resemble those in place for metals traded on the COMEX Division, must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission prior to implementation.

Mark, 

Mike Fowler asked me to send you a note indicating tthat he wated to come by and see you about this contract.  As you may recall from our conversation last week, this is the agreement in which the counterparty absolutely refuses to give Enron any limitation of liability provisions.  I have asked the counterparty via email to reconsiderr this point about five times and the last request/email was not returned so I know they are not moving on this point.  Mark says it is up to you.   

The counterparty -- SNL --  did negotiate/give on some other points which otherwise but the contract into compliance with any other material policies/guidelines; so it is otherwise a good contract for us.  For more information on the counterparty, see the note from Sheila Glover below, check out SNL's website or I can discuss further with you.

SNL is an Informational Service targeted for analysis of the Financial Services Industry.  The information provides historical financial and current analysis for Financial Services companies.  SNL is the only comprehensive provider of this information that we are aware of.  Financial Trading is trading a portfolio for Financial Services and requires a relevant research tool.

FACTSET is currently used.  However, FACTSET does not have the company coverage nor does it analyze financial services companies in a relevant way.  FACTSET is slanted more toward industrial firms.  

The agreement is a subscription to the database for a one year term, requiring positive renewal.  The initial year term is $15,000 a year and the second year is capped at a 10% increase.

We do not use this service at the current time.

We have had discussions involving Tom Moran in credit, but I don't know if they have done a formal review. The initiative with AA came through Sarah-joy Hunter in the businesss development group, through soem cross corporate initiatives. AA would not allow us to bid on business because we are not an 'A' rated company, but given some of the other issues they felt they would allow us to come in. Tom said they are BBB-, so I know he has done some preliminary work. I'll bounce it off him and get you an answer asap.

Craig,
 
As we  discussed on Thursday, LG&E is preparing to enter into a hedge plan.
 
LG&E's hedge  plan is based on the use of call options.  The Public Service  Commission is expected to act on that proposal in the next few  days.
 
Chris Balmer, Pam  Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LG&E's  hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you  may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters.  We believe it  will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at  this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the  program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn  around times.
 
Attached are two  documents which will be the basis of that discussion.  The first is a draft  Bid Letter and the second is the General Terms and Conditions under which the  call options will be purchased.
 
Please review the  attachment and pass them along to whomever may need to be involved at your  company.
 
Thanks

       February/March 2001 Issue  Enron Unveils Storage Trades Enron Broadband has completed a series of deals in the data storage market, commoditising this fast-growing area for the first time. It acted as a market maker, purchasing storage capacity from StorageNetworks - which was then sold on to Best Buy, a retailer of electronics products. Crucially, both contracts were based on Enron's standard contract and included firm delivery with liquidated damages.  In the last few years the storage market has moved from being a self-managed and owned business to one where storage is served up from a standard metro network. Enron's involvement will be bring flexibility of contract offering and imbedded optionality, according to Ravi Thuraisingham, a senior trader at Enron. ""When we sell the product to the customer we remain in the market to buy the capacity back should they wish to unwind their position later. That is unprecedented,"" says Thuraisingham.   The storage market has historically been more flexible and more committed to firm delivery than the bandwidth market, but these trades mark a significant development. Rather than dated damages the storage market has tended to favour discounts on future purchases. ""There is a premium in the price for firm delivery,"" says Thuraisingham.  He says that a number of other market participants are eager to commit to Enron as a market maker. In addition, equipment vendors are excited by the possibilities of the market. ""most storage equipment at the moment is supplied to the enterprise market. This development opens up the wholesale storage capacity market,"" says Thuraisingham.

   Applications


   We  are  in  the  process  of  preparing applications for position limit
   exemptions  for  ENA's  NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These
   applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees,
   owners,  or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial
   interest  in any related commodity future(s) account either individually
   or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

   Please   direct   any   responses  to  my  paralegal,  Tana  Jones,  via
   intercompany  email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business
   on  June  15,  2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a
   financial  interest  in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA
   or other trading affiliate account).

   IF  YOU  DO  NOT  HAVE  A  COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO
   RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.

"Shore to Ship Communications","In case you need to tell people how to reach you on the boat:

The ship's phone number is 323-208-910 or 920.  The fax is 323-208-924 or 911.
These numbers must be preceded by the correct ""Ocean Code.""
From 9/4 to 9/6 the full number to dial is 011-874-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic West code).
From 9/7 to 9/9 it will be 011-871-323-208-910 (using the Atlantic East code).
I'm told that if you dial the wrong code you'll get a recording telling you which code to use.

It is also possible to call person-to-person by calling the local operator and asking for the INMARSAT operator.  You will need to give the INMARSAT operator the name of the ship, the guest's name and the closest land position.

Apparently it will also be possible to send and receive e-mails but the procedure remains unclear.

"QE2","I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).  I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).  My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr. suites for us at ""41"" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night (2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?

Is there a standard form of a short form financial master that has already been fully reviewed by the company and that would be ready and proper for EES to use?  Thanks.  MDS

Hello Suzanne,

I received a message stating that Mark Taylor would prefer that the NatWest
ISDA Master Agreement survive.  We agree.  Enclosed please find a revised
Assignment Agreement for your perusal.  Please note that the novation is
scheduled for October 26, 2001, therefore time is of the essence.  Should
you have any questions, feel free to contact me.  My contact details are
listed below.

"RE: phone numbers","If you really think you'll need to get in touch while I'm overseas you can try my international cell phone #  44-7881-512-535 which is a London phone number but works throughout Europe and North America.  And of course when all else fails you can always try to page me at (877)855-2081 or send an e-mail to my pager at 8778552081@pagenetmessage.net.  But the bottom line is that there is a large percentage of the time that I'm just plain unreachable since I turn them all off and let the machines do the answering -- which may not impress Joe but in my book is even more impressive than having lots of numbers.

Subject:	GET RICH ON $6.00 !!!



GET RICH ON $6.00


We have all heard of the get rich quick, right? Well, I am taking a chance,
I do know one of the people and
they have received about $600 so far..  She also said that it is the
easiest money she has ever made. So, lets give it a try! You have lost
a lot more than this at the park..

PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY
$6.00 CAN GET YOU THOUSANDS IN JUST A FEW MONTHS!


This method works in a very short time. The cost is only $6.00!
This is the 16th day since I started receiving $ cash, and so
far I have received $5,845 (in $1 Bills)...so I guess this is really
working already! Give it a try! All I did was follow the
instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent out
some e-mail to people that responded to my ads.

Here is a testimony from one of the thousands that have
benefited from this get-rich-quick plan:


""I'm a retired attorney, and about a year ago a man came to me
with a letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before
you now. He asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told
him that I would review it and get back to him. When I first read
the letter, I thought it was some off the wall idea to make money.
 A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue. I told
him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100% legal.
I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will
be all right. I was curious about the letter, so he told me how
it worked. I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against
participating.

Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to his
results.

About two months later he called me to tell me that he had
received more than $800,000.00 in cash!! I didn't believe him so
he asked me to try the plan and see for myself.""

""I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was
not much to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and mailed
out 200 letters. Sure enough the money started coming in! It
came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more
than I could open in a day. After three months the money stopped
coming. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it
totaled $868,439.00. I earn a good living as an attorney, but as
anyone in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of
stress that comes with the territory. I decided if things worked
out, I would retire from practice and play golf. This time I
sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had totaled
$2,344,178.00.""

""I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works.
He told me that there were a few similar letters going around.
What made this one different is the fact that there were six
names on the letter, not three like most others. That fact alone
resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave
him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no
one wants to risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are
curious about what little changes I told him to make. Well if
you send a letter like this one out, to be legal, you must sell
something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that
anyone sending a dollar must receive something in RETURN. So
when you send a dollar to each of the six names on the list, you
must include a slip of paper saying, ""Please add me to your
mailing list"" and include your name, mailing address and e-mail
address.

This is the key to the program. The item you will receive for
your dollar sent, is THIS letter and the right to earn
thousands.""


Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three
months you should receive MORE THAN $800,000.00 IN COLD HARD
CASH!


1) IMMEDIATELY send ONE DOLLAR [$1.00 US$] to each of the six
people listed below. THE SOONER YOU SEND THE ""$1.00 LETTERS"" THE
SOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN! Wrap the dollar (in order
to prevent thievery) in a note saying ""PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR
MAILING LIST"". Include YOUR NAME, MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL
ADDRESS.

**REMEMBER, if you don't ask for the service, USE OF THIS
LETTER WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU.

*****PLEASE make sure you have used the correct postage and
include a return address! This is VERY IMPORTANT!


2) Send an e-mail to each of the names above with ""$1 SENT"" in
the subject line. Write your name and mailing address. This is
important as it would inform them as to how many people had
joined the program under them.
Likewise, it will give them the estimate of how many one-dollar
bills they should receive.


3) REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to #1 at the TOP of the list
and move the rest of the names UP one position. Then place YOUR
name in the #6 spot.

This is best done by saving this to a file, then enter in your
information on line #6. Be careful when you type the addresses.
Don't forget to PROOFREAD them. Make SURE that the names and
addresses are correct. Also include your e-mail address.


4) When you have COMPLETED the above instructions, you have
several options on how you market the letter - through the
Postal Service, through E-mail to at least 200 people, IF YOU HAVE AN
FFA PAGE THAT WILL BE EASY, or through posting in ""FREE CLASSIFIED
ADS"" and ""NEWSGROUPS"" ON THE INTERNET, or through whatever
 way you deem is legal.

This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above
as long as you follow the instructions, because you are
purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list.
You can also use a Mass e-mail Network to mail it out in large
volumes for you. We highly recommend this one. They always e-
mail more than the amount you purchase, and their addresses are
always fresh. Posting Free Classified Ads on the Internet can
achieve good results. Simply go to a search engine, Yahoo, Hot
Bot, Lycos or any other, and type in Free Classified Ads. You
will get a list of over 190,000 sites for you to start post ads.
Use a catchy title such as FREE MONEY, and post your e-mail
address. When people inquire, simply send them a copy of this
letter by e-mail. The more you send out, the more YOU will make.
We strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family,
friends, and relatives as well.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL. (Refer to title 18, section
1302 & 1341 of the US Postal and Lottery Laws), or check it out
with the US Post Office @1-800-725-2161.


**Assume for example you get a 8% return rate.

1) When you mail out 200 letters, ONLY 16 people send you $1.00

2) Those 16 people mail out 200 letters, (3200 letters) and ONLY
256 people send you $1.00

I have copies of EOL due diligence for HK and Singapore (although this is very brief).  For Japan and Australia, this would have been done locally, so please contact David Minns (Australia) and Jane McBride (Japan)

In terms of full (i.e.offline) due diligence, this would have been carried out by the braodband team (James Vickerman) - and he should be able to deal with your questions concerning additional legal issues.

In regard to the online due diligence that was done for the European EBS launch back in March/April - would you have any copies of documents for the following countries:

Japan
Australia
Hong Kong
Singapore

If so, could you please forward them to me?  Choon-Boon Heng out in Houston is interested in reading them for his new product type launch for Asian physical bandwidth coming up in the beginning of September.

If not, could you please advise whether there were any additional issues with online trading on top of off-line trading in regard to the above.  There will be point to points within these countries.

Thank you very much and have a lovely weekend!

"RE:  International Travel","I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

When we last met you were going to look at a couple of for things for me, these were:

1 - Who is the legally owner of all residual rights attaching to EOL intangible? and
2 - What documentation is need to introduce a buy in participant to the agreement and then draft such document.

Could you let me know the status of both these items.  FYI - the items are needed for the US tax return (which cannot be filed without them) which is being filed in the next week or so. Accordingly, we need to execute and send to US for inclusion before this deadline - ideally I would like to do early next week.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?

"FW: Request for Proposals - Financial Swaps","I have taken a quick look at the schedules attached and unfortunately they are not standard ISDA schedules and are not in a form to which we can agree.  We can provide ISDA documentation to you tomorrow which would be satisfactory from a legal perspective but it will not be exactly the form attached to their e-mail.  We will also need Credit's approval and they rarely approve ISDA masters without any credit provisions.  There is an existing ISDA between ENA and an entity called Entergy-Koch Trading, LP which we would be able to use from our side but I don't know if that would work for them.  (It's existence might speed the negotiation process for an ISDA since we could pretty much duplicate its terms [except for credit and the additional provisions we require for regulated utilities] for Entergy.)

We are currently getting prepared to trade ammonia and urea in Enron Global Markets.  We started the group within EGM - NGL's late July, and with the help of John Viverito, getting ourselves ready for the physical trade.  We would like to meet with you for a few minutes early next week, if possible, to discuss the financial contract, what we will need to get one prepared, etc.  Our goal is to be prepared to do both the physical and financial trading of fertilizer by the end of the year.

"Back home","I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home.

Two weeks ago, a member of the FRBNY legal staff asked to meet with AIG
staff to discuss AIG's present and proposed retail swap activities. I
responded that AIG does not now and has no plans to engage in that activity.
For that reason, I stated that it was premature to consider the need to
regulate an activity that does not now exist and that ought to be the
agencies response to Congress.

"NOx SIP CALL 2004 Balance","Trevor,

This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago. 

Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.

Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?

"Letters of Credit; Preference; Swap Transactions","Julia sent me a copy of your memo following up on one of the questions asked at the session earlier this week.  I would like to ask a follow-up question:

Do we lose the benefit of the special treatment under the bankruptcy code when we enter into cross-product (i.e. physical and financial products) netting and joint credit support arrangements.  If we agree with a counterparty to net all of our trading exposures under multiple agreements (swap agreements and gas, power, steel, coal, etc. trading agreements) to determine how much credit support should be posted and then only ask for a single LC that supports the whole shebang, do we lose this protection since arguably we are no longer just ""under a swap agreement?""

"RE: How are you ?","Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

Tell Don I said Hi.

Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal

I will forward you the link to the TOCOM website and keep you in the loop moving forward.  Who should I liase with I wonder though, you or someone else in your department?

Susan is helping on identifying which of the two legal entities we have here we should use.

Why would we need a new entity to take the membership?

Dear Paul,

We are planning to apply for membership of TOCOM to trade (as principal) in kerosene and gasoline and as a first step need to get a document from METI under the CEL 145-5.  We have a form of the METI document from TOCOM which Maggy will fax to you in the morning FYI.

Pls help us get the necessary document from METI ASAP.

We are thinking of setting up a new company to make this application and should be able to sort this out next week but in the meantime pls advise us exactly what we will need to give you to move the METI process forward.

I am not sure whether this will be realistic if we need to incorporate a new entity but at this stage we hope to be trading within 6 weeks.

If you need to call me in the morning pls do so on 0901 840 2094.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

       Broadband Networking News  Mark Holmes 03/27/2001  Enron Hits Back Quickly After Blockbuster Failure Houston-based energy and communications conglomerate Enron's Enron Broadband Services unit signed a deal with Electronics Boutique earlier this month to deliver video games on demand in a bid to boost content offerings to its broadband customers as part of its entertain-on-demand (EOD) service.  Under the terms of the March 19 deal, Electronics Boutique subsidiary EBWorld.com will stream leading games for rental to Enron 's broadband customers. The deal is a positive development for Enron after the collapse of a deal with Blockbuster, which the companies announced March 9, that would have given Enron exclusive rights to deliver movies for a video-on-demand service.   ""The exclusive relationship has not yielded the quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting new on-demand service,"" explains Kenneth D. Rice, president and CEO of Enron Broadband Services.  ""The Blockbuster announcement was disappointing, but I do think the technology and systems to be able to do that are virtually complete,"" notes James Yannello, a utilities equity analyst at UBS Warburg. ""I do think they will be able to potentially a deliver a variety of items to end-users. I would guess they need to do some more deals, driving traffic on [to] their systems. I think they can bounce back pretty quickly from the Blockbuster deal. I think the blow was more psychological and I would suggest it was used as an excuse for some others to lower some very aggressive price targets on the company, which is what they did.""  The failure of the Blockbuster deal was a blow for the company as the exclusive 20-year agreement could have given Enron significant upside in the content delivery business.   ""I don't see Blockbuster as being a broadband killer for Enron ,"" Bob Christensen, a utilities equity analyst at First Albany Corp., tells Broadband Networking News. ""I think they will probably [get] one or two anchor tenants before the year is out. I am optimistic.""  The deal with Electronics Boutique and the failure of the deal with Blockbuster emphasize the importance Enron is placing on securing content for its broadband network. Yet its main revenues from the telecom arena will continue to be derived from its bandwidth intermediation business, which uses pooling points to provide the physical interconnectivity between bandwidth buyers and sellers, allowing users to provide bandwidth on demand. This is Enron 's core telecom business.  The content deals, while important, are not being factored into most analysts' forecasts on the company.   ""I am confident that the content delivery business will be successful,"" says Ray Niles, a utilities equity analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ""The fact of the matter is they did get another deal. It was not as large as the Blockbuster deal, but they did get another one in there. We are not putting numbers in our model and our earnings forecast for content delivery. Whether it is very successful or not very successful, in our forecasts, we are not assuming any particular forecast for the content delivery business. I think bandwidth intermediation is their competitive advantage.""  ""The reality is that no one had any earnings (from Blockbuster) in the company projections for several years at best,"" Yannello adds. ""It was a big name and was portrayed to be the killer app. It is disappointing, but I do think they will be able to bounce back with other deals. I also think in an early sense this gaming announcement is probably the tip of the iceberg of what they will be able to bring in.""  Enron, which produced revenues of over $101 billion in 2000 from its various businesses, is still rated highly by analysts, despite the failure of the Blockbuster deal.   ""We have a $100 target price and a 'strong buy' rating,"" Yannello says. ""That assumes roughly $75 of value for their energy business and $25 of value for their broadband services division. I think given what has happened in the broader market in the telecom arena, and given that the Blockbuster deal has falling apart, I think we be will waiting a while before we expand that $25 telecom valuation.""

"Travel Schedule","I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.  

I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.

I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.

I'll be in touch.

In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home.

"RE: VMAC Transaction","I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.


Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

Subject:	VMAC Transaction 

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Subject:	referee question

A proposal has been brought forward regarding next season:
Do we want to have 3 refs at the game (ie, a referee and 2 linesmen)?
The cost would increase from $20 a game to $60ish a game.

Some teams have suggested that this is not necessary as this is in fact a recreational league.  I tend to agree.

Let me know your thoughts, and I will pass them on to the league.

"RE:","I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?

On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.

Mark,

I spoke to the postmaster and she stated that the
mailbox needs to be placed either to the side of the
gate or outside of the gate.  She said that the main
office does not like the fact that the postmasters
have a key to a residence.  I don't know whether you
have had the opportunity to speak with them yet.  If
so, please disregard.

Secondly, were you planning on having an electrician
come do any work on your house?  If so, I would like
to see if he/she can put a light in the bathroom as
well as electrical outlets.

I'll be awaiting your response.  Thanks!

Veronica

Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.

I am forwarding initial documents concerning an inventory finance transaction. 

Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a ""financing"" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. [Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.]If someone in your group should review, please advise.

Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise.

Please find attached first drafts of:

1 the Master Agreement;

3 the Agency Agreement.

For ease of review, I also attach:

1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 

2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical
metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and

 <<REVISED3.DOC>> 

3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 


Please note the following:

1. General

- I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
side letter. 
- To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
Agreement.
- These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
to their comments.

2. Master Agreement

- As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those
contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
- Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
Options on non-Business Days.
- I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in
some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
discussed.
- I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not
form part of this transaction.
- I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
(see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).

3. Forward Sale Agreement

- I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
Agency and the Master Agreements.
- The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
- I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default.

4. Agency Agreement

- As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
this agreement as distinct as possible.


I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
transaction.

Kind regards

"NOx OTR flow control","FYI . . .

Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA

>>
Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This 
would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 
for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state 
and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are 
pretty much in that range.

Chris, Mike & Mark,

I want to pass along my thanks to Enron's legal and credit staff for their substantial contribution in finalizing the transaction with Knauf.  Carol St. Clair, Tracy Ngo and Ed Sacks did a tremendous job developing a structure that made sense for all parties and finalizing an ISDA agreement in 3 working days - with a German based company no less.   Ed and Tracy quickly developed Credit terms and provided valuable input into the transaction structure.  Carol worked tirelessly developing and negotiating the ISDA with Knauf.  Additionally, she sought out counsel within Enron familiar with German law allowing us to ascertain the appropriate authority levels within Knauf to execute the ISDA.  It was the effort of these individuals that allowed this deal to happen.

I have extended my thanks and appreciation to them, but wanted to make you were aware of their contribution.

We booked a 3 year, fixed price swap in N.  California originating just under $1 MM.

Thanks,

Laird

Recently I have come into possession of copies of two (2) partially
executed documents between our companies, and I have been asked by my boss
to follow up to procure one (1) original of our Electronic Trading
Agreement and one (1) copy of our fully executed Password Application.

On January 3, 2000 our counsel, Elaine M. Walsh, both faxed and FedEx'd
three items to you--an EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement, Password
Application, and Customer Registration Form.  Again, if you would be so
kind as to forward one of the originals of the Trading Agreement and one
copy of the Password Application, I would greatly appreciate it.  If you
have, in fact, already returned an original to us way back when, I would be
grateful to receive a copy of this fully executed document.

Very many thanks.

"RE: Trades as ENA","I am surprised that the tax people would be ok with the suggested EOL fix.  My understanding was that if the assignment to ENA from ECTRIC happens automatically, that is equivalent -- for tax purposes -- to the UK trader binding ENA and results in bad tax consequences.

Mark, oh master of EOL - Please see the attached documents forwarded to us from London.  My assumption is that the trades by the hedge funds on EOL will have to be with ECTRIC because of the way EOL is set up.  Is this assumption correct or is there any way to trade UK gas, UK electricity, Brent and metals on EOL directly through ENA?  Thanks, as always, for your input.  Frank

Lara,

a summary of what we just discussed 

Hedge Funds wishing to trade with Enron both OTC and online for products not offered by ENA.

1. OTC transactions will be arranged by originators in the New York office and booked in the name of ENA, and then a transaction will be entered into between ENA and the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC) to transfer the economic position to the relevant Enron affiliate.

2. Online transactions - see Justin's mail below. The suggestion would be that the Hedge Fund does the trade on EOL with the relevant Enron affiliate (eg ECTRIC). The trade then gets novated from Enron affiliate to ENA. A transaction is then entered into between ENA and Enron affiliate to transfer the economic position. We'll need to work at documentation and process to make this as smooth as possible.

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to ""train"" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Subject:	FW: Trades as ENA

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	RE: Trades as ENA

I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

As we  discussed on Thursday, LG&E is preparing to enter into a hedge plan.
 
LG&E's hedge  plan is based on the use of call options.  The Public Service  Commission is expected to act on that proposal in the next few  days.
 
Chris Balmer, Pam  Jaynes, and I will be giving you a call on Tuesday to discuss LG&E's  hedging plan, seek your comments, and address any issues or concerns you  may have in advance of actually sending out the bid letters.  We believe it  will be useful to seek your input and answer any questions you may have at  this point, since once regulatory approval is received the time to implement the  program, seek bids, and consummate transactions will all have very short turn  around times.
 
Attached are two  documents which will be the basis of that discussion.  The first is a draft  Bid Letter and the second is the General Terms and Conditions under which the  call options will be purchased.
 
Please review the  attachment and pass them along to whomever may need to be involved at your  company.

I am making a couple of important changes in our process that you should be aware.

In the future, we will not be generally requiring legal opinions to be delivered with the Deemed Isdas (we may however require them on a case by case basis).  We will still require legal opinions with the Master Agreements.  Also, as you all know one of the problems to get from Mexican counterparties is the agent for service of process.  In the future we will be sending as part of our package the names, fees and form of contracts for three agents for service of process.  All the Mexican counterparties need to do is to choose one, sign the contract (it is normally one page by fax) and send it in.   Because this will expedite our counterparties getting agents for service of process, I will start to ask for such information both in the Deemed Isda and the Master.

Finally, I just contacted the confirm desk to ask them to, in the future, always inform me of any Deemed Isdas they get executed from mexican counterparties.  Like this I can know and let you know exactly who is signing these documents and who is not.  Ideally, we should get these back within a matter of two to three days.  If not we should at least attempt to start contacting the counterparties.

Just in case you are wondering why I am so concerned about the deemed Isda.  Before we have a Deemed Isda executed, if there is a problem, I will have to litigate in Mexico under Mexican law (ENA does not like this option).  Only after I get an executed Deemed Isda, I am out of Mexican courts and Mexican law.

let me know if you have any questions and or suggestions to optimize our process.

The above was duly authorized and will be implemented immediately.

"some info","Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

FERTILIZERS

It's time to manage your price risk.

[Spread 1]
Managing Price Risk
For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. 
 
Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business
Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.
Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. 
Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.
[Spread 2]
Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.

Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business

The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. 
Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.

SWAPS

Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. 
Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.
The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.
[Spread 4]

Swap: Producer example 

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.
[chart 1]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.
?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.
 
[Spread 5]

Swap: End-user example 

FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.
[chart 2]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.
?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.
?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.
 
[Spread 6]

CAPS & FLOORS

Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price ""insurance,"" i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.
With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.
[Spread 7]

Cap: End-User example

CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.
To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.
The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.
[chart 3]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:

?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.
?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.
?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.
?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.
?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.
 
[Spread 8]

Floor: Producer example

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.
To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).
[chart 4]
 

EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:

?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.
?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.
?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.
?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.
?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

Create Limit Order 
Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.
 
 
  _____  

  [m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression.
  [m2]This is the key! - we are changing our price, not showing their price.

Skadden was amazingly lucky.  We have so many people it seems impossible that we didn't have anyone in the blast.  A messenger who works for a messenger service was delivering a package for us and he is unaccounted for.  And in the case of family members, so far only one associate has reported a missing brother.   It is so amazing how lucky we were.

I have a paralegal who lives in the blast area - Claudia Hong - but she came to work early that day.  She can't get in her apartment so I am looking for temporary housing for her.  She is on Oscar's couch ( you met Oscar at the party) right now.  But I have to find something better.  Let me know if you know anyone in Manhattan who has an empty apt for a week or two.

"RE: Material Contract Review -- ASAP","Our derivatives trading documentation does not generally contain a change of ownership default or termination trigger.  Such provisions are included in all of our master agreements between Enron affiliates and may have been negotiated into a relatively small number of third-party agreements.  A merger by ENA or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of ENA might be a trigger but the analysis is more complex.

We have heard from many of you regarding the attached request.  This e-mail lets you know suggested recipients to date.  It also confirms that (i) the current goal is to ascertain whether a change of ownership of either Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp. will cause contract breaches, defaults or terminations resulting in material liabilities and (ii) the timetable is as soon as possible.  Preliminary responses early this week (subject to further review as necessary) would be most helpful.

Thanks again, NJD

To clarify, consider contracts to which Enron Corp., Enron North America Corp. or their subsidiaries are parties that contain provisions concerning a change of ownership/control of Enron Corp. or Enron North America Corp.  At this point, we are considering material contracts, or a group of similar or standard contracts that collectively are material, or contracts the breach of which could result in material liability.

"RE: I'm in London","It looks like I'll be able to get back on Sunday.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) but of course all the flights were cancelled yesterday and today.  With luck they'll be back up to full schedules by Sunday when I have a reservation.  I'll let you know if that changes.  

It's interesting to hear what your reactions were since they very closely parallel my own.  I heard as I was coming back into the office after lunch on Tuesday and there was a small group standing around a computer screen watching an internet news feed.  My first reaction was that it had to be some kind of elaborate internet hoax and I still have a sense of disbelief.  I dread my next trip to New York when I will have to see the skyline with my own eyes.  Linda and Amanda are also stranded here and they tend to spend a lot of time watching the news.  After the first hour or so I just couldn't bear to watch and preferred to check in now and then for updates.  But then what else was there to do except sit and be stunned.  Even today it's still hard to concentrate on much of anything.  I guess in a sense I'm lucky that I have work matters to keep me busy.  Unfortunately, some are directly related to the tragedy.  There's no doubt the world changed on Tuesday and this will always be with us in some way.

All sorts of odd thoughts keep coming to mind.  I have wondered several times if Dad remembers when he and I went into one of the towers (it must have been when they were quite new) and tried to get to the top to see the view.  We were told there was no public observation area so we just took an elevator up as far as we could get and got out on a floor that was still under construction and went over to the windows to marvel at the view.  Remember the view from my apartment in New York?  And I was on the QE2 the last time it will ever go past those buildings (forgive the bad grammar but you know what I mean).

We're going to try and have as good a time as possible here.  I'm working during the days and joining Linda and Amanda for dinner in the evening.  Tomorrow we're going to see a West End musical.  Saturday we'll probably go to a couple of museums.  Hope you are keeping well.

Love, Mark

Subject:	I'm in London

Thank you for your e-mail and phone call!  We received both and were
really sorry not to be here when you called.  I guess we were both at
work.  When we were watching this tragedy on TV Tuesday, we couldn't
remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly
called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a
relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned
on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you
could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.

Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing
anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was
OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was
opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both
were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would
take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home
during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.
 It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek
Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the
river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were
emptying into hers.

Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his
flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas.
Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in
Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!

Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't
know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing
errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house
for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you
and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched
me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I
called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and
that you were in London.

At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.
 You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went
into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that
the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more
populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found
it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but
finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do
something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside
on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary
election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was
something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we
checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a
prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.

Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as
possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The
terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.

I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you
have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better
than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.
 I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish
something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston
these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the
Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for
communication difficulties and even ""bunkers"" or alternate offices in
place that they are now using.

This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope
they are up to it.

Please let us know when you finally get home.

Love, Mother

Just so you know ahead of time what some of my questions will be:

1.  I'm a little concerned about the safety of in-mast furling systems generally.  What happens if it jams in a blow?
2.  Are the heads both electric?  Will they operate manually if you lose power?
3.  The boat seems remarkably well equipped.  What sorts of additional items are usual to purchase before she's ready to cruise?
4.  How do U.S. owners deal with the voltage issues and electrical repairs and replacements?

"Limit Order Wash Trades","I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

"RE: E-commerce and steel","1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.

3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them.

Subject: E-commerce and steel


Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  

If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.

"ISDA European Energy Conference Agenda","Stacey,

Mark H. and I met this afternoon to discuss the December conference agenda and have the following suggestions:

1.  Review of California Energy Litigation -- (Mark H. would be good for this one.  If he can't make it, we can probably find a substitute.)
2.  German Energy Markets
3.  Convergence of Commodity Trading Forms

There were also a couple of topics included on the Houston agenda this year that might also be appropriate:

Christophe's panel discussion on new markets
E-commerce panel

I have also copied several of the lawyers in our London office who are active in the derivatives and commodity trading world to solicit their suggestions for appropriate topics to be added to the agenda.

"CFTC Issues","Using your numbers:
1.  No.  We won't do that until we think we have to.
2.  Not entirely, they have to meet certain more restrictive tests depending on how they are organized (i.e. how sophisticated are the investors).  A fund group like Fidelity that allows my Mom to invest has to have $1,000,000,000 in assets.  A true hedge fund that limits its investors to those meeting certain sophistication requirements only needs $100,000,000 in total assets.
3. Yes
4. Only if we become ""regulated.""  Currently we still maintain that we are a one-to-many site and are not yet subject to these rules.

OK - so based on this document:

1) Are we registered with the CFTC?
2) Are we prohibited from transacting with hedge funds (""investment company"")?
3) Are the ""exemption conditions"" with which the facility must comply just the conditions listed in the document?
4) Could you clarify: Do the conditions described in the document apply to us now, or only if we become ""regulated""?


As per our conversation, I understand that FX is subject to even less stringent requirements than our current commodities are.

Changes to Descriptions of US Physical Gas Products Delivered Within Texas 

Due to the recent sale of the Houston Pipe Line Company by Enron, which was effective June 1st 2001, the Product Long Descriptions of US Physical Gas products for which the Delivery Point is located in Texas have been amended.  Instead of ""Houston Pipe Line Company,"" your new counterparty for these transactions executed in the future will be ""Enron North America Corp.""

This change affects EnronOnline physical natural gas products delivered at Carthage, Exxon Katy and Waha locations. We have added the following language to the Product Long Descriptions of these affected products: 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions, if applicable, this Transaction is between Counterparty and Enron North America Corp.

This language will supersede the language in the first clause of your ""General Terms and Conditions"" (GTC) agreement, which presently states, ""In the event that the Delivery Point for a transaction is located in the state of Texas, ""Enron"" shall mean Houston Pipe Line Company.""

Please contact the EnronOnline Help Desk at (713) 853 HELP if you have any questions.

"RE: Enron North America Corp - Novation from NW to RBS","I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.  If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft. I'll let you know if it gets to that.  Otherwise I think we're under control.

Hi Mark,

Sorry that this is proving to be tougher than we thought to connect.

Jamie Wood at RBS asks below if all looks okay to you in terms of the Novations?

Is there anything I can do to help?

Many thanks,

see how he's getting on and whether there is any problems with the

I will keep trying but would appreciate your help.

Hi Suzanne,

Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the
actions
required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
documents which need to be executed are :-

1.  Novation Agreement

*       You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance
in
NY soon
*       This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW
books
into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
*       To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)

2.  Credit Support Annex

*       Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom
and
return via fax
*       As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need
to
novate the collateral as well.

3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp

*       To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS

4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement

*       See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement
letter.
*       This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names
have to
be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
distributed to your payments division.
*       Please sign and return by fax

Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter.

One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all
documents to
be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a
realistic
date for return.  Apologies for the rush.

	Futures Trading SEC Proposals Would Implement CFMA,  Altering BD Registration Requirements	


The Securities and Exchange Commission June 26 published proposed rules to implement parts of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000, including amendments to the SEC's broker-dealer registration requirements and Form BD (Release No. 34-4455, 6/20/01; 66 Fed. Reg. 34042, 6/26/01). 
Those amendments would implement CFMA Section 203, which allows futures commission merchants and introducing brokers that are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to register with the SEC as broker-dealers for the limited purpose of effecting transactions in certain security futures products. SEC registration in such cases would be accomplished by filing notice with the SEC. 
In addition, the SEC proposed a conditional exemption from registration under 1934 Securities Exchange Act Section 15(a). The proposed exemption would ""provide guidance on the extent to which a broker-dealer registered by notice may trade security futures products,"" the SEC said. It would allow a broker-dealer registered by notice to trade any security futures products as long as the broker-dealer did not become a member of a registered national securities exchange or national securities association. 
Finally, the commission proposed changes to Regulation S-P, which was adopted under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. ""These amendments would revise certain provisions of Regulation S-P in light of section 124 of the CFMA, which makes the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act applicable to activity regulated by the CFTC."" These amendments would permit futures commission merchants and introducing brokers registered by notice with the SEC as broker-dealers to comply with Regulation S-P by adhering to the CFTC's financial privacy rules, the SEC said. 
Comments are due by July 26, 2001, and should refer to File No. S7-13-01.

There is a lot of flexibility in setting the rules -- reserve prices or not, sale commitment or not, timing, etc. -- and you would have the added benefit of finding out where customers were willing to transact if our price was too high for them.

Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.  

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?

Steve

Armed with a target list of purchasers, we can craft the new product pop-up to hit those companies' systems when they log on, which would give them the following information:

General description of the assets
Contact information (names & numbers)
Directions on re-filtering for the Turbine Product (which would be housed under US Power and accessible only to those pre-approved companies)

The Long Description would essentially be the turbines' Spec Sheet.  But if a counterparty clicks on the Offer, we could replace the GTC's with a Term Sheet or LOI which binds the counterparty to 30 days of diligence with a break-up fee if the deal doesn't close.  If the company isn't willing to commit to that, the contact information will be their route to getting more information.

Thoughts?
Brad

Ah-ha!

The turbines idea on EOL.  I don't want to post an advetisement only I want them to post the turbines themselves.  So essentially just like a new product launch we would have a pop up announcing a new product and the new product would be our turbines - exactly the same as any other product.  They have to post the turbines out there and obviously there will only be an offer and they will be for the ABBs we actually have in Canada.  You never know someone may click - it would be an interesting concept and probably non-binding as there would be site inspections etc.

But not an advert - actually posting the turbines.

Bob Shults and I will be attending an eNYMEX reception this Thursday, and John and Greg are still trying to coordinate a meeting with Bo and Vincent.  Short answer-- we've got it as covered as possible for now.  

Another item:  I got a call from Stephen Thome in ENA who wanted us to post something like an advertisement for your turbines on EnronOnline.  Jay confirmed that it was technically feasible to craft a pop-up that targets certain customers with information and links to documents and spec sheets.  I'm told we have resisted this approach in the past because it has the potential to get out of hand once the genie gets out of the bottle, so to speak.  I think it fits well for the turbines, but I wanted to make sure you were behind this idea before we launched into development.

I would be happy to meet with them so feel free to set something up.  We have had contact in the past with NYMEX on some of these issues and I can explain the story later.

My asistant is Tina Spiller and I am in next week (I am in London this week) so maybe we can get together and discuss.

thanks.

Subject:	eNYMEX

I recently met Robert ""Bo"" Collins, the new President of the NYMEX and formerly with El Paso. Bo is keenly aware that the NYMEX has fallen down in two areas--first, catering too much to the locals, while ignoring their true customer base and secondly, not following through with the eNYMEX rollout. Bo along with Vincent Viola, the new Chairman of the NYMEX are dedicated to correcting these two problems immediately. Personally, I think there is a chance that EnronOnline could partner with the NYMEX and it could benefit both. Obviously, they need us far more than we need them, but there is a window of opportunity due to the recent change in the NYMEX management. Is this something of interest and if so, should we follow up? Bo and Vince will be in Houston in late August for a NYMEX cocktail party at ROCC and I could arrange a meeting at Enron.

"RE: EOL","Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis from a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the transactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake trades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is not blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We have been handling these by using a written termination rather than a reverse trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders have agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the confirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out of a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the original trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alternative we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's ""completed transactions"" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

We do have mistakes from time to time, as you suspected.  In almost all cases, the respective traders agree to cancel these by entering into a back to back offline trade.  None has been of sufficiemt gravity to be brought to my attention

STREET. VICTORIA ISLAND.
LAGOS.



BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


I am NURA USMAN, a management consultant in the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), I am a member of the Tenders Board a Committee in charge of Contract Awards and Payment Approvals (C A P A). I got your contact during my quest for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of Multinationals in the oil industry in favor of the (DPR) among which were;

1) The expansion of Pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and
downstream products distribution and subsequent evacuation. - USD$2 Billion.
2) Contract for Turn around Maintenance (TAM) at the various Refineries in the country.
3) The construction of Storage Tanks for Petroleum Product (Depots) -USD$94 Million.

The original value of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the tune of Thirty Six million, Five Hundred and sixty one thousand United States Dollars (USD$36,561,000.00) which has recently been approved and now ready to be transferred. However the companies that actually executed the aforementioned contract have been fully paid and the project officially commissioned.

Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening and/ or operating foreign accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed amongst ourselves to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for any incidental expenses during the course of this transaction, you will then be mandated to revert the balance 70% to us in due course, or as will be advised in due course.
You must however NOTE that this transaction is subject to the following
terms and conditions; Our conviction of your transparent honesty and
diligence, that you must accord this transaction with utmost confidentiality and secrecy.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the Ministry of
Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria and the Presidential Task Force on Contract Payment for the immediate remittance of the funds within 10 - 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is that the risk involved with your role shall be reduced to the barest minimal. To accord this transaction the legality it deserves, and for mutual security of the funds, the whole approval procedures shall be legally processed with your name or any company you may nominate as the bona fide beneficiary of the funds.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put in over 20 years of
meritorious service to my country, I am very much averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action as we are well behind
schedule to enable us include this transfer in the Second quarter of the 2001 fiscal year contractual payments.

Do confirm your interest with a return email to usm2001ng@onebox.com

Thank You.

REGARDS,

NURA USMAN.

Mark,

After leaving your office yesterday I realized that Larry May also requested a change in the index language used for these Options/Straddles. He says that the current language does not accurately reflect how the index is calculated for Daily Options because it uses the word ""average"". Please see changes below which will apply to all the indexes used for these options/straddles. Let me know if this looks okay to you we would like to get these changes into the system as soon as possible.


Current:
The Index for a Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day. The Strike Price for a Determination Period shall be the South Louisiana - Henry Hub Index price in the ""Market Center Spot-Gas Prices"" section located in the first issue of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report published during such Determination Period.

Proposed:
The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading ""Daily Price Survey"" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day.

"RE: Financial Confirms","Regarding the need for the RMT confirms, I have always thought this was really a tax issue and that for audit purposes they were needed.  If that is not the case, I don't object to doing away with them altogether.

We have approved doing away with confirms for EOL trades on a counterparty by counterparty basis.  We haven't actually gotten there with anyone yet, having just started the actual discussions this week.  Our plan was to negotiate an written agreement with each affected counterparty to amend the master agreements where appropriate.  Initially we are only working on physical power, physical natural gas and derivatives transactions (other than weather).  The idea is that a lawyer from each affected group would be involved to insure that all of the bases are properly covered.  This will obviously be a very time-consuming and laborious process.  The initial list of 10 or 15 counterparties to approach was selected by the back office people.  Our conclusion that this was even possible was based only on Texas and New York law analysis.  If any Canadian deals are at issue, we will need to get you involved both for the analysis and the negotiations.

Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if it makes sense to you.

Mark

P.S. -- Please be careful when sending e-mails to me.  There are two Mark Taylors and we're hard to tell apart.  The other guy has his middle initial (""A"") in some of the lists and sometimes there is a globe next to his name, but not mine.  My name usually has my phone number next to it.  We're trying to get the IT people to do something to better distinguish us.

Subject:	Financial Confirms

Mark, I wanted to track down two procedural matters with you respecting financial confirms:

1.	Currently we generate approximately 40-50 confirmations each day between ECC and ENA/RMT, which creates some significant administrative and filing burdens.  I am generally aware, but not precisely clear on the details, that there has been a recent decision that for certain counterparties, or at least with respect to EOL transactions, that Confirms are no longer necessary.  If in fact this is the case, can we do away with the formal confirmation procedures between ECC and ENA/RMT where there is not likely to be any dispute.  [Morris/Laura, if we do away with the formal confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT, and provided that we have a TAGG or Sitara Deal Ticket, is there any ancillary tax purpose for generating confirms between ECC and ENA/RMT?]

2.	In the same vein, for certain non-inter-company financial transactions completed on EOL, I understand that it has been approved not to send Confirms.  Again, Mark can you please clarify this policy for me, including how we determine for which counterparties this ought to apply in Canada.  It was my (again general) understanding that it may have depended upon the wording of the Master Agreement with the counterparty and/or the volume of  transactions executed with the counterparty.

Please let me know.

Regards,

"RE: Enron/Barclays Global Markets Inventory Financing","Joel --

I've taken a quick look at these and think that they are really more in the physical trading line than derivatives.  I'm trying to figure out who the physical metals trading lawyer is to take a look at them for you.

I am forwarding initial documents concerning an inventory finance transaction. 

Mark, I am distributing to your attention since the structure involves the buying/selling of inventory in a trading arrangement, and the documents are in some respects derived from an ISDA format. While this is a ""financing"" with a bank, and hence my involvement, there are trading aspects here as well. [Mike Robison is reviewing from the EWS business unit perspective.]If someone in your group should review, please advise.

Justin, I am distributing to your attention, since the choice of law is English, and you were involved in the prior Metals transaction that this is derived from. If someone else in London should review, please advise.

Please find attached first drafts of:

1 the Master Agreement;
2 the Forward Sale Agreement; and
3 the Agency Agreement.

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>>  <<010702_Forward_Sale_Agreemnt_DES.doc>>  
<<010702_DES_EnronAgencyAgreement.doc>> 


For ease of review, I also attach:

1 the Master Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<00300601_EnronCorp_DES.doc>> 

2 the Forward Sale Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical
metal Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001); and

 <<REVISED3.DOC>> 

3 the Agency Agreement marked up to show changes against the physical metal
Master Agreement (as last amended on 21 May 2001);

 <<PhysMstrvAgency.doc>> 


Please note the following:

1. General

- I have drafted the agency and forward sale aspects previously contained in
the physical metal Master Agreement in separate agreements. In order to
ensure that these agreements are as distinct as possible, certain elements
of the physical metal Master Agreement (for example, conditionality of
Transactions/Call Options on hedging) may have to be included in a separate
side letter. 
- To the extent that I have insufficient details in relation to this
transaction, I have retained the structure of the physical metal Master
Agreement.
- These drafts have not been reviewed by Enron and therefore remain subject
to their comments.

2. Master Agreement

- As the Commodities will not be exchange traded, I have introduced the
concepts of ""Reference Price"" and ""Pricing Date"", which are similar to those
contained in the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions.
- Enron would like to be able to enter into Transactions/exercise Call
Options on non-Business Days.
- I have, where possible, avoided referring to the Agency Agreement and the
Forward Sale Agreement. However, one aspect of the Agency Agreement that
does remain in the Master Agreement is that of ""Agency Costs"", which is, in
some instances, an intrinsic element of pricing. This will need to be
discussed.
- I have removed the concept of ""Minimum Value"", which I understand will not
form part of this transaction.
- I understand that, due to the nature of the Commodities, there may be an
imbalance in the quantity sold and that delivered. Although the consequences
of this need to be discussed, I have introduced provisions to cater for this
(see Clauses 4.3 and 5.5.5).

3. Forward Sale Agreement

- I have attempted to make this agreement as distinct as possible from the
Agency and the Master Agreements.
- The pricing of the forwards needs to be discussed.
- I have removed ""Credit Support Default"" as an Event of Default.

4. Agency Agreement

- As with the Master and Forward Sale Agreements, I have attempted to make
this agreement as distinct as possible.


I look forward to discussing your comments and working with you on this
transaction.

Kind regards
Deepak

"Re: Margin Calls - Financial","Peter -

We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because of the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible waiver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or handled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem.

	Peter Keohane 05/31/2001 11:54 AM 	   To: Mark Taylor/HOU/ECT@ECT  cc: William S Bradford/Enron@EnronXGate, Russell Diamond/Enron@EnronXGate  Subject: Margin Calls - Financial	


Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timing, notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using may have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is not a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no substantive concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in commodity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circumstances where their credit is getting ""tight"", I can see the lack of contractual compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group develop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under the Enron form, the ""industrial"" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter.

Attention:  Kathy Moore

Kathy, thanks for your help.

The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
Cinergy and PJM West.

We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
(at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.

As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
retail customers.

By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
December 3rd.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Thanks again for your help.

Subject: E-commerce and steel


Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Subject:	RE: EnronOnline Customer Lists

Mark,

Thank you very much for your e-mail I requested.  As it turns out I did not need it for Brad.

Brad did ask me to follow up on two items -- 

Item 1)  Brad was interested if we could share a list of people who visited the site.  So the users would obviously be a subset of this list.  Any thoughts on this matter?  If the customer visits would not work then --

Item 2)  Brad is interested in a workaround.  I shared the idea (at a high level) of a campaign to persuade the users to grant us permission to use their names. Brad wanted to be sure that several points would be addressed with whatever the workaround was.  His concerns are as follows: 1) we want to be as unobtrusive to the EOL customers as possible, 2) in any transaction we need to give the customer value, and 3)  the EOL customers would need to know how we would use the information if they did grant permission to share their data.

Suggested Action:

I would like to meet with you to talk further about any workarounds you might suggest which would address these issues.  After I have a clear understanding of your workaround which addresses the above issues I can then run it by Brad for his approval and then figure out who best to implement.

In this regards do you think we could meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. (in your office) for 30 minutes to discuss?  If this time is not convenient for you please counter with some times that are convenient to you.

Thank you 

Jake

1.	Generally, I would like to know your status of your memo outlining the scope of the regulatory requirements for our trading business, if any; and

2.	Specifically, and more urgently, but somewhat related to this matter, we have a specific issue which relates to a new product we are offering on Enron OnLine and potential regulatory implications for Enron OnLine and our arrangement with NGX, whereby Alberta fixed price natural gas transactions completed on Enron OnLine are included with NGX to establish the Alberta Gas Price Index.

Would you kindly give me a call at your earliest convenience?  As I say, I would like to get an update on the matter generally, but more urgently, we would like your advice in connection with this new specific product offering.

"RE: Increase in Demand for Brokerage Agreements","Sara:

How much protection do the agreements give us?  I have always assumed that they were primarily for the benefit of the brokers.  Of course, in the U.S. they are probably required by the SEC and in a country where they are not required you have to wonder how well the brokers are being policed by regulators.  I guess it makes sense to at least contact local counsel to find out what protections there are for the customer and whether or not it would be reasonable to ask for something in writing.  I don't think we need written opinions of counsel.  It might also make sense to explain to the business folks that we think there is incrementally greater legal risk in using those arrangements and that while they may be permitted to use them they should keep activities to a minimum where there is a more secure alternative.

Sorry for rambling.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the ""custom"" in countries not requiring an executed ""executing brokerage agreement""?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

Dear Friend and Future Millionaire,
My wife received this e-mail and forwarded it to me to review. We've both
read completely through it and have been in contact with some of the
individuals listed below.
We think it's an excellent opportunity that is well worth the small
investment of time and money, and believe that you will, too! CRH

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for
an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below,
to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether
or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25
out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for
the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks,
with money still coming in.""
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is another testimonial:

""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ...... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT
change anything.''

More testimonials later but first,
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======

If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and
comfortably, please read the following...
THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!

FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME
TRUE, GUARANTEED! INSTRUCTIONS:

Order all 5 reports shown on the list below

For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE
ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT
LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE
TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.

When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.
You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer
and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00.
Within a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from
these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be
accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them
from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in
case something happens to your computer.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to
each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is
instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on a
majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will
also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has
been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People have tried to
put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all
the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, and Do Not try to change
anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not
work for you.
Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and
REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has
made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune
2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.
3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.
4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.
5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2
6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. PLEASE MAKE
SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY!

 Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads
and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE ASTRO LEADS (360-358-3471)

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and
ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500, 000
e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails.

The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3....
$5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00


NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY !
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many
people will do just that, and more!

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method
# 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same
day service on all orders.
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.
=========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================
ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.
====================================================
Notes:
1) Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY only) for each Report.

____________________________________________________________
$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$

Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:

=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 3 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.
=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you
should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not,
continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.
=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU
CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the
cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER:
Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front
of a Different report.

There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !! !
======================================================
FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS
PROGRAM:
You have just received information that can give you
financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST
A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next
few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program
EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly
well as it is now.
Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put
your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ........... # 5
as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out
100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.
Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers
you will reach.
So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and
opportunity to become financially independent. IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !
============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================
""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was
on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days
she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I
have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
======================================================
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't
a better investment with a faster return and so big.""
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=======================================================
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact
to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks.""
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=======================================================
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet."".

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it ""reinserts"" the Schedule C with Credit information.

I am going to use my Auburn ticket this weekend.  I am also trying to find one for Kerry and an ID.  Any tickets?  Also, people may be calling you to sell a ticket for $10.  I e-mailed them off of Universitytools.com.    Last time I used Mindy's ID which may work again.

Did anybody use my Ark ticket?

Mike

Mark, per our conversations, please forward this to Kate Cole to show your approval.

Kate,

1.  Please create a new Entity Group in the Secretariat database called EWS - NETWORKS and update the database to reflect that the below-listed entities are in that group:

Clickpaper.com, L.L.C. *(TX)
CommodityLogic LLC
DealBench L.L.C. * (TX)
Enron Net Works Investments, L.L.C. *(TX)
Enron Net Works LLC *(TX)
EnronOnline, LLC
Acta Technology, Inc. (ECORP)
FinancialSettlementMatrix.com Inc. (Broadband)
ECOutlook.com, Inc. (EWS-ENA)
HoustonStreet Exchange, Inc. (EWS-ENA)

2.  Please make Tana Jones the Legal Asst on all of the entities listed above. 

3.  FYI - The bolded entites' LLC agreements are being amended (originals will be hand delivered on Monday) to allow for Mgrs (in order to be Manager managed as opposed to Member managed).  Embedded in these amended LLC agmts are the appointments of three Mgrs - Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley.

4.  FYI - Entities which have an asterik(*) are qualified in foreign jurisdictions and may, according to statute, need to file amended Certificates of Authority to reflect that they are now Manager managed.

5.  Also, to be delivered on Monday with the amended agreements is a consent of mgrs electing a standard slate to most of the entities listed above.

Thanks for your help in this regard.

Lisa -

Attached is a Data Services Agreement between EOL and CommodityLogic.  This agreement is intended to lay out the terms under which EOL will be providing the on-line transaction data to CommodityLogic for subsequent delivery to Enron customers.  I have not completed some of the technical aspects of the Schedules, but, rather, have left them to be determined by the appropriate EOL/CommodityLogic personnel.  I have also left the pricing blank as it was my understanding that this was being determined by Brad and Tom Gros.  This agreement is intended to go along with the waiver and consent document I previously provided.

Please look over the attached at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.  Please feel free to forward this to Savita or Brad as you deem applicable.

Thanks.

Please find attached the credit worksheet, with credit terms, for the proposed ISDA between ECC and Canadian Hunter Resources, by its managing partner Canadian Hunter Exploration Ltd.  We recently executed an EEI with this counterparty which was heavily negotiated and I would like the credit terms in this ISDA to mirror as closely as possible the agreed upon terms in the EEI.  Consequently, I am sending to you, via I/O mail, a copy of the cover sheet to the existing EEI for your reference and review.  Please call with questions or comments, and please put this on your **High** Priority List as we have a very short time frame for getting this ISDA completed and executed.
 


Thanks so much,

Brent,

Please review the attached suggested changes to the assignment agreement.  I have made changes to only one of the agreements, but I assume that any changes designated below will be made to both agreements.  Broadly speaking, my changes are designed to accomplish the following:

1.	We want to characterize the Chricicahua LLCs as ""Purchasers"" to the extent possible and not an assignor.  Much of the redefined terms seek to accomplish that objective.
2.	The stated intent of Chircahua is to ""invest"" in the Transactions.  This language tries to bolster our argument that Chiricahua is wanting to invest in the weather derivatives market but in so doing it is not acting as a market maker with customers in these instruments.

I have no changes to the Master Agreement and expect that we want to minimize any changes to the extent possible.  I am happy, however, that we are trying to execute separate masters and not simply amend ENA's existing master.

Subject:	Chiricahua Assignments

I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need to assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These two entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intended that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions directly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a term that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is that some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chiricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December and the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the process to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal in broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process please call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement, legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspective.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA trades to Chiricahua III and V entities.  

 << File: ChiricahauIIIAssignment11-19-01.doc >> 

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be entered into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These are based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be delivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolutions passed?



I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into between the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or the document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the document by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Chiricahua III


Chiricahua V


Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentation.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or process of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.

Regards,
Brent

Guess things really come full circle at Enron - it looks like we may be working together again.  I am working in the Global Finance Group in London and Bill Appleby and I are looking to do an oil prepay with RBC.  I understand that you are one of the attorneys who will work on this with us.  I have actually never worked through the prepay documentation, and was wondering if you could send over some standard prepay doc language.  Better yet, if you have the Alberta docs, could you please send those (I believe that this was the last prepay we did with RBC).  Also, could we get a copy of the master netting agreement with RBC. 

Thanks so much.

Look forward to working with you again!

Nicole

"RE: ISDA Documents","Thanks Chris.  I've taken a quick look at these and my reaction is (1) as to the definitions of specified transaction, we will probably not want to sign on to the expansive provision as an end-user, but it may make sense from the dealers' perspective and (2) we have needed exactly what is being proposed regarding the calculation of termination payments for some time and I view this as a major step forward.  Bottom line, I don't think we will be advocating the MFA position.

	Chris,

		Good to talk with you today.  Attached please find the end
user letters objecting to some of the proposed changes to the ISDA Master
Agreement.  As I mentioned, MFA, the UK Association of Corporate Treasurers,
the Committee for the Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA) and the
End Users of Derivatives Council (the old EUDA) have all sent letters to
ISDA saying that they have problems with some of the proposed changes.  We
met with ISDA once, back in March.  CIEBA and EUDC have both asked for
meetings with ISDA.  Not sure if there has been any meetings or whether they
are scheduled.

		Obviously we believe that the documents need to be fair to
end users.  We believe it is in ISDA's best interests to not go forward with
changes which end users object to.  Any assistance you can provide on this
point would be appreciated.

		 <<ISDA Package 4.2.01.doc>>  <<CIEBA.ISDALetter.doc>>
<<Dow.Jones.6.15.01.doc>>

		By the way, I don't have a copy of the EUDC letter, but the
Dow Jones article references it as being sent in May.

		Have a great 4th.  Hope the twins are sleeping well.  Please
let me know if we at MFA can be of any assistance to you.

		Pat

"RE: Brazilian Conference Call","Thanks Sami.  It might be a good idea to try and get the ISDA team to spend a little time on non-financial commodities.  It's not clear from this summary that they intend to raise energy commodity derivatives as an issue or attempt to achieve parity of legal treatment with bank products.  Just so you know, we have run into this kind of blind spot from local participants (who are mostly banks and investment firms) before but the New York ISDA staff is usually willing to help us out.

Subject:	RE: Brazilian Conference Call



Dear Sirs,

With regard to ISDA visit to Brazil and as discussed in our conference call
today, we would like to summarize the issues that we believe might be
important to raise with the Brazilian authorities as well as market
participants. We added some additional points as we realized might be
interesting to discuss:

I. ISDA Master Agreement and International Market Practice x Local Masters
and Brazilian Market Practices

a) Differences as to events of default, early termination, suspension of
contracts or valuations, etc. due to differences in market practices -
discussion of contrasts;

b) Definitions of events of default and early termination and reflex in
other local primary market agreements (loans, derivatives) - preparation
for trigger events of credit derivatives.

c) Should the master agreement be recognized by the authorities as an
official way to negotiate derivatives (ie. By creating a special regulatory
treatment, etc.) or should it be used voluntarily by market participants as
currently assumed?

II. ISDA Definitions of local rates, indexes, commodities, securities:
liquidity of local and international derivatives market referenced to
Brazilian financial instruments.

a) Contribution of ISDA to the negotiation of derivatives referenced to
Brazilian instruments.
b) Contribution of the authorities (ie. expansion of the scope to the
negotiation of international hedging derivatives by Brazilian banks and
counterparties).

III. Netting and Banking Credit Bills (c?dulas de cr?dito banc?rio).

a)   Instability of Provisional Measure x Contractual Reliability
     -    power of law x  weakness of legislative trust
     -    stability of contractual relations x change in law

b)   Negotiations of legislative approvals

c)            Independence of the Brazilian Central Bank and Monetary
Council

Parallel in other legislation x benefits to the market x constraints to the
market

IV. OTC Derivatives x Clearings

a)   Should all OTC Derivatives be registered in local clearances as the
authorities require ?

     -    pros and cos

b)   Tax effects and gambling characterization of unregistered contracts ?

V. Discussion of tax deviations that affect the derivatives industry.

a) Financial institutions: non-hedging transactions

b) Non-financial companies: hedging transactions

Feel free to contact us if you need any further explanations !

Keegan,

Samantha's hard drive crashed today, I'm having hardware look at it, but you might want to speak with Janette about ordering Samantha a new machine, she has an older compaq desktop that has had several major hardware failures over the last 6 months. Hardware can replace the hard drive but in order to save in time and productivity, a new machine might need to be considered. Let me know.

Subject:	ENRON ON LINE - PETROLEUM TANKER FREIGHT

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, particularly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in London, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States market. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any faith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here shortly.

When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a ""last done"" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.

Hi Mary - 

Guess things really come full circle at Enron - it looks like we may be working together again.  I am working in the Global Finance Group in London and Bill Appleby and I are looking to do an oil prepay with RBC.  I understand that you are one of the attorneys who will work on this with us.  I have actually never worked through the prepay documentation, and was wondering if you could send over some standard prepay doc language.  Better yet, if you have the Alberta docs, could you please send those (I believe that this was the last prepay we did with RBC).  Also, could we get a copy of the master netting agreement with RBC. 

Thanks so much.

Look forward to working with you again!

Nicole

"RE: Portland General Electric:  Order Rejecting Tariff Amendments","We do know which companies use the system.  I don't know if that information is stored in a searchable format but there is definitely a customer database that has profiles stored for each customer and determines what they have access to on the system.  My guess is that the only way to answer the question is for someone to sit down with the list of all customers and try and figure out which ones are utilities -- a less than perfect process but one that would give you a ballpark number.

FERC rejected the request by PGE to modify the Code of Conduct so that they could buy on EnronOnline.  Basically, FERC did not believe that buying thru EnronOnline was a guarantee that consumers in Oregon would not be harmed.  

FERC found that There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline                                     
     represent prevailing market prices.
          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
     is willing to buy at.

FERC left open the idea that PGE could re-file to fix the affiliate abuse.

As soon as we hear anything else, I'll let you know.

     Enron Power Marketing, Inc.                  Docket No. ER01-2103-000


ORDER REJECTING TARIFF AMENDMENTS WITHOUT           PREJUDICE

                           (Issued July 20, 2001)

          In this order we reject, without prejudice, proposed
     amendments of Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Portland
     General Electric (PGE) to their respective market-based rate
     tariffs that would allow them to make inter-affiliate sales using
     the EnronOnline trading platform.

     I.   Background

          On May 22, 2001, in separate filings, affiliates PGE in
     Docket No. ER01-2097-000 and EPMI in Docket No. ER01-2103-000
     (collectively Applicants) filed to amend their respective market-
     based rate schedules to allow for inter-affiliate sales through
     the EnronOnline trading platform, and to prohibit communication
     among affiliates regarding the contents of prices posted on
     EnronOnline or the times that PGE will be making trades on
                 1
     EnronOnline.   This amendment does not supplant the existing
     provisions of PGE's and EPMI's currently effective tariffs which
     allow for inter-affiliate sales subject to conditions that the
     Commission generally imposes on inter-affiliate sales where there
     are captive customers, e.g., allowing a public utility to sell to
     its affiliated power marketer only at a rate that is no lower
     than the rate it charges non-affiliates, requiring simultaneous
     offers to non-affiliates, or requiring use of a relevant,
     established index.  Rather, PGE and EPMI propose to amend their
     respective tariffs to add a provision by which they will make

               1
                The EnronOnline system is administered by Enron Networks,
          an Enron Corp. subsidiary.  EnronOnline is a free, Internet-
          based, transaction system which allows EPMI's customers to view
          real time prices from EPMI's traders and transact instantly
          online.  EnronOnline is not an EPMI application, but rather
          EnronOnline is a trading platform used as a tool by EPMI in
          buying from and selling power to third parties.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -2-
          and ER01-2103-000

     inter-affiliate sales via EnronOnline, with restrictions
     different than those in place but that, they state, will still
     prevent affiliate abuse.  Applicants state that the Commission's
     requirements have become outdated due to recent developments in
     electronic commerce and, in particular, the Commission's
     requirement that ""PGE post on its website notice of a potential
     purchase or sale with EPMI prior to PGE entering into the
     transaction with EPMI prohibits PGE from using EnronOnline, since
     EnronOnline offers only instantaneous transactions that do not
     provide for a waiting period before consummating the
                  2
     transaction.""   According to Applicants, this deprives PGE of the
     ability to buy or sell power ""from perhaps the largest marketer
                                                                3
     in its region, to the detriment of PGE and its ratepayers.""

     II.  Notice of Filing and Interventions/Protests

          Notices of the filings were published in the Federal
     Register, 66 Fed. Reg. 29,939 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2097-000),
     and 66 Fed. Reg. 30,180 (2001) (Docket No. ER01-2103-000), with
     motions to intervene and protests for both due on or before
     June 12, 2001.  None was filed.

     III. Discussion

          The Commission allows power marketers and their public
     utility affiliates to sell to one another at market-based rates
     when it can be assured that there is no possibility of affiliate
     abuse.  As the Commission has explained, affiliate abuse can
     occur when a traditional public utility with captive customers
     sells power at below-market prices to, or purchases power at
     above-market prices from, an affiliate without captive customers
     (such as a power marketer affiliate).  One way in which the
     Commission has sought to prevent this type of cross-subsidization
     by captive customers is to require the pricing of inter-affiliate
                                                             4
     sales at an established, relevant market price or index.
     Another way, when there is no assurance that the affiliates are
     transacting at the prevailing market price, is to adopt various
     conditions previously established by the Commission to prevent
                     5
     affiliate abuse.

          Here, Applicants request that the Commission permit them to
     use EnronOnline to make inter-affiliate sales, subject to the
     following restrictions that they contend provide sufficient
     protection against affiliate abuse.  PGE, when buying from EPMI
     using EnronOnline, will be required to ""take the transaction
     price as posted that is generally applicable at a particular
                                                              6
     location without attempting to negotiate any adjustment.""   In
                                                                  7
     addition, PGE will be prohibited from submitting Limit Orders  or
     engaging in any other type of transaction in which the identity
     of the counter-party is revealed to EPMI prior to the transaction
     being finalized.  Applicants also propose to amend their
     respective codes of conduct to preclude any communication
     regarding prices posted on EnronOnline.

          Applicants contend such restrictions ensure no affiliate
     abuse occurs since PGE will only be able to transact with EPMI at

          the public utility paid non-affiliates under certain standard

          public utility may sell power to its affiliated power marketer
          only at a rate that is no lower than the rate it charges non-
          affiliates; that the utility simultaneously offer through its

                In the case of a Limit Order on EnronOnline, EPMI would
          know the identity of the customer requesting a price higher or
          lower than that currently available.  Applications at 3.  While
          Applicants do not define ""Limit Order,"" the common understanding
          is that, unlike a market order, which instructs a broker to
          transact immediately at whatever price is currently available in
          the marketplace, a limit order instructs a broker to fill the
          order only if certain conditions are met.  Generally, a limit
          order may be either a day order, in which case it expires when
          the market closes if unfilled, or good-until-canceled, in which
          case the limit order lasts until executed or canceled.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -4-
          and ER01-2103-000

     the posted price (a price that is offered to all market
     participants) and there will be no transactions in which EPMI
     knows that PGE is the counter-party before the transaction is
     finalized.  Thus, Applicants contend that not only will PGE be
     unable to negotiate special terms with EPMI through EnronOnline,
     but EPMI will have no discretion to take actions which favor PGE.
     Applicants further offer that procedures are performed by
     computer and are not left to the discretion of any affiliate of
     PGE.  In addition, because the EnronOnline price is posted
     electronically and is available to all market participants,
     Applicants state that PGE's customers have the opportunity to
     transact with EPMI on EnronOnline on the same terms and
     conditions that are available to PGE.

          Applicants have failed to demonstrate that their proposed
     restrictions provide the same protections afforded under the
     Commission's affiliate abuse requirements and conditions (e.g.,
     protection against PGE buying too high or selling too low in its
                                           8
     transactions with its affiliate EPMI).   The thrust of
     Applicants' argument is that the Commission's affiliate abuse
     concerns are satisfied by using EnronOnline, a public medium, for
     selling power between affiliates.  We disagree.  While perhaps
     faster and easier to use than phone calls, faxes, or letters, an
     Internet-based platform is just another medium for trade, and
     speed and ease of use do not dictate that the Commission's
     affiliate abuse concerns have been satisfied.  There is, for
     example, no assurance that the posted prices on EnronOnline
                                        9
     represent prevailing market prices.

          Applicants contend that, since PGE can transact with EPMI
     via EnronOnline only at the posted price, there can be no
     affiliate abuse.  We are not certain, however, that the posted
     price necessarily represents the market price.  While, on the
     surface, Enron Online may bear some resemblance to an index or an
     auction, the posted prices for any product may not be the result
     of a competitive market of multiple buyers and sellers; in fact,
     for sales the posted prices represent what EPMI is willing to
     sell at, and for purchases the posted prices represent what EPMI
                          10
     is willing to buy at.    For other transactions through media
     other than EnronOnline, including other exchanges, EPMI might be

               8
                See supra notes 4-5 and accompanying text (citing cases
          that discuss Commission's underlying concerns with affiliate
          power sales).
               9
                See supra note 4 and accompanying text.
               10
                 All transaction on EnronOnline involve EPMI as a
          participant.  For sales, EPMI is the seller.  For purchases, EPMI
          is the buyer.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -5-
          and ER01-2103-000
                                                              11
     willing to sell at lower prices and buy at higher prices.
     Moreover, Applicants provide no information about how product
     prices posted by EPMI are determined, or whether there would be
     any restrictions on what products PGE could trade via
     EnronOnline, or even whether there are other similar, but non-
     affiliated, Internet-based venues where PGE can electronically
     trade those products to attain similar benefits.

          Having failed to convince us that these affiliates will be
     transacting at a prevailing market price via EnronOnline, we now
     turn to whether the Applicants have met other conditions
     established by the Commission to prevent affiliate abuse.
     Regarding transactions in which EPMI may be purchasing from PGE
     through EnronOnline, there is nothing in the Applicants' proposed
     restrictions that would require PGE to
     simultaneously offer to sell to non-affiliates at the same rate
     offered to the affiliate.  The Commission requires that, with
     respect to any power offered to its affiliate, PGE make the same
     offer to unaffiliated entities at the same time through its
     electronic bulletin board.  But it is unclear whether PGE can or
     will make the same offer to non-affiliates.

          Applicants also offer as a protection that PGE is prohibited
     from submitting Limit Orders, which would prevent EPMI from
     knowing that PGE is the counter-party to a transaction.  Again,
     this would not prevent EPMI from selling power to PGE at above-
     market prices.

          The Commission is not assured by the Applicants' proposal
     that transactions between PGE and EPMI conducted via EnronOnline
     will occur in a manner that is consistent with the Commission's
     expectations regarding transparent and reasonable prices for
     inter-affiliate power sales transactions.  There is, for example,
     no provision in the proposed amendments regarding how
     unaffiliated customers, or other interested parties, would
     monitor inter-affiliate transactions.

          For the above reasons, we will reject the proposed
     amendments, without prejudice to Applicants revising their
     proposal to address the Commission's concerns and incorporating
     appropriate restrictions to protect against affiliate abuse.







               11
                 Likewise, PGE might be willing to buy at lower prices and
          sell at higher prices.







          Docket Nos. ER01-2097-000 -6-
          and ER01-2103-000

     The Commission orders:

          Applicants' proposed tariff amendments are hereby rejected,

     without prejudice, as discussed in the body of this order.

     By the Commission.

After more than three decades of living in Ohio, I know how to be an
Ohioan.  While I was learning,
written guidelines would have been helpful. So I've written some to
assist others.

1.  Know the state casserole.  The state casserole consists of canned
green beans, Campbell's cream of
mushroom soup and dried onions. You can safely  take this casserole to
any social event and know that
you will be accepted.   In fact, Neil Armstrong almost took this
casserole to the moon in case
he encountered alien life there.  NASA nixed the plan out of concern
that the casserole would
overburden the Apollo rocket at liftoff.

2.  Get used to food festivals.  The Ohio General Assembly, in an effort
to  grow bigger offensive
linemen, passed legislation years ago requiring every  incorporated
community to have at least one
festival per year dedicated to  a  high-fat food.  Thus, Sugarcreek
honors Swiss cheese, Bucyrus  has a
bratwurst celebration and Gahanna, seeking an edge over other towns, has
recently introduced the
Triglyceride and Low-density Lipoprotein Festival.   It is your duty as
an Ohioan to attend these
festivals and at least buy an elephant ear.

3.  Know the geography.  Of Florida, I mean.  I've run into Ohioans who
couldn't tell you where Toledo
is but they know the exact distance from Fort Myers to Bonita Springs.
That's because all Ohioans go
to Florida in the winter.  Or plan to when they retire.  Or are related
to retired Ohioans who have a
place in Sarasota.  We consider Florida to be the Lower Peninsula of
Ohio.

4.  If you can't afford to spend the winter in Florida, use the state
excuse, which is that you stay here
because you like the change of seasons.  You'll  be lying, but that's
OK.  We've all done it.

5.  Speaking of Ohio weather, wear layers or die.  The thing to remember
about Ohio seasons is that
they can occur at anytime.  We have springlike days in January and
wintry weekends in October. April
is capable  of providing a sampling of all four seasons in a single
24-hour period. For these reasons,
Ohio is the Layering Capital of the World. Even layering, however, can
pose danger.  Golfers have been
known to dress for hypothermia  and end up dead of heat stroke because
they couldn't strip off their
layers of plaid fast enough on a changeable spring morning.

6.  Don's take Ohio place names literally.  Upper Sandusky is below
regular Sandusky.  Circleville is
square.  East Liverpool has no counterpart to the west.  Also, if a town
has the same name as a foreign
capital.....Lima or Berlin, for example......you must not pronounce it
that way lest you come under
suspicion as a spy.  Hence, it's not LEE-ma as in Peru, but LYE-ma as in
bean, and it's BER~lin, not
BerLIN, like in Germany.

7.  Become mulch literate.  Ohioans love mulch and appreciate its subtle
differences.  Learn the
difference between hardwood, cypress and pine bark at  a minimum.
Researchers think the state
affinity for mulch derives from its relatively flat terrain.  People
have a subconscious need for
topography,  and when it can't be supplied naturally, they are more
likely to make little mulch hillocks
in their front yards.

8.  In order to talk sports with obsessive fans in Ohio, you have to be
knowledgeable on three
levels-professional, college and high school. The truly expert Ohio
sports fan knows not only the name
of the hotshot quarterback at Abercrombie and Fitch High School, but
also what colleges he's
interested in, how much he bench-presses, who he took to the prom and
what he got on his biology quiz
last week.

9.  Remember that Ohioans are never the first to embrace trends. When we
do embrace them, we do so
with a Midwestern pragmatism. For example, if you see an Ohioan with a
nose ring, there's a good
chance he's had it undercoated  to guard against rust.

10.  The best way to sell something in Ohio is to attach the term
""Amish"" to  it.  The product need not
be genuinely Amish.  This would explain the existence of Amish moo shu
pork.

I hope you found this guide to be useful.  If it offends you, please let
me know and I will bring green
bean casserole to your home to make amends.

Subject:	Man Financial:  margin calculation 

ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was ""additional margin"".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

Albertson's, Inc., one of the largest food/drug retailers in the U.S., is looking for a new General Counsel. Albertson's have been a very good client for the firm over the past 10 years, and if we could place someone there it would probably enhance our relationship.

A description of the position and related matters is attached.

Please give me a call if you have any ideas.

They don't know exactly who the customers will be or what products will be offered but have several ideas concerning how to avoid the CEA pitfalls -- maybe even including seeking no-action relief from the CFTC.

"Job Postings","Kelly:

Thanks for getting back to me with your analysis.  Here's what I've done:

Not sure what the situation is with the Lead Expediter (95%) position -- the phone line of the manager for that one doesn't seem to be working and an e-mail to him was returned as undeliverable -- even though his name was in the company e-mail address book.  But he's in the same department as one of the jobs below (Sr. Purchasing Agent I think), and this position is a more junior slot, so you probably want to be considered for the more senior position first anyway.

The Senior Project Manager (80-90%) and Senior Purchasing Agent (80%) slots are still open.  I talked briefly to the managers listed on the postings and have forwarded your resume to them for consideration.  I have no feel for the timing on the Proj. Mgr. position and in fact the manager was a bit brusque, but the guy on the Purch. Agent job said the timing was great since he's taking a stack of resumes home with him this weekend to review.

I've left voice-mail messages concerning the Construction Engineer (90%) and Process/Mechanical Engineer II (80%) positions and will forward your resume if they are still looking.

 On the others, it might make sense to go ahead and go through the application process on the website.  Particularly for the one that says not to contact them directly -- there's no pointing in making them mad before they even see your resume!

I'll keep you posted on the others.  If there are no answers to my voicemails by the middle to end of next week, you might want to submit for those on the website, too.  At least then you know your resume is in the hopper.

I just went to order the pictures we had taken at the photographer's in
August.  They wouldn't let me order without the proofs.  They said there
are more numbers on the back of the proofs than we have.  Do you still
have the proofs?  I hope so, because they haven't come in the mail yet.
We would really appreciate it if you could send them as soon as possible.
 It takes four weeks to get the finished pictures after they are ordered
and we want to put some wallet sized copies in Christmas cards.  I hope
things have calmed down for you some at work.  I really hate to bother
you with this.

To:	US REGULATORY COMMITTEE
Subject:	Bankruptcy Reform Language - Section 562

Attached is the most recent Sec. 562 proposal responding to FDIC's concerns.


Modifications include:

a) incorporation of  burden of proof language into statute. This language
was originally refrenced only in the legislative history language.(i.e if
the timing of the measurement of damages is challenged by the trustee, the
burden of proving that the measurement of the date of
liquidation,termination, acceleration would not be commercially reasonable
... etc. lies with the swap participant .. master netting participant....

b) additional legislative history language strengthening non-application of
Section 562 to FDIA (562 has no impact on contracts/agreements othern than
those specified in the section)

c) additional langauge in legislative history explaining that the need to
measuring damages prior to date of termination/liquidation/acceleration is
rare but will occur in unusual circumstances (language cites the
disapperance of the Kuwaiti Dinar after the 1990 invasion.

Please call if you have any questions.  Many thanks!

Here is our proposal, based on yesterday's meeting (sorry you weren't
there).  We believe this is responsive to the concerns that were raised,
and hope that you agree.  I am circulating this to those at yesterday's
meeting for whom I have e-mail addresses;  I trust you will circulate to
others in the PWG.  Thanks Mike.


Sec. 562 - Timing of damage measurement in connection with [protected
contracts]

If the trustee rejects a [protected contract or agreement] or if [a
protected counterparty] liquidates, terminates, or accelerates such
contract or agreement, damages shall be measured as of the earlier of --

(1) the date of such rejection; or

(2) the date or dates of such liquidation, termination, or acceleration
unless:

     (A)  there are not any commercially reasonable determinants of value
as of such date or dates, in which case such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant shall measure damages as of the earliest subsequent
date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable determinants of
value; or

     (B) there are no determinants of value as of such date or dates, in
which case such forward contract merchant, stockbroker, financial
institution, securities clearing agency, repo participant, financial
participant, master netting agreement participant, or swap participant
shall measure damages as of the earliest date or dates after, or the latest
date or dates before, such date or dates on which there are commercially
reasonable determinants of value.

For the purposes of subsection (2), if damages are not measured as of the
date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration and the trustee
challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward contract
merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency,
repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
participant, or swap participant,  such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant has the burden of proving that there were no
commercially reasonable determinants of value or no determinants of value
as of such date or dates.


Legislative History:



Section 910 adds a new section 562 to the Bankruptcy Code providing that
damages under any swap agreement, securities contract, forward contract,
commodity contract, repurchase agreement or master netting agreement will
be calculated as of the earlier of (i) the date of rejection of such
agreement by a trustee or (ii) the date or dates of liquidation,
termination or acceleration of such contract or agreement.  Section 562
provides an exception to the rule in (ii) if there are no commercially
reasonable determinants of value as of such date or dates,  in which case
damages are to be measured as of the earliest subsequent date or dates
after such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
determinants of value, or if there are no determinants of value as of such
date or dates, in which case damages are to be measured as of the earliest
subsequent date or dates after such date or dates or the latest date or
dates before such date or dates on which there are commercially reasonable
determinants of value.  Although it is expected that in most circumstances
damages would be measured as of the date or dates of liquidation,
termination or acceleration, in certain unusual circumstances, such as
dysfunctional markets or liquidation of very large portfolios, there may be
no commercially reasonable determinants of value, and in other unusual
circumstances, such as war conditions, there may be no determinants of
value whatsoever.  Measuring damages as of a date or dates before the date
of liquidation, termination or acceleration will occur in very unusual
circumstances.  An example was the need to use the most recent available
information for the Kuwaiti Dinar after the virtual disappearance of the
currency after the invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

The non-bankrupt party is not given unlimited discretion to determine the
date as of which damages are to be measured.  Instead, its actions are
circumscribed unless there are no ""commercially reasonable"" determinants of
value (or no determinants of value whatsoever) for it to measure damages on
the date or dates of liquidation, termination or acceleration.  The
references to ""commercially reasonable"" are intended to reflect existing
state law standards relating to a creditor's actions in determining
damages.  New section 562 provides that if damages are not measured as of
the date or dates or liquidation, termination or acceleration and the
trustee challenges the timing of the measurement of damages by a forward
contract merchant, stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing
agency, repo participant, financial participant, master netting agreement
participant, or swap participant, such forward contract merchant,
stockbroker, financial institution, securities clearing agency, repo
participant, financial participant, master netting agreement participant,
or swap participant has the burden of proving the absence of any
commercially reasonable determinants of value or any determinants of value,
as the case may be.

New section 562 is not intended to have any impact on the determination
under the Bankruptcy Code of the timing of damages for contracts and
agreements other than those specified in section 562.  Also, section 562
does not apply to proceedings under the FDIA, and it is not intended that
Section 562 have any impact on the interpretation of the provisions of the
FDIA relating to timing of damages in respect of QFCs or other contracts.

"RE: Food","I definitely think Mark's is a best bet if we can get in on Saturday.  Lunch will probably depend on where we are - is there some place on the water near the boat show that takes lunch reservations?  Maybe we can go to the boat show early and finish up in time for lunch.  Unless you'd rather do something else on Sat. and go to the boat show Sunday -- any good Sunday brunch places?

please let me know if there is another restaurant you would like to have

My flight doesn't get in until 10:30 or so on Friday night.  Not sure
what we can still do for food at that hour.  Do people eat late in Ft.
Lauderdale?  In case you're still looking for food ideas, I found these
that looked interesting:


Bistro Mezzaluna
Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
Left Bank
Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)

Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the
airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last
two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and
see what you think.

I was just speaking with Jan Aspuru - Director of their Fuel Services Division - and he tells me that they have not been able to get their ISDA completed with Enron and therefore have been doing all their swaps business with MS and Goldman. He said they have a 10 year coal purchase agreement and buy natural gas from us, but the ISDA had gotten bogged down between legal teams. I don't know what the legal issue is and neither did he, but his attorneys told him that whatever language we wanted in (which our attys said was minor) his attys felt was a major change - plus neither MS nor Goldman required the same language. Since they don't need the change for them, they see no reason to agree to it with us.

Since I'm not familiar with your group, could you tell me who is handling this so Jan and I can understand the issue a little better? Thanks,

Al,
I think that Enron and PPL should replace all previous guaranties with
$30MM documents covering the ISDA, Master Power Agreement and any
additional physical gas business as well. Please let me know if the
dollar amount is agreeable.

You can participate by going to https://hrglobal.enron.com, and use your global id (begins with a 9, not the ""P"" number). You can also email or call Eric Thode and tell him what you want to do, and he can handle it for you.  It is possible to participate (i.e., access the site) but not make a contribution, if that is your preference. It will at least help our sagging participation percentage.

I have to admit that I thought I had participated in the contribution process before today, but learned that my effort to participate had failed.  Therefore, you may have also attempted to submit your contribution, but you are showing up as a non-participant at this point.  You will know you're contribution has been registered when you receive a confirming email.

I added the sentence on the fees to say something like at the request of or
directed by ERMT.  I think this works, because we should only owe fees to
the extent of services provided that we request - in the event we don't
request any, we shouldn't owe anything.

As far as the fee structure, I would think it would need to be cost or
cost-plus.  Obviously, cost-plus looks better from an arms-length basis.

Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.

Subject:	RE: hedge funds

Doug and Larry  -
I would say we're at least 6 weeks away from getting the first fund (Tudor) set up to transact gas, crude, products, etc. on EOL. 

The primary reason for this is the way Tudor - and most of these funds - are set up. Normally the funds have at least two separate entities, one onshore and one offshore, so that they can attract both US and overseas investors. 

We have separate ISDAs w/ each fund, yet in practice the fund manager will trade, say, 100 lots which is then split in some way between the two funds. While this works in practice right now, with the funds calling in and us executing orders, it would not work at present on EOL unless they traded as separate entities. Because one manager/trader usually trades on behalf of both entities, he would have to be clicking on two separate EOL screens to trade. 

When I spoke w/ Larry 2 weeks ago, he asked whether the funds could trade on EOL through only one of the two entities. I brought this up w/ them and the reply was that it's not possible. The reason is that the funds are set up legally according to certain guidelines, one of which is that trades are allocated among the various funds according to capital in each fund. To put all of one trade in one fund would violate those guidelines, as the manager would be favoring one class of investors - say, foreign ones if it were only the offshore fund that traded on EOL - over another by putting all of one trade in one fund. If the trade was a winner, the foreign investors would benefit more than domestic ones. If it's a loser, it would be the other way around.  

The way we're proceeding to work around this is to draft an a legal agreement that basically gives one entity (a ""superfund"") the ability to trade on EOL on behalf of all the funds with which we have ISDAs. We have spoken to the funds about this, as well as to Dan Diamond and Savita Puthigai from EOL, and all have agreed that this is the best way forward. 

There are two funds that we deal w/ which have only one entity, which would make transacting on EOL much easier. 

One of those - Harvard - already has transaction rights on EOL. Harvard, however, is not going to be a flow customer, which is why I noted above that Tudor is really the first fund that will transact regularly on EOL. Harvard's focus is longer term and typically more option-oriented. The one thing they might trade on a more frequent basis - as I mentioned to Larry - is the WTI/Brent spread. Other funds have expressed interest in seeing this product online as well.

The second fund we are still negotiating an ISDA with, but that should be signed within the next 2 weeks. 

As you can see, the funds are not all set up the same way. Moreover, many have different focuses - i.e. short-term, longer-term, fundamentally driven, technically-driven, etc. Some are also restricted by their charter from trading prompt-month instruments. Our goal is to get all of them set up on EnronOnline; but not all of them will be flow customers. 

All the funds currently have guest IDs on EOL. We worked an arrangement w/ Dave Forster and Mike Bridges of EOL under which the funds' guest accounts are good for 2-6 months. So the funds are seeing EOL prices, and we very often transact on those prices - at this point more on the gas side than crude. However, recent trades we have initiated on the crude/products side - for example, a Cal02 fuel oil crack - have been done b/c a fund has seen the price on EOL. Moreover, trades we pitch are often referenced to EOL prices, so that the funds can monitor them for their desired levels. 

Chris Glaas has visited many of the funds to pitch his EOL DFL product, which would allow them to more easily and transparently play in the Dated Brent market. So has Andy James, from the shipping group, who was pitching both dry bulk cargo and wet tanker route markets on EOL. When we last spoke, Larry introduced me to the TAS gasoline product. We're definitely interested in the new products that are out there, and are happy to talk to the funds about specific ones. 

As far as internal problems, the only one we have is the lack of adequate numbers of legal staff to draft and negotiate ISDAs and these EOL omnibus agreements w/ the funds. ENA/EGM has assigned one lawyer to us - Frank Sayre - and he is also saddled w/ other responsibilities so that his time is very constrained. 

Just to summarize, as far as status on EOL, all the funds except Harvard have guest IDs for EOL. We have signed ISDAs w/ five and are negotiating ISDAs w/ seven more. In addition, we are in discussion w/ two other funds. Three of the funds - one with which we're negotiating an ISDA and the two with which we're in discussion - are program (""black box"") funds. Our specific pitch to them was EOL, as it has more transparent pricing and often tighter spreads than they see on the floor. Of all the funds, these we expect would provide the most flow business to EOL. 

Sorry for the long explanation to a short request - if you have more questions I'd be happy to discuss them over the phone. I'm at 212 702 3914.  
Regards,
Russ

Subject:	ENRON ON LINE - PETROLEUM TANKER FREIGHT

In an effort to get the concept off the ground here in the States, particularly Houston, to that of equal extent presently being experienced in London, we need to come up with a marketing/educational assault on the States market. When attempted in the past, we found the concept was heavily resisted by die-hard crude traders and vessel owners. The biggest complaint, other than sheer stupidity on anything futures related, was that no one had any faith or could agree on a pricing index.  Fortunately, the market is starting to see some spurts in this direction overseas and can expect the same here shortly.
 
Below you will find the most widely accepted index known as The Baltic International Routes (BITR).

The Baltic Exchange would like to thank its panellilsts for their contributions.
Names of the panellists are available from the Baltic Exchange website (www.balticexchange.com) and in the manual for the panellists.


When reading the above chart, you will find the various voyages that are assessed daily by the Baltic Exchange.  This report comes out every day at 11:00 AM New York. While anyone in the biz can become a member of the exchange, the rates are assessed by a panel consisting of brokers ONLY; a total of 8 different brokerage firms that more or less look at the tanker market activity for the day and average what has been reported as done.  The tanker market, for the most part, is very transparent.  

1 in Norway
1 in France
1 in the U.S.
5 in London

As you can see, it is more popular in London.  This relates to the exact same concept that has been around for years as it pertains to the Dry freight market.

The market that we wish to begin concentrating on in Houston would be the T9 route -  70,000 MT loads Puerto La Cruz (P.L.C.) and discharges Corpus Christi - described as caribs to USG.

The flat rate (ws100) published by WorldScale (ws) for the year 2001 actual voyage P.L.C. to corpus is 5.10 p/mt.  As u can see by the last posting (May 11th) for route T9, the exchange is calling it a ws162 market ....If you did a deal whereby you called and sold the month of Mays average at ws190 and the market stayed at the 160's level you would be making 30 points on the 5.10 p/mt flat which = 1.53 p/mt x 70,000 mt cargo = 107,100 USD; vice versa if you bought at ws 190.

The initial attraction for Houston in this market is the same reason London trades T7 ( North Sea to Cont).  We have a trading department here that should have a solid understanding of the short haul crude oil markets as it pertains to their screen trades and to how it will effect freight.  In addition, we recently ourselves have had more activity in the short haul crude market particularly with 2 recent purchases of Columbian stems.

90% of the chartering for this market is done in the States and 75% of the international owners have commercial representation in the States.

Route T9 has the volatility to swing from ws 155 to ws 315 over a months time - contributing factors that effect market swings are the same as any market when broken down.  For example:

Supply/Demand Scenarios - assume there are 25 stems in a month and only 23 boats that can make the different dates, and if only 10 of those boats are acceptable by the majors (or anyone else that is worried about spill liability sanctions), combined with a herd mentality that trades on a ""last done"" philosophy combined with panic and weather delays particularly in EC Mexico where 10-day turnaround voyages can increase to 20 days.

70,000 MT of crude is more commonly known in shipping as the 500,000 bbl market.  Basic API gravity conversion for crude is 7.33 bbls p/mt hence 7.33 x 70,000 mt = 513,000 bbls.

This size vessel dominates the short haul crude market (caribs to usg) (where the refineries are) because they are the biggest boats you can get into most of the terminals due to physical restrictions such as draft, LOA, etc...  This not only enables the majors to get their crude right in, but allows the traders more flexibility to sell the cargos delivered to a wider range of buyers.  When the big boats (VLCC's) (very large crude carriers) (usually 2 million bbl plus boats) come to the USG from the Persian Gulf, West Africa, North Sea, etc.. they park off at Anchorage and then are lightered or off loaded to 70,000 mt boats to then bring the crude in.  (I apologize if this is remedial for any readers)  In any event, when the USG sees a surge in big ships coming west to the states, the 70,000 mt boats get sucked up by the lighterage companies enabling the short haul crude market boats to get tight which means rates will swing hard.  Currently it is a weak market at the 70 x ws 160 level.

On average there are approximately 30 physical cargos p/month for the caribs, or the T9 route.  For the most part the breakdown is as follows :

Mexico (Cayo Arcas, Pajaritos,) Mayan ,Isthmus, Olmeca crude - mainly dominated by shell who have the processing deal with the Mexicans where they deliver them cpp from the USG.  Citgo has a few, as does Valero who will probably have more with recent acquisition of Diamond Shamrock Refining, Orion, Coastal, Fina, Conoco, Koch, Chevron etc.  

Venezuela (Puerto la Cruz, Amuay, Puerto Miranda, la Salina, Bajo grande) etc. players are PDV, Lyondell, BP, Exxon/Mob, Conoco, Orion, Coastal etc..

Columbia -  same players

(We certainly have the resources here for more exact figures and breakdowns.)

Why would this work here in the States? With the recent surge in volatility, a lot of the above mentioned physical players have had their ass's handed to them.  Freight is becoming a more crucial part of crude oil trading.  Some of the bigger players have already put into place forms of hedges such as contact of affreightments (C.O.A.'s).  For example, Lyondell has a C.O..A. with 3 different owners to provide 2 ships per month (that totals 6 moves p/mo.) for 2 years.  The freight rates are settled off a 1 to 5 point formula off Mardata (Lloyds register) which they in turn can hedge with Online. 

Owners - who for the most part are always going to try to be bullish - if have an understanding of hedges could have interest for stabilizing cash flows.  Quite possibly Origination or Marketing could assist in promoting it to the market - unfortunately, for me to speak to anyone outside of shipping in another company would hurt me with their freight people who I have to deal with on physical vessel trading.  In addition, the freight people are not going to have the authority or descision capabilities to trade on line that trading Department Heads might have.

In- house freight books as is the case with Scott and myself experienced much more activity in 2000 then what we have seen thus far in 2001, A combined result of a smaller time charter fleet this year and declining tanker rates which makes it difficult to go long freight in the spot market as well as limited exposure to the spot market as a result of no longer having any supply contracts here in Houston as when we had 2 jet stems, 2 gas oil stems and 2 mogas stems p/month with the vens. In addition we had more spot biz with trinidad and columbia and several supply commitments in West Coast S.America.  Im confident if the EOL Tanker freight took off  we would once again be able to experience the same success we have seen each year thus far in ship trading by increasing our presence in the markets.

The U.S. broker MJLF, particularly Bob Flynn, has been trying to get this off the ground now for over 5 years and even had an unsuccessful JV with Citibank.  Reason being, Citibank wasn't calling the market but was interested in it from a commission standpoint (as was the case with mjlf) but setting up avenues of hedges for ship building and vessel ownership.  FIynn presently has a seller for 2 voyages p/month starting in July.  The pricing would be the first 5 days and last 5 days of each month at ws 190 - he has a bid of 160 - so there's a lot of middle ground to get this done.  This is always the case and is why in the States there have only been about 2 deals concluded overall.
Flynn, whose motivation is commissions, can be viewed as either a competitor of ours or instrumental in helping us with establishment.  For it would be in his best interest for there to be high activity, and as he is the only one presently in the States to have a seller or bid I feel he would be easy to manipulate and as stated before he is part of the panel.  If this was to take off to the level that Enron has taken other markets -- whereby futures rates are nowhere near indicative of physical freight and trades are being done off of different pricing scenarios i.e.- months average- specific day close's, first half/2nd half, etc -- if it became so big that sellers weren't just owners and bids weren't just charterers but more of a global book balancing tool, who knows what can be done.  The last time we tried to get this going was last year when we had an analyst named Sameer in the group who was coordinating the launch with Louise Kitchen; I believe it lost momentum with legal.  Since London has been able to get it going under the direction of Scott Moncrieff we should also be able to offer it here.  Scott advises me that he has the support/infrastructure that enables him to still cover the physical freight markets as it applies to the product traders as well as the global freight market and ship arbitrage opportunities that we both follow now.

I would appreciate any advice or guidance on what would be the best way to pursue this and get it on the website. I am by no means trying to pass the buck here and am available to anyone who might need some insight to the freight markets be it technical or commercial and welcome the idea of a explaining worldscale and volatility as im sure is the case with Scott in London.

Mark,

Per my voice mail, I would be very grateful if you or someone in your department could give this confirmation letter a quick review before lunch.  The intent of the deal is that we will pay Deseret a fixed price in exchange for a floating price based on the DJ-PV index.  However, if Deseret's plant goes down, then both parties will suspend payments the day following the unit outage, and resume payments once the unit comes back online.  If the index turns out to be greater than our fixed payment, we will pay Deseret  50% of the delta between the index and the fixed price.  

Please call or e-mail me with your comments.  My number is (503) 464-7795.

Thanks so much,

Steve

"RE: Hi, hope everything is okay with you and your trip went well","I'm fine.  I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.

Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.  

If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.  It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.

Hope you are doing ok through all this.  I'm just sort of numb.

Mark

Mark,

We have recently completed our Gas Trading Audit.  From our audit, we
identified an item to be addressed pertaining to legal's involvement in the
confimation process.  Throughout our audit, we were in contact with Jeff
Hodge; however, since our action item pertains to both physical and
financial deals, I wanted to forward this item to you for your review.
(Item D in the high priority section)

(See attached file: Natural Gas Trading.ppt)

Upon review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments.

Thank you,

Sharon
