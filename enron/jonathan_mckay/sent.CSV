"CFA","Dear Mr. Raffaele,

My name is Jon McKay and I just moved from Calgary, Canada to Houston.  Just prior to moving I passed the Level III C.F.A. exam and now find my self in need of a sponsor to join the Houston society.  I was wondering if you could put me in contact with some of the local charter holders so that I could obtain sponsor ship and join the Houston society.  I was not member of the society in Calgary, as I was waiting to pass the third examination before joining, but I could provide some contacts in Calgary that hold charters, who would a test to my character.  If you had a local membership list, or even just a list of Enron employee who have C.F.A. Charters that I could contact, it would be greatly appreciated.

If you can help please contact me at (w) 713 853-4810, (h) 713 225-1230 or, at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

Thank you,

Long time no e-mail!....  Things here are starting to settle down a little.  I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the Houston Grand Prix.  Paul Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy Patrick?????) didn't do to well.  Although, Enron had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the ""thick"" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.

A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.

The apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.

How are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?

I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!

Attached are the Enron Code of Ethics, which includes Enron's IT Security Policies for employees, and the Enron IT Control Standards, which are the standards against which IT controls are audited by Arthur Andersen, our internal auditors. As you are aware, every employee must sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by the Code of Ethics once a year.

In addition to these documented policies, Enron also has a group, IT Compliance - the group I work in, that is responsible for managing Enron's IT risks and ensuring compliance with policies.

I hope this is what you were looking for. Please call if there is anything else we can help with.

How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relating to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I think it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved.  Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to the cuts and what we can and can not do.

This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.

No.  If they declare FM against us, the operative wording in the agreement is ""to the extent that they are affected by such event"".  In other words, they can only cut a deal to the extent the force majeure prevents them from performing.

Subject:	ENA-ECC Force Majeure

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physical gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreement and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mechanics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of force majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery point force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on the transaction, the definition of ""force majeure"" may be amended in the terms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted under this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, in the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such Party's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that they are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and during the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The Party receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Day period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder and both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the definition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definition may be amended in the particular confirm.

"RE: Canadian office","Frank,

By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.  Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.  It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.  The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.  If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.

I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.

I have changed the format around to landscape and currently have everything in the report on one page.  Perhaps we should sit down and talk about which interconnects are the most important to add, because there are quite a few.  Right now, I see interconnects with TGT, Tenn, CNG, Transco, CGT, and NFG.  With so many important points, I am not sure which ones to add and which are negligible.

Jon was seeking some information on possible sources for Meteorological employment. I spoke to Jim Renick who is the General Manager of our Alberta program and he has e-mailed this information. He also indicated the university of Texas A&M, was a possible locale to find some graduates, and or students, depending on what level of experience you were seeking. 
If you need anything else, let me know.

I wanted to ask if I could use the Video 1 Boardroom for Leadership Training tomorrow.  It is available, but I was informed that I needed to ask you first if we have an outside guest.  Michele Brown is the facilitator (the numbers on the board should mean nothing to her as she is not from the industry) and everyone else is internal.  We were unable to book our regular room at the E&Y Tower and Video 2 is a little crowded.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Hi Jonathan, 
Our compliance department has just contacted us back regarding your request to hold a small cash account here to pay your RSP fees each year.  Their suggestion is that we sell the Janus mutual funds and convert this money to US funds then transfer it to your Dane Rascher account in the US because you are now a US resident and the Investment regulations want it handled that way.
You could simply send us a cheque for the RSP fees when we notify you each June. 
I hope you had a good holiday season, did you get home for Christmas?  Let me know by phone if we can proceed as suggested above and I will look after it for you in the new year.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: Line Rupture at South Wapiti

This is what I know so far... the South Wapiti inlet header blew up.  The inspection team is going out today to survey the damage.  From speaking to Ron Johnson (operator @ S Wapiti), he feels the damage is significant thus many parts and valves will have to be changed out.  Depending on crews and availability of parts, the plant will be 0 (zero) for at least 2 days if not until mid next week.  South Wapiti produces approximately 80% of Iroquois Creek meter thus 200,000 GJ will be off until the plant is back up.

I will keep you informed on any new information.

There has been a line rupture at the South Wapiti plant which has resulted
in about 200 mmcf off the NOVA system.  Des doesn't have any details as yet
other than we will likely lose about 5000 gj of production today.  Her info
so far says that no one was hurt but the fire trucks are there.  We'll keep

John,
Would it be possible for you to assign one person that is easily accessible to provide Jesus with indicative pricing for Empress throughout the month?  Possibly Ryan Watt? Maybe you could include Jesus on an email distribution list (if there is such a thing) to provide him with indicatives.  We have one customer in particular that likes kicking tires, and Jesus doesn't like bothering you guys all the time for him.

"RE: AGA Numbers","The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.  But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.

I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.

Has your view that we are likely to see prices trending down changed based on the AGA numbers that we saw yesterday?  Or is that just a short term fluctuation?

 ENRON CHAIRMAN GREETED WITH CREAM PIE IN CALIFORNIA
     Enron Corp President Jeff Skilling defended his company's
role in the California power crisis and got a cream pie in his
face for his trouble, reports Reuters. Skilling, speaking at the
Commonwealth Club of California, attacked the Golden State's
botched deregulation, adding: ""People in California are angry,
and they should be."" The pie thrower was ejected from the
meeting.
     Later, Skilling voiced doubts about FERC's implementation of
limited price caps saying they could work against the free market
principle and put a damper on investment in new generation the
state badly needs. He suggested that a combination of new
generating capacity, a more rational regulatory framework and
consumer conservation could bring prices down. ""This one is easy
to fix, and it will be fixed,"" Skilling concluded. ""You'll get
supply, you'll get reduction in demand, and prices will
collapse.""
     Meanwhile, today's Washington Post reports that Duke Energy
has been ordered by FERC to pay millions of dollars in refunds to
California, turning down the energy generator's explanation of
the high prices it charged in January for wholesale power. Duke
was told it should have charged no more than $273 per megawatt
hour, while the utility argued that charging nearly $3,900 MWH
during short supply periods was alright because it risked not
getting paid  (Reuters, June 21, Washington Post, pg. E-2, June
22, http://www.washingtonpost.com ).

Subject:	Reliant Entex-Tennessee Pipeline

Received a phone call on Thursday, December 13th approx. 9:15am from Royal Edmondson, Gas Control Manager for Reliant Entex.  He was trying to locate Victoria Versen and was eventually  transferred to me.  He wanted to make sure Enron was delivering gas to the Entex's city gates.  He asked if  Enron was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gates were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tennessee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility that the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city gates were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was automatically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what the storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the storage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on that matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome with Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered.  

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.   

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provide too much information without knowing his full intentions.

I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.

Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920)
Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007)
Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960)
Encal			C$(14,574,960)


Howard Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to show you the progress so far on the Map.  It is pretty rough.  I am worried about Space constraints on the sheet.  As a result, I have cut out Armagh, Lilly, Entriken, Shermansdale, and Bernville on the northern pipe.  Storage points are square and the data in yellow backgrounds.  Compressors are circles with clear data table backgrounds.  I would like any guidance you guys have on how to fit more points in, or which points to drop.  I want to add Transco at Linden, and I am researching other interconnects.

Also, I talked to the IT guys and I will have the links for the Map data up by this evening.
I had signed up for a training class this Thurs and Fri, but forgot to mention it last Friday.  I will have the Map finished by Wednesday, and I will fix any problems after the training class Thurs and Fri.

Thanks,

Adam

The basis numbers published for the 14th were quite different for three of the numbers published

Sumas CashSpread:  Correct basis:  -.495;  Basis Published: -.315
Aeco CashSpread:     Correct basis:  --.478;  Basis Published: -.536
Sumas June Spread:     Correct basis: -.45;  Basis Published +.055

The Sumas June spread is WAY off.

Would you be able to get the numbers fixed for the 15th publication.  We have received a phone call for three days in a row now from Lavo wondering why we marked our curves so off.  We have not marked our curves wrong but the report is wrong.  If this schedule helps I can send it tonight as well.  As I have stated before it would not be correct to get Aeco and Sumas IM numbers for ANY pubcode other that Sumas-US/IM or Aeco-Cdn/IM.  The other pubcodes are not correct 100% of the time.

John,

I have added the curves to a curve fetch file in O:\ERMS\Excel Queries\JMcKayCurveFetch.xls
I did not know which curves to get rid of, but if you go through it just hide the ones that you don't want, you won't have to go back and add them later.  I have access to the folder and file, but I don't have rights to run the macro.  I have tacked the curves you requested to the last four columns of each sheet (one sheet for dailies and the other sheet for basis curves).  Call with any questions.

Adam,

The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.

If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,

BACK FOR SECONDS 
Houston again named fattest city in America by national magazine 
By DANIEL J. VARGAS 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Isn't it just like Houston to go for seconds? 
This title-craving city has been named the fattest, plumpest, most rotund city in America by Men's Fitness for a second consecutive year. 
Weigh to go. 
Fattest cities 1. Houston 2. Chicago 3. Detroit 4. Philadelphia 5. Dallas 6. Columbus, Ohio 7. San Antonio 8. Fort Worth 9. St. Louis 10. Indianapolis Fittest cities 1. Colorado Springs, Colo. 2. Denver 3. San Diego 4. Seattle 5. San Francisco 6. Virginia Beach, Va. 7. Honolulu 8. Sacramento, Calif. 9. Albuquerque, N.M. 10. Boston 	
""Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free,"" the magazine writes. 
Last year, Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective, angry mother. 
In 2002, the message is soaking in like a juicy, half-pound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun. 
""The first year we were kind of upset because we weren't happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people can't control,"" says Shadston Pittman, fitness coordinator for the city's Parks and Recreation Department. ""This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now. I think we can show the world (weight loss) is a priority for us. 
""But they still got us. Again."" 
In fact, Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor. Sorry, they came in 10th. 
""I didn't think we'd be number one because of the proactive steps we took,"" he says. 
For the country's 50 largest cities, the magazine took existing data and issued grades in 16 categories such as overweight and obesity rates (D), air quality (F), TV viewing habits (F), water quality (D), parks and open space (D+), nutrition (B-) and climate (C). 
When the grades were tallied, Houston once again found itself at the head of the class, albeit the one with all the detention-serving kids. 
The Men's Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday. (Meanwhile, we apparently should hit the treadmill.) 
Not to be outdone, other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side. 
Dallas ranked fifth. San Antonio was seventh. Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at 14th. 
The only Texas city on the light side was Austin, ranked as the 16th fittest. The fittest city was Colorado Springs, Colo. 
Karen Calabro, coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, says although she doesn't put much stock into the magazine's formula, Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds. 
""We could all lose some weight. Me included,"" the registered dietitian says. 
Houston, Calabro says, isn't the only city with a caloric-intake and sedentary epidemic. 
Nationally, 55 percent of adults are overweight or obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
As your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, Calabro says. 
""A big part of this obesity problem,"" she says, ""is that we're not exercising"" -- not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk. 
We opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name. We see escalators as our new best friend. And we drive to the corner store for ice cream. 
But Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image. 
After Houston earned the first unsolicited title, Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia, which owned the ""fattest"" ranking in 2000. 
Philly started a citywide campaign called ""Fun, Fit and Free"" to get its residents to slim down. Last year, Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place. 
Pittman, who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year, says Houston's version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphia's. However, there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible. 
The city's get-fit effort will kick off Jan. 17 when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston. 
The problem is so serious that Subway is sending its big-gun spokesman to the Jan. 17 event. 
From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside City Hall, 900 Smith, participants can meet Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds on a diet of low-fat, low-calorie Subway sandwiches, and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a two-week free membership to Bally Total Fitness. 
""That Jared's a nice guy,"" Pittman says. ""That's his full-time job now."" 
People would agree that losing weight is a full-time task. 
The city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the ""Five a Day"" message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day. That effort kicks off Jan. 22. 
""We're not saying everyone has to run 10 miles a day around Memorial Park,"" Pittman says. ""We're talking just simple lifestyle changes."" 
Later this year, Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called ""Shape Up Texas"" to improve health and wellness among Texans. That's not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up 20 percent of the fat list and four of the top eight. 
Mayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall. 
Brown, who has put on a few pounds since taking office, says he isn't surprised by Houston's expansive reputation. 
""I'm afraid I've contributed to that,"" he says. 
Brown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself, not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more. However, he wouldn't reveal how much weight he planned to shed. 
Pittman applauds the mayor's words about weight loss. 
""It's great when you have someone of that stature visibly being a speaker for health and fitness,"" he says. 
The last thing we want is a three-peat in 2003.

Good Evening,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $94 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, however, all parking changes must be made via e-mail, no later than 1/18/01. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.

Jon, 

Since the Time Execption System has been disconnected Tricia has asked that we manually record the days off people request.  
Chad had requested Friday August 3rd as a Friday off and Monday August 6th - Friday August 10th as vacation days before the system was disconnected.  
Unfortunately, I can no longer acces the system to see if his days off were approved.  He made his request prior to Zufferli's transition, so I am unsure if you are to approve his days or if it is John.

If you could me know if his days are approved, that would be great.

Thank-you

"FW: Relocation Info/851367","Hi Rod,

I am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what I am being told as far as selecting a realtor (see below).  Today I am going to talk to the relocation people and do what I can about keeping things going with you.  The relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on, as demonstrated by their reference to ""favorable tax treatment"", but if they insist on having Royal LePage I wanted to see if you could speak to them directly.  My preference is to have you represent me, but if they are ""paying the bills"" I may have little choice.

Best Regards,

Jon

John:

I did some investigating on the Canadian homesale piece and found out some
interesting facts.  First one and the most important one is that I will not
be handling that piece of the relocation.  Instead a young woman by the name
of Severine Jennings will be handling that our of our International
Department and her number is 800/241-6529 ext. 75910.  She specializes in
Canadian properties and will be the better person to assist you.
Secondly, there is a real need for you to use Royal LePage as the agency to
list your home and the reason is that they know everything there is to know
about the favorable tax treatment on sale of your home.  They know how to
handle the sale in the ""U.S. way"" and they follow all the strict guidelines
of relocation.  Severine will contact you to go over all this with you
tomorrow.

I will still be your contact for all othe aspects of your relocation.
Remember, Billie will call you tomorrow to get you wiring information for
your lump sum calculations.

Talk to you on Monday - have a great weekend.

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if these are valid books and ID's.

"RE: Did You get the Check?","I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  Geof Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.

Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.

I have noticed that there is still a sizeable chunk of change in my bank

How are you settling into things down there?  Stuff was pretty crazy around
here last week.  They cancelled classes on Tuesday and delayed them on Wed.
We also had many vigils and moments of silence.  A couple of my friends here
were directly impacted, in addition to one of my profs.  Not good.  Kind of
makes you feel like moving back to Canada.  Other than that, we have started
to learn some pretty cool things in our organizational behavior class, and
sharpened up our excel skills in a decision sciences class.  School is fun.

"RE: What's Happening?","Jeff,

Good to hear from you.  Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  Enron keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.

Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of Houston.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.

Trading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. 

I hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Regards,

Jon

Subject:	What's Happening?

Jon, I though I would check in and see how things are going down south.  I
talked to the boys in Calgary last week about the PSAC report, I guess that
they were going to the luncheon last week and wondering if they should anti
up the money for the report.  Other than that, I haven't talked to them
much, but can't wait to get home for Christmas.

Things have been pretty busy up here, I have spent a lot of time partying,
but even more time studying and working.  We have finals next week, then
have a week off, and start up again.  So far, things have gone pretty well,
and I have learned some pretty neat things (why Napster was an efficient
solution, why Microsoft included I.E. in their operating system...).  We are
finishing the accounting (thank goodness), and will be starting into capital
markets and more spreadsheet classes.  All in all, we have covered a lot of
the material that was in the first year of the CFA, but also learned a
little more about the softer subjects and case analysis.

The social scene here is pretty good, other than a definite lack of women.
Our class had one of the lowest female participant rates in history, and it
is starting to show on the faces of many of the single guys in my class
(myself included).  Four of us took a run up to Montreal on Friday for the
night, and it was a welcome relief.  Other than that, we can't complain too
much.  I started to play hockey once a week, and bought a ski pass that I
should be able to use in a few more weeks.

I am starting to think about what I am going to do next summer, and wanted
to talk to you about a few things.  I was considering a brief foray into the
consulting industry, and was thinking about a company in Boston that
specializes in the natural gas and power markets.  They have a pretty good
staff, and are very technical in terms of project valuations, and analysis.
I think that it would be a good, different background, but wanted to talk to
you (and possibly your girlfriend), about other types of work or companies
within the industry, including Enron.

Let me know when you get time to talk, and also let me know how things are
going in Houston.

Later.

John, my understanding of our deal with you to sell 51 GJ's of gas to you each day until the end of June was at the AECO daily price with no discount. The Schedule A for Sitara 838545 shows a discount of $0.06835 per GJ. If this should be 0 can you let  me and Lisa McIsaac know so the contract can be changed, if not can you contact Kate or myself when you have a break in trading or after trading has closed for the day.

Jay,

Attached are the Enron Code of Ethics, which includes Enron's IT Security Policies for employees, and the Enron IT Control Standards, which are the standards against which IT controls are audited by Arthur Andersen, our internal auditors. As you are aware, every employee must sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by the Code of Ethics once a year.

In addition to these documented policies, Enron also has a group, IT Compliance - the group I work in, that is responsible for managing Enron's IT risks and ensuring compliance with policies.

I hope this is what you were looking for. Please call if there is anything else we can help with.

Hey Jon,

Can you give me 1, 2, 3, 5 yrs out of Nov 1/01 for SMED (profile attached)? They are pretty keen to deal, but they haven't yet given me their financials. There is potential for us to straighten everything out today. Realizing you always give me tight pricing, can you give me your best here? They want to deal with us as we order furniture from them, but are squeezing us a little saying there is another competitor who is better than us. I have tightened our margins to $0.15/GJ which is small in the retail market even for this size of account.

Thanks, Mark.

"NGX","Jay,

The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.

Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  

Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.

Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.

Happy 4th of July,

Jon

"FW: Pricing","Kate,
 
Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.  Given their load profile we would be offered at 4.39/gj for supply one year out of August.  Please let me know if you need any thing else.
 
Best Regards,
 
Jon

Jon,
 
I'm not going to be in tomorrow and Kate Joslyn is going to close the Lindsay Park deal for me.  Could you Email pricing to her directly instead of to me.  Thanks Jon.
 
Hey, if you ever need some tickets to go to a game let me know.

We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.

Jon,
 
Lindsay Park is being a pain in the butt - could you update me on price.  I know we are up today - when do you think prices may get back down to 4.25 range again?
 
Start Date - August 1

"Understanding TCO","Hello Everyone,

It is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E.  Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:

1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

3)	Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)

4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)

Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.

Regards,

Jon

"RE: working again","Hellllooooo,

How are you doing?  I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but there has been a lot going on these days.  The move still is not quit complete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.  I ended up selling you curio (sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV. cabinet.  Hence I have a cheque for you that needs to be sent, or picked up if you like?

The move has gone pretty well all things considered.  We managed to fit two 2000 square foot homes into one 900 square foot apartment.  It kind of has the cluttered eclectic New York apparent look to it.........you know the same as your basement in Summerland.  Nothing major got damaged, in the move so that helps.  I still have to switch over my car registration and insurance, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.

I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.  I've gone to two college football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre Dame, and one in Austin to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.  They were both day trips about two and a half hours from Houston, so the drives were not that bad.  Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,000 other fans.  It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by that many people.  Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston.  This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toronto each year.  There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but both of them had a bad day.  One of them crashed and the other finished way back.  The highlight was that Enron had sponsored a car just for that race that was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.  Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pretty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.

Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to give it some time.  Enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all the wrong reasons.  It sounds like one of the ""way high-ups"" had a questionable kick back deal with Enron that has come under attack.  The Board of Directors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are starting to ask questions now.  It looks like my plan for early retirement is out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 to $25.  So much for getting stock options as your bonus.

Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.  There seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media can latch its teeth into rip apart.  I'm actually getting tired of all the rumors and fear mongering that is going on.  I figure if my time is up, than so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a waste of energy.

I hope the new job goes well.  I'm glad to hear that your back working, I was starting to worry about you a little.  You know what can happen when people lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to stop going out all together.

Anyway, its time for me to start working so I have to go now.  Take care and have fun at your new job!

Love

Jon

Hi
Thought I would drop you a quick note.  I do not know if your mom told you but I went back to work just over a week ago.  Wal-Mart is opening a new store here so I applied and got a job.  We are in the process of setting up the store, shelves etc. plus stocking them.  Lots of work but I have a good partner to work with.  It took us about three days to find eachother but we work well together and make sure we head for the same area each day.
Winter is here.  We have about 4 inches of snow so far.  It is only about -4 so not cold at all.  Not much news other than going back to  work so will run for now.  Drop me a line and let me know how all of the mess in New York has been effecting you.
Say hi to Beth for me as well.     
Lots of Love   Donna

Sung to American Pie

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price
used
to
make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened
to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but
February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in the
Boardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read
about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside,
the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, ""Why Ask Why"",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.
Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff
above,
if
the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can
mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears.
He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I
was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the
dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George
and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and
while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit
had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought
it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling
will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We
started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space
with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff
S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh
and
as
I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO
cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success
is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and
Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I
had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the

"RE: long time no talk","Hello,

Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a change'n with my life.

First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I drove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't that bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You would have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture, and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com.  Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but the traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself..""Why did they do this drive?""  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She rented a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http://astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She took a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thing is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. The good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale group so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are low.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same business but none-the-less for the same company.

Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up moving to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mere coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my house anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have no problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiation is in the lead as it stands.

Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV stand, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in Houston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furniture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk about what is best.

Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the same), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself for trying!

Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.

Love,

Jon

Hi Jon,

Thought I would drop you a note to see how you are
doing.  I haven't heard from you for ages and was
wondering what you are up to.

If Beth is down for Stampeed say Hi to her for me.

We are slowly getting things sorted out and under
control around here.  We have all of the major inside
projects done and Ron is just about finished putting
up the fence.  This is good as they have just posted a
caution bear in the area sign on the mailboxes.  The
fence should keep them away from the house, I hope.

I sent pictures of the place to your mum so reminde
her to show them to you the next time you see her.  I
really like the place.  Lots of work to keep me busy
and out of trouble but not as much work as the house
and yard in Calgary.

Rons mum coming for a visit on 18 July.  Will take her
out and about in the Yukon and a couple of places in
Alaska.  I am looking forward to going on a tour
again.

Well should run for now.  All is well with me.  Going
to the gym 3 days a week and am working on quitting
smoking, again.

Lots of Love

Donna

Subject:	RE: Next Thursday

Thanks Jon,
The work I've been doing here mostly involves project finance and balance
sheet lending to foreign companies.  I'm not necessarily looking to do this
from Calgary though.  When I look at my transferable skills, they basically
boil down to credit analysis, negotiation and documentation.

I've been on EDC's mining and power team for the past year and I really find
the work extremely interesting.  On the power side, Suzanne has a friend who
works for Power-X in Van. as a trader/marketer and his line of work sounds
extremely interesting.  I've talked to Alan W. about his work before and he
said marketing is marketing no matter what the product.  So gas is also of
interest.  This would be a bit of a career change for me and would need to
learn the ropes, but I have no ego.

Also of interest (outside of Enron) is equity research (for an investment
dealer), corporate/project finance (for power/O&G sponsors), and even
investment banking (though Andy has turned almost turned me off on this!).
I'm working on a big power deal in Mexico and wouldn't mind being on the
sponsor's side of the table (vs. banker's).  I'm sure TransAlta has several
generation projects that could be interesting.  I'd be on more familiar
ground in any of these roles and could pretty much hit the ground running.

Is this specific enough?  If nothing else, I'll be able to expand my contact
list to more than 2 (you and Andy!)

Paul

Subject:	Understanding TCO

Hello Everyone,

It is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E.  Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:

1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

3)	Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)

4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)

Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.

Regards,

Jon

Hi Jon,

Enron currently markets about 4.5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day.
I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12bcf a day that the NIT number can  easily be double this. It doesn't appear that Enron markets 50% of Alberta's gas each day...yet.  

I hope this answers your question, let me know if you need anything else.

Jon
We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in Toronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in Alberta. 
1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
2.  Can we publically make this representation?  

Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your analysts puts together for the morning meeting? 

Many thanks
Kate

Here is the slide including Canada Gas Volumes - 

 << OLE Object: Microsoft PowerPoint Slide >> 

Here are the talking points - 


North America Natural Gas Volumes - By Region

?	Enron has a very strong, well-established, broad-based North American natural gas business.  We deliver gas to over 2,000 customers at over 2,200 points across North America.

?	Volumes in each major region increased in the first quarter:
-	In the West, volumes in the second quarter almost doubled to 3.9 Bcf/d.  This increase has been in response to the unprecedented volatility and tight market for gas throughout much of the West.  The West is our smallest region, comprising approximately 15% of our North America gas business.
-	In Canada, our volumes in the second quarter of 2001 decreased 23% over the second quarter of 2000 to 5.8 Bcf/d due to fact that during 2000 we offered a fixed price Alberta gas product through EOL that our customers used to hedge commodity price risk.  With the Alliance Pipeline coming on-line in late 2000, our customers began making more extensive use of EOL's financial NYMEX-like products as an alternative.  During 2001, Enron did not offer this product in an effort to focus on higher margin products.  Our Canadian region continues its strong contribution to our total North America gas activities.  
-	In our Central region, second quarter volumes increased 11% over a year ago to 7.2 Bcf/d.  Our strong, broad-based presence in the region allowed us to grow our Central region business consistently over the last few years.  In addition, our alliance with Peoples' Gas to develop the Chicago hub has brought increased liquidity to the region.
-	In the East, our volumes in the second quarter of 2001 increased 29% over the second quarter of 2000 to 9.0 Bcf/d.  The East region is our largest region, comprising 35% of our North America Gas business.
-	Across all of our regions, EnronOnline contributed to the strong, overall increase in volumes during the quarter.

I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.

I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.

Things are going awesome down here, I spent all of last week rowing around the ocean (not as much fun as it sounds!), and spent the weekend with a couple of buddies in Quebec City (also not quite as fun as it sounds!).  
 
I can't believe the people that I have met down here, everyone is really friendly, and all have interesting stories/pasts!  You should seriously think about coming down here, I can't think of another place that I would rather be!
 
Anyway, I will let you guys know a little more when I finally get my computer, as I am using one in a common lounge area (right beside the pool table in my residence!).  
 
Any new information on currency?  I am probably going to have to think about converting it over pretty soon.

Subject:	ENA-ECC Force Majeure

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physical gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreement and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mechanics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of force majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery point force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on the transaction, the definition of ""force majeure"" may be amended in the terms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted under this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, in the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Majeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such Party's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the other Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that they are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and during the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The Party receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Day period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder and both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the definition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definition may be amended in the particular confirm.

Hi Kelly,

We have had a quick sell-off in gas prices this A.M. A tropical wave that some were fearing would develop into a hurricane has not progressed and the fear that Gulf of Mexico gas production facilities would be threatened has dissipated. As well, hedge fund selling has pushed the market a little lower.

Indicative prices, subject to revision, for SMED's load shape, commencing Nov. 1/01:

1 yr - C$4.50/GJ
2 yr - C$4.65/GJ
3 yr - C$4.76/GJ
5 yr - C$4.87/GJ

Please let me know if there is anything further I can do for you at the moment. I will be leaving on holidays later today and will be returning on Aug. 20/01. In my absence, Greg Mann (663-2817) and Kate Joslyn (663-2801) are familiar with SMED's requirements and would be pleased to assist.

Hi
Thanks for the note.  It was great to hear from you and to know that all of the BS down there is not really effecting you and your fun.
My new address is:   Donna Ackert,  21 McPherson Road, WHITEHORSE, Y.T. Y1A 5S3.  Phone #(867) 456-2154.
You do not have to worrie about sending me a cheque.  It is not a big deal.  Just take yourselves out for a nice dinner or whatever and have a drink for me while your at it.  I just appreciate you looking after my Daultons for me while you could.
Work is coming along.  We are in the process of putting product on the shelves.  What a mess everything is in.  We have 24 days before opening and if we make it I will be surprised.  Lack of any sence of organization is a big problem.  All I can say is, I am glad that I am just a flunkie because if I owned the place Heads would roll.
The old bod keeps forgetting that it is six years older than it was in Summerland and just can't figure out why it is so pooped at the end of the day.  I really don't know how I managed 7 days a week, for weeks on end.  GETTING OLD IS NO FUN AT ALL.
Well best get for now.  Love to both you and Beth.
Donna

Hi John, this is Kim.  Royal LePage Relocations will handle absolutely
everything.  You don't have to worry about a thing.  They will pay you when
all is done.  If you need to get a hold of them, just let me know and I can
forward a phone number and contact.

Hope it's not too hot down there!!

Take care,
Kim

Hi Rod,

I'm sorry I have not been reachable but I was waiting until I had all the
info you needed before I contacted you.  The new info is as follows:

#1808, 909 Texas Ave.
Houston, Texas, 77002

jonathan.mckay@enron.com

(h) 713 225-1230
(w) 713 853-4810
(f) 713 646-8453


Do you know what happens next?  Do I need a lawyer?  Do any other
provisions remain?  Any idea how I get paid? Any help would be appreciated!

Best Regards,

Jon


As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble
Beach..........Just kidding.

you please call Dale Onrait at 250-712-2195 and have him liquidate the

Jon, I am speaking with SMED first thing tomorrow morning (between 7 and 8) around their gas needs (they appear to finally be ready to get this one off their plates).

Can you get me fresh 1, 2, 3 and 5 year prices out of Nov. 1st.

I'll hopefully quit bugging you on this one very soon.

"","Glen,

So its time for Monday night football and I was thinking about how you'd hitting on some waitress at Hooters.  Ahhhhh those were the days!   How are things going?  What's new in the world?  Things here seem to be running there course.  Remember the movie Wall Street where they arrest ""Bud Fox"" for insider trading and it is the beginning of the end.  Well I think Bud might have worked here, and the whole company seems to be coming down with him.  I don't know if it is getting much press in Canada but the mighty Enron has fallen on hard times and we are in the process of merging with another company down here as a way of staying afloat.  We seem to have run out of cash and can't pay the bills.  Visa and Mastercard are maxed out.  Its kind of got me soul searching and I'm trying to decided what to do next.  I can stay where I am and wait and see what comes of the merger, but its kind of like sticking with the Expo's, no one is certain what the future is. Or, I can try and jump ship, catch on with another gas trading company, but the problem is the grass is Never as green on the other side of the fence.  Hence the soul searching and dilemma.  Anyway, I just thought I'd drop you a note, see how things are going.  Dolphins seem to be doing ok, 6-2, life could be worse.

I'm going to Tampa Bay for American Thanksgiving and kind of looking forward to the couple of days off.  And I'm coming to Calgary for Christmas.  I get in late Friday the 21st and head back to Houston Sunday the 30th.  Maybe we could get everyone together and go skiing one day, drinks at minimum.  Anyway I have to get back to work.  I hope all is well in Cow town and say hi to one of the waitress for me tonight

"RE: wow","People down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!

I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).

Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.

"RE: New info","Glen,

YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.

Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com

How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.

Hi Jonathan, 
A couple of questions for you: 
1) Have you proceeded with opening an account at Dane Rauscher yet? 
2) Your RSP account has a small debit of $50.00, probably due to RSP holding fees charged to the account for 2001.  We either need a cheque from you for the $50.00 or we need to sell $50.00 worth of something to generate the $50.00 in the account.
Just drop me a note or call regarding how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

"RE: Holidays","Hey Jeff,

How's it going.   Things down here are actually very slow.  They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.  In the mean time no one is trading.  I sit around most of the day and play games.  I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.  The old hurry up and wait.   Beth's (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.  She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.  Things down here could not have gone worse for her. I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.

Are you an unsecured Enron creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?  How are thing there?  Are you liking school?

I'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).  I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.  You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.

Hi Jon

Just read your message.  Sounds like you are going to
be very busy for the next while.  Your house will
probably sell very fast as it is in a great area and
it is a nice place.

You can just sell the cabinets of mine if you want.  I
don't have room for them and neither does your mum or
if you want just take them with you if you want them.
I just dropped a note to your mum to ask her to keep
the mirror for me as she has the table and I am sure
she will keep the Daultons if you do not want to take
them with you.  I know you may not as they are a pain
in the but to haul arround with you.

If you talk to Steve and he wants the TV cabinte he is
welcome to have it, but if he can not use if again
just sell it when you start selling off your stuff.

My new phone is (867) 456-2154.  I am going away
tomorrow morning and will be gone until Sunday
evening.  Ron's mum is here and I am taking her on a
little tour.

Anyway we can talk about this more next week if that
is ok with you.  Drop me a note and let me know.

Lots of Love

Donna

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

I hope its going well!

I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.

Please give me a call to discuss.

Subject:	HSFA and AIMR membership

Jonathan:

Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the Houston Society of
Financial Analysts. The AIMR web site is your best resource for information
and forms regarding AIMR and HSFA membership.

The HSFA has two categories of membership: Regular and Affiliate. In short,
requirements for Regular membership are a college degree, the successful
completion of Level 1 and three years of acceptable professional work
experience. Requirements for Affiliate membership are a college degree and
one year of acceptable work experience. ""Acceptable work experience"" is
defined as a professional position in finance or accounting.

The HSFA holds weekly lunch meetings from September to May. The meetings are
at noon on Wednesdays at the Houston Club downtown, 811 Rusk. In addition,
there are usually three or four annual events in the evenings. After you
become a member, you will be alerted by mail and e-mail about every meeting
and event. For more HSFA information, check out
https://www.aimr.org/socservices/socpage.asp?society=HOUSTON .

To join the Houston Society, you also have to be a member of the national
AIMR organization. For AIMR membership, go to
https://www.aimr.org/memservices/join/apply.asp and fill out the Membership
Application Form.

The HSFA currently requires you to have three sponsors: your supervisor and
two HSFA members, one of whom must be outside your firm. (If your supervisor
is an HSFA member, then only two sponsors are required.) If you do not know
any HSFA members, there are people who have volunteered to serve as
sponsors. Attached is a list; just give one of them a call. The form that
your sponsors will need is attached. They may send them in directly to AIMR
or to you. At AIMR, your application package is bundled together and sent to
me for approval. I send it back to AIMR, and they will alert you of your
membership status (and invoice you for dues) by mail. The whole process can
take five weeks or more, because AIMR only processes applications once a
month.

Please call me if you have any more questions.

Subject:	Something for the boys? - part 2


TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH:


1.) Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down. We need it up,
you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.

2.) ALL men see in only 16 colours. Peach is a fruit, not a colour.

3.) If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to
act like soap opera guys.

4.) If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

5.) Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we
can find the perfect present yet again!

6.) If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

7.) Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us
what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, or the shotgun formation.

8.) Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

9.) Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

10.) When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.

Really.

11.) You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.

12.) Crying is blackmail.

13.) Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't
work. Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say
it!

14.) No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark Anniversaries on
the calendar.

15.) Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

16.) Most guys own three pairs of shoes. What makes you think we'd be any
good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your
dress?

17.) Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

18.) Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's
what we do.

19.) Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

20.) A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

21.) Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce Lee or
some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're saying anyway.

22.) Check your oil.

23.) It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz
together.

24.) No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

25.) Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All
comments become null and void after 7 days.

26.) If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

27.) Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

28.) You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something,
but not both.

29.) Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials.

30.) If it itches, it will be scratched.

31.) Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

32.) If we ask what's wrong and you say ""nothing,"" we will act like
nothing's wrong.

33.) We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.
