Subject:	ERCOT Update


The ERCOT Board approved the congestion zones for next year, 2001. The ERCOT Board accepted the 3 CSC 4 CM Zone model for use in commercial congestion management for 2002.  Effective date is January 1, 2002.  The three CSC's are Graham-Parker 345 kV DCKT, Sandow-Temple 345 kV DCKT and STP-DOW 345 kV DCKT.  The four CM Zones are West02, North02, South02 and Houston02.  A power point presentation along with a map is available at ftp://ftp.ercot.com/CSCDATA/csc.htm.  

Current Congestion Cost and Outlook.  The congestion charges that have been incurred are 55.6 million or 137 million depending on the methodology used to calculate the charge. If you look purely at the scheduled MWs then it is 137 MM based upon the ERCOT protocols. The actual cost to redispatch and clear congestion as of Sept. 22, 2001 was 55.6 MM. Both obviously are very high considering it is for one month of operation. 
When the 20 MM trigger was hit August 14, 2001, ERCOT has 6 month by Protocol and reaffirmed in the commission order to implement the full zonal model. This means that there will no longer be an uplift of interzonal congestion, rather a direct assignment of the charge. The charge may be partially offset by the TCR that will be auctioned. The PUCT has indicated an interest to move to direct assignment prior to the development and implementation of a TCR instrument as a hedge.  I am chairing the congestion management working group that is deciding the TCR issue and will be dealing with the local congestion issues when that trigger has been hit.  I will attach a copy of the current draft of the TCR white paper.  In short, the TCR is a financial option that can be purchased as hedge against zonal congestion.  There is no physical requirement for the TCR in that you do not have to physically schedule to receive the benefit of the TCR.  There will be an auction on or about the 4th of February, 2002 and the full zonal implementation will take place February 15, 2002.  The tentative schedule is as follows:
?	10/5/01 - Distribute draft TCR White Paper
?	10/22/01 - Review and edit draft TCR White Paper
?	10/30/01 - Distribute TCR White Paper to WMS
?	11/1/01 - WMS Meeting; vote on PRR
?	11/8/01 - TAC Meeting
?	11/19/01 - Board Meeting
?	12/4/01 - ERCOT issues notice of TCR Auction
?	2/15/02 - First effective date of TCRs and direct assignment of CSC Congestion Costs
 
Capacity Auction.  The capacity auction workshops have begun to rework that capacity rule and problems experienced with the last round.  There was an initial discussion on the problems that were experienced with credit and how the standard was one-way and the buyers of capacity were left without recourse.  There was a subsequent conference call with the credit professionals to discuss the issues ( I did not participate) and there will be an additional meeting on the 19th.  The purpose of the short-term meeting are to rectify issues such as credit and documents prior to the March and July 2002 auctions.  Substantive issues such as the actual products, zone determination and the auction process will be part of a rulemaking prior to the September 2002 auction which includes annual products. 

Protocol Implementation.  ERCOT is in the process of determining what should be included in the Phase II design which will begin January 2001.  There is a priority list that is currently under review by ERCOT vendors to determine lead times of Phase II items in an attempt to deliver Phase II items ASAP.  Parviz Adib from MOD stressed that there are certain issues that the PUCT expects to be addressed in Phase II.  Issues that do not require major system changes might still be doable in Phase II if the PRR Process is started immediately.  There is a placeholder in the Protocols related to BULs and loads acting as resources.

Mechanism for Simultaneous Procurement of Ancillary Services.   The PUCT has expressed concern that there could be price reversals associated with the ancillary services market (if it is assumed that the various ancillary services have different levels of value to the market).  The Board had approved a contingency plan to allow price modifications in the early markets, however the plan has not been implemented.  The WMS discussed, at length, the issue of simultaneously clearing all three markets - non-spinning, regulation, and responsive reserve.  A task force was formed to initially identify the principles for developing a mechanism for simultaneous procurement of ancillary services issue.  It was suggested that a consultant be hired to develop Protocol language once the principles are identified.  The first task force meeting was cancelled and has not been rescheduled.  

Demand-Side Task Force.  Jay Zarnikau reported on activities of the Demand-Side Task Force that is addressing Balancing Up Load (BUL) Market Issues and other demand-side issues.  The PUCT expects the full functionality to be in place on January 1, 2002.  The DSTF met last on October 1st (third meeting).  The DSTF completed a draft status report on Demand-Side Resources and Demand Responsiveness.  It was noted that the work of the DSTF is not complete and has not been approved by any ERCOT Committee or the Board.  However, ERCOT was required to file a report on these issues in the STF Report.  The report reviews the policy considerations that have prompted interest in the demand side of ERCOT's market, reviews the PUCT's directive, reviews the role of demand-side resources in ERCOT's markets, and identifies the issues and impediments that the DSTF is presently addressing.  It also summarizes the options discussed by the DSTF to date.  The PUCT staff has suggested that ERCOT hire a consultant, such as Eric Hirsch, to provide more resources for this effort.  The group expects to wrap up BUL issues and address direct load control issues at its next meeting.

Unit Specific Deployments.  At the next WMS meeting October 24, 2001, there will be a discussion regarding unit specific deployments and ERCOT will discuss the issues and the difficult that participants are having to meet the ramp rates of the deployments.  The WMS will develop a list of issues and case studies for ERCOT to discuss.  The WMS also briefly discussed PRR 282 related to defining OOME as an Instructed Deviation.

Yes its true !!

Some have heard the rumor but have no fear "" Stumptown 
bike and brew "" is coming to a neighborhood near.

We did a ""test ride"" the other weekend and this drunken 
debacle proved to be quality mahem for sure.

Just to give you an idea for Saturday.  The test ride 
was out to Alameda Brewery, Lauralwood brewery, Moon and 
Six Pence, Goodfoot and then ""we closed up Dots"".

You can meet us while on the ride if 3 is a bad time, 
we'll be out for the night.

Any questions, give a call,

Cheers,

Subject: Oct. 6 Bicycle Pub Crawl and Maylay
Date:    Sun, 30 Sep 2001 15:02:15 -0700



SATURDAY, OCT 6:  SECOND INCEDENT OF THE BICYCLY PUB CRAWL/MALAY!

THE OBJECTIVE:
A band of geeks on bikes tours a loose agenda of multiple micro brewpubs 
with eager attention to quality beer and bad humor.  General chaos, mayhem 
and entropy is predicted and encouraged.  It's an amalgamation of those 
invited directly, indirectly and whoever is taken hostage.  Quaility of beer 
is usually maintained throughout the endeavour, although reputation of 
drinking establishments deteriorates.  Pimpin' hot tub available afterhours 
at homebase for post-event analysis.

THE RENDEZVOUS:
Meet Saturday, Oct. 6, 3:00 at home of Phil, hiram, John and Brian. (2921 SE 
Franklin Av: Up Hawthorne, Right onto SE 20th, Left onto Division, Right 
onto SE 29th, past Clinton & Broklyn and left onto Franklin). (503) 236-3342 
if you're lost.

Keg will be tapped, bikestand available for last minute repairs and our cat 
and dog will be fighting in the driveway for pre-game entertainment.  
Pre-game activities will also include...

BICYCLE HOOD ORNAMENTS!
Bring your favorite Lego Man, rubber sqeeky animal or StarWars figure.  
Everyone rides better with a Mojo!  Glue and Zip-ties will be provided.

WHAT TO BRING:
-Rubber chickens and hood ornaments.
-Yes, you must have a bike!  (Duh!...Just steal your roomate's!)
-For Chrissake, bring a helmut...If you don't, you probably didn't have that 
much to protect anyhow.
-It'll get dark and bikes are invisible so lights are wise
-Darts are handy at a couple of pubs.
-Yes you CAN get a DUI on a bike but has that ever actually stopped you?

"Inter-Desk Swaps - HOW TO","FYI -

It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved. I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals. (Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand. This worksheet is.)

One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of ""place holder."" An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat.

If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question. If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes.

Subject: Enron's FERC filing opposing icap



Today at FERC, Enron filed a pleading requesting the complete elimination of ""icap"" as a product (including any ""reserve type"" products) based on the fact that the real time spot markets of the RTOS can effectively price this in the cost of energy.  The pleading also includes a proposed interim approach (with a two year sunset date).  This pleading was made in response to FERC's request for comments on ""Ensuring Sufficient Capacity Reserves In Today's Energy Markets.""

The pleading and affidavit of Larry Ruff, PhD are attached.

"Last Reminder, Disaster Relief","Deadline extended through Tuesday, Sept. 25 for disaster relief donations.  So far we have $2049 ($6147 w/Enron match!).

Thanks for your support!




In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>
NY Police and Fire Widows & Children Benefit Fund,  <http://www.nypfwc.org/>

"Conflict of Interest Policy Mailing to Vendors","
Attached is a copy of a sample letter which we are sending to selected vendors of Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries as an additional step toward implementing our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business Ethics Policy.

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of which we can all be proud.

******************************************************************************************************************************

SAMPLE 
November ____, 2001
OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
<<Headquarter_Name>>
<<Street>>
<<City>><<State>><<Zip>>
<<Country>>
Dear Sir or Madam :
	Enron Corp. (""Enron"") believes in conducting its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards. As outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics, employees of Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct consequence of his/her employment with Enron. Further, Enron's Business Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.
 	Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical. Enron expects each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that document its work relationship with Enron. Enron's auditing department will routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and contractors with whom Enron does business. Your recognition of our ethical standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations. If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

 
	Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to maintaining that relationship with you.
Very truly yours,

Rahul,
	Per our conversation, please follow up with research and ake the following changes to the current model.  

		1). We want the model to use the desks hourly scalars. We also want to be able to differentiate the scalars for each year.  The current historical data the 		model uses is not applicable to the ERCOT market.

		2). We want to able to control the number of jump hours and days, and control the range of prices for those jumps for positive and negative pricing. We also 		would like to control this and change it for each individual year.

		3). Model must be capable of positive and negative pricing.


	Please get a timeline on when this can be completed.


Doug, if you have anything more that you want to be able to control in the model please let me know and I will make sure it gets done.

Regards,
Greg

As I understand it, UBS has come to an agreement with Enron for the purchase of the North America Gas/Power Trading and Marketing organization.  We either have received or are expected to receive approval from the Creditors committee today.  Creditors Committee approval is considered likely as they have been in the loop on this transaction all along.  It will most likely go in front of the judge on Monday.  Approval from the judge is expected.  I have a meeting in the next couple of hour where I will get more details.  Stay tuned ...

Recruiting Roundup

The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky
at this time.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas, but is setting up
visits to Oklahoma (he was once committed to the Sooners) and several other
schools.
WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael
Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week, but then they both
decommitted.
Williams attended Texas A&M's game Saturday and plans to come to take an
official visit to Texas the December 14 weekend.
* * * *
The Longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or
more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year. However, he injured a
knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a
lot of academic ground to cover to graduate.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,
5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.

The Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of
them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent
Young of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of
Houston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony
Wright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of
Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,
Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey
Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and
Lindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool
of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
If the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four
top players on my 25-man ""difference-maker"" list.
They already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.
1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.
If Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the
leader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.
The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at
kicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the
best I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five
yards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.
* * * *
INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many
years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. Consider this item
in last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50
national  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled ""8
Players to watch:
""Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something
special.""

Game Quotes . .

""We were able to spread the field today because (tight end) Bo Scaife made
some great catches and that opened things up. I think Bo gives us the ability
to stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the
defense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris
(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half.""
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on
the ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting
some three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it
up. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai
Pearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin
Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we
decided to give him the primary coverage on him.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our
offensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told
me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep
running and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the
record book.""
- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he
is the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at
Texas
* * * *
""I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was
getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and
our wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to
them.""
- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones
for 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns
* * * *
""We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA
(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day.""
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
""When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the
Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game
came as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS.""
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams
* * * *
""He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen
this year.""
- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin
Jammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards

Key Statistics

Missouri had 10 possessions and five of them were three-and-out series, while
another gained only four yards in four plays and ended with an interception.
The Tigers also started both halves with terrible offensive statistics,
making zero first downs in the first quarter and one first down in the third
quarter.

Scouting Baylor

Texas will play at Baylor at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a game that will be
televised by Fox Syndication.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 5  in both polls, are 7-1, while the Bears are 2-5.
Texas is a 34-point favorite.
Baylor has lost five straight after opening the season with a 24-3 victory
over Arkansas State and a 16-13 win over New Mexico.
The Bears then lost to Iowa State, 41-0; Texas A&M 16-10; Nebraska, 48-7;
Oklahoma, 33-17, and Texas Tech, 63-19.
QB Greg Cicero, a former Longhorn, is the Bears' main offensive threat
As you can see from the teams' respective national rankings below, Baylor has
had trouble running the ball. There are 115 Division 1 teams playing football
and the Bears are 113th in rushing and also 113th in total offense and 112th
in scoring.
The Baylor defense has been tough at times, particulary in the 16-10 loss to
A&M.
But this is a game the Longhorns should win easily. Look for RB Cedric Benson
to extend his UT true freshman record of three straight 100-yard rushing
games to four and look for QB Chris Simms to have a great day.
It also should be a good day for the Longhorn defense to get back in the top
10 nationally.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                    Baylor
Offense
(42)     169.1       Rushing Avg.        (113)    79.9
(43)     236.1       Passing Avg.         (86)   176.4
(42)     405.2      Total Off. Avg.     (113)  256.3
(7)        38        Scoring Avg         (112)    10.3
Defense
(12)       96        Rushing Avg.         (88)   194
(8)       163.1      Passing Avg.          85)   238.3
(4)       259.1     Total Def. Avg.       (94)   432.3
(6)        13.5  Opp. Scoring Avg          (92)   31

Longhorn Notes . .

Starting guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes sprained an ankle in practice last week and
was held out of the Missouri game. Coach Mack Brown said Derrick Dockery and
Tillman Holloway played well at guard. ""We have three really good guards,"" he
said.
* * * *
QB Chris Simms climbed into fourth place on the Longhorn list for touchdown
passes. He has 28 after throwing four against Missouri. He passed Shea Morenz
and Bobby Layne, who had 24 each. Peter Gardere is in third place with 37.
Major Applewhite holds the school record with 58 career touchdown passes.
* * * *
WR Roy Williams had five receptions and a touchdown pass to move into 10th
and 5th places, respectively, in the UT career charts.

In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Subject:	URM Opening


We currently have an opening(s) in the Utility Risk Management (URM) group reporting to Steve Swain.  Based upon the candidate skill level, the opening(s) will be at the Specialist, Sr. Specialist or Analyst level.

Responsibilities will include:
Building and maintaining forward price curves for a number of utility tariff rates across the WSCC.
Tracking and analyzing URM's portfolio of retail positions.
Preparing daily reports for management that analyze various factors contributing to changes in positions, P/L, hedges, etc.
Performing research and analysis on legislative and regulatory changes that could impact our price cuves and/or positions.
Working closely with the Retail Gen desk to coordinate activities involved in managing EWS's overall retail position.
Research to support the development of effective hedging strategies for the various risk exposures inherent to the URM book.

The ideal candidate(s) will possess sound Excel modeling skills (including at least superficial knowledge of Visual Basic), some familiarity with database systems and/or experience collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, excellent organizational skills, and a solid understanding of financial statements.  While some experience with regulated tariffs and utility cost of service modeling would be helpful, it is not necessary.

For those interested in learning more about the position, or about URM in general, Steve Swain and Gordon Savage will be hosting a Brown Bag Info  Session on Friday, 10/5 from 12-1 PM in Mt. Hood.
 
If you are interested in this opportunity, please let Julie Kearney know by close of business on Friday 10/5.

"YOU HAVE 48 HOURS - Message from Louise Kitchen","

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"Bike Commute Challenge","In case you are interested, the results of the Bike Commute Challenge were given last night at the Bike Commute Hubbub. Enron placed Second behind REI of Jantzen Beach. The stats were not given, but when Heather gets back, I am sure that she can get this information and pass it on.

Thanks for everyone's participation! Lets take first NEXT YEAR!

"Melissa's baby!","Hey, just wanted to let you know that Melissa was induced this morning and
baby Lauren should be here sometime later this afternoon.  I'm not sure if
you are on her email list but I will forward any pictures I get on to you.
Hope you had a good weekend, sounds like you're definitely living the high
life with all the single girls!  How fun!  :)
I, on the other hand, am picking out baby furniture & decorations....crazy
isn't it?
Well, take care and I'll talk with you soon.

Attached is the 2002 zone map that the ERCOT board approved.

Doug,  This one can replace the three zone map that you have on the ""white board"" on the floor.  I'm not sure of the new traders that have been added, so if you could please forward it to them.

David, I have forwarded this so that you know ERCOT is the original source.

"Open Enrollment for Benefits","			Open Enrollment for your 2002 Health Benefits begins Monday, October 29, 2001!  

Q. 	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A. 	If you plan to make changes to your existing benefit coverage, you will need to make changes during Open Enrollment which begins 	Monday, October 29, 2001 at 8:00 AM (Central) and ends on November 12, 2001 at 5:00 PM (Central)
	
	To facilitate these changes, you received an Open Enrollment Benefit Packet at your home address.  This packet contains a personalized 	worksheet and the Enron Instruction Guide to help you make your selections.  
	(If you have not received your Info Packet, please let us know ASAP! ) 


Q.	WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
	1.  If you are satisfied with your current elections and do not need to make changes, do nothing.  Your current choices will automatically roll 	over to 2002. 

	2.  If you plan to make changes to your coverage, you will need to either access the Intranet website at work:  benefits.enron.com    
	or at home at  www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com   or call the Phone Enrollment Line at (800) 332-7979, Option 5.


Q. 	I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.  I NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
A.	If you have more questions or need more information, you may attend our Open Enrollment ""Brown Bag"" Info Session being held on Friday, 	October 26 @ 11:30 PM in the Mt Hood Conference Room.  

See you then!

Just wanted to give you a heads up on Arco.  They have been in a maintenance outage for the past 3 weeks, and they might come back up sometime Tuesday evening (10/23) or Wednesday morning (10/24).  If they do, they will have approximately 26mw to sell into the market, in SP15.

"RE: Disaster Relief Efforts","In just a few days we have collected $400, that equals $1200 after the Enron match!  We will be accepting donations tomorrow at the picnic and again on Monday.

Please see me if you have any questions regarding the match or charities.

Thank you for your generosity.  

Mollie


In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>
NY Police and Fire Widows & Children Benefit Fund,  <http://www.nypfwc.org/>

"Revised EOL Download - PLEASE USE","I believe all the bugs have been worked out of this one. It pulls in inter-desk swaps and includes all the features you guys have requested - sorts by delivery point or hour, able to refresh, etc.

I've saved the download as EOL Download (in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000) and deleted the file called NEW EOL DOWNLOAD. Test is out and let me know what you think.

Thanks.

"EPE Lending for 9/28","We're lending again.....

The STSW desk will be 20 mw short per the El Paso lending agreement, on peak @ 4C-345kv. The day-ahead sale price is $27.05. Please purchase to cover this position under the STWHOURLY desk and complete an inter-desk sale to STSW to tie out our positions. 

PLEASE NOTE: INTER-DESK SWAPS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANNUITIES. YOU CANNOT NET THE DAY'S VOLUME AND SWAP OUT AT ONLY ONE HOUR. YOU MUST BUY AND SELL THE SAME AMOUNT EACH HOUR TO REMAIN AT ZERO EACH HOUR.

It's been awhile since we've done this, so here's a reminder of the procedure. Once you've purchased to cover this short in the real time market, you must sell back to El Paso @ $0 to keep our position net zero. Then reduce the day-ahead purchase price from El Paso (794022) to $2 to cover the lending service fee.

Please, please, please ask me if you have ANY questions about how to do this.

"Short/Long Positions for 10/18","For Thursday -

STWBOM will be short 75 mw on peak @ SP15. The three day-ahead pieces were sold @ $27.20 and $28 (BOM sales) and $29.97 (SP15 Peak Day-Ahead Index).

Make real time purchases to cover the short under the STWHOURLY book. Enter an inter-desk sale from STWHOURLY to STWBOM. Then make a sale under the STWBOM book to the Cal-Imbalance to complete the deal.

Also, STWBOM will be long 20 mw HE 2-5 @ PV. This is a parking deal with PNM done at $16 ($14 purchase price + $2 buy-resale fee). You'll notice we'll be long 20 mw for these hours in Real Time Position Manager. Please enter an inter-desk purchase from STWBOM under the STWHOURLY book @ PV and sell this off real time under STWHOURLY. 

Let me know if you have questions.

"2001 Chairman's Award Deadline Extension","Many of you have requested more time in which to submit your nominations for the 2001 Chairman's Award. In response to your requests, the deadline has been extended to Friday, October 12.

Please take this extended opportunity to nominate that special individual who is your everyday hero and a role model who exemplifies Enron's core values of Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence.

This award represents how important Enron's core values are to the company. The success of this award program is determined by Enron's most valuable asset, you, the employee. Employees at any level can nominate fellow employees from anywhere within the Enron family - from the top down or the bottom up. All of those employees who have been nominated in the past are eligible to be nominated again this year and there is no limit to the number of nominations you may submit. Simply complete a nomination form and submit it by Friday, October 12, 2001. Forms can be obtained by visiting your intranet site or at home.enron.com and in Houston they are available in the elevator lobbies. In addition, this year we have a new way you can nominate that everyday Enron hero. Simply pick up the phone and dial 713-345-2492, follow the simple and quick instructions and leave your nomination by phone.

The finalists for the award, the Chairman's Roundtable, and the Chairman's Award winner will be honored at Enron's Management Conference in San Antonio on November 15.

Thank you for your participation.

"Update","
As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.  Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.  As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.  

In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.  At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.  Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.  Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs. 

We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.  This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.

I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.  Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.  All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.

Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.  We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.  As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.  Thank you.

Ken

We are short at PGE system for 9/21/01 and 9/22/01.  HE15-20pdt, we are 25mw short.  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  The sale deal number has not yet been input to the system, but I will send another note when it has.

Also, I failed to send a note for TODAY, 09/20/01.  We are short at Portland System for 8mw HE1-6, 23-34 and 25mw for HE15-20.  I was able to call RT in time for them to cover this morning.  LLH deal number is 781575.1 and Super peak number is 781576.1.  Sorry about the lapse for this one.


Thanks, 
Donald Robinson, NW preschedule desk

"Parking and Lending with ST-NW","Group,

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. 

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,
Bill

We are short at PGE system for Wednesday, 10/17/01.  HE1-6, 23-24pdt, we are 13mw short (total of 104mw).  This is due to a lending deal done by the NW Cash desk.  Please supply Portland at their system in the most cost effective manner possible.  Deal #821995.1

"Time Change","Group,
As most of you are aware we changed time zones on Sunday. We are back in Pacific Standard Time. As such, we are once again in a different time zone than some of our counterparties. Please specify Pacific time zone in your summary of your deal at the end of each phone call--translate the deal to Mountain time only if necessary. We must be very clear on this going forward or disputes will be numerous and we will not be able to resolve them. See me if you have any questions regarding this expectation.
Thanks,

Bill

"New EOL Download - PLEASE USE","FYI -

We have a new tool at our disposal to assist in the transfer of EOL information from Enpower to the Inc sheets. I've saved it as the ""EOL Download"" in P://Real Time/Increment/Windows 2000/EOL Download.

You can use this workbook to download EOL deals throughout the day. It's fairly self-explanatory, but here are a few suggestions:

1. If necessary, limit your query to one region using the boxes in the upper-left-hand corner.
2. Click ""Download Deals,"" and enter your Enpower password when prompted. Be sure to check that you are downloading for the current day.
3. Once deals have populated the screen (should take no more than 30-45 seconds), filter for the hour and/or delivery point you need.
4. Copy all relevant rows and paste directly into the appropriate Inc sheet.

This sheet has just enough flexibility to make it functional and keep it simple. All it does is download EOL deals from Enpower - nothing more. If you'd like to see this expanded upon, feel free to give me suggestions.

Thanks.

"FW: EPE Lending for 9/28","REVISION:

PLEASE CHANGE THE PRICE ON DAY-AHEAD EL PASO PURCHASE (794022) TO $2.25 - THIS WILL COVER OUR LENDING SERVICE FEE AS WELL AS OUR NEGOTIATED SCHEDULING FEE WITH EL PASO.

THANK YOU.

Subject:	EPE Lending for 9/28

We're lending again.....

The STSW desk will be 20 mw short per the El Paso lending agreement, on peak @ 4C-345kv. The day-ahead sale price is $27.05. Please purchase to cover this position under the STWHOURLY desk and complete an inter-desk sale to STSW to tie out our positions. 

PLEASE NOTE: INTER-DESK SWAPS ARE NOT THE SAME AS ANNUITIES. YOU CANNOT NET THE DAY'S VOLUME AND SWAP OUT AT ONLY ONE HOUR. YOU MUST BUY AND SELL THE SAME AMOUNT EACH HOUR TO REMAIN AT ZERO EACH HOUR.

It's been awhile since we've done this, so here's a reminder of the procedure. Once you've purchased to cover this short in the real time market, you must sell back to El Paso @ $0 to keep our position net zero. Then reduce the day-ahead purchase price from El Paso (794022) to $2 to cover the lending service fee.

Please, please, please ask me if you have ANY questions about how to do this.

Volume 12, No. 3, October 29, 2001

 Simms Throws 4 TD Passes, Benson Rushes
For 157 Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers, 35-16

Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had career-best days
and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and
third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a 35-16 victory.
On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10,
and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care
of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12.
With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are
all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South.
But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference
game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game.
Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the
stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed
Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and
Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a pop.
But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going.
On their first drive, for example, they held the ball almost 10 minutes,
rolling 78 yards in 19 plays, but they got zero points because they stalled
at the Tiger 2 and Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.
They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession, but again
stalled.
Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first.
That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out
the Missouri defenders.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran
the UT kick back to the 38. The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out
and the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78
yards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty
Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal. Missouri went three-and-out again.
The Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended. Texas
had a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24
edge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but
the game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.
Second Quarter
The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter
and drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0
lead with 11:12 left. Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the
Longhorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up. Simms connected with WR B.
J. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms
to TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32. Mangum's kick tied it,
7-7, with 5:44 left. After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and
got a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard
gain to the MU 13. A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more
and a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock
Edwards for the final 3 yards and the TD. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7
lead with 1:50 left. The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two
minutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained
37 yards in three carries. His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the
Tigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw
two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut
the UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left. The Tigers outgained the Longhorns
in the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.
Third Quarter
Texas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time
it counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum
converted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left. the Longhorns overcame a
third-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin
for 24 yards. Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns
great field position at the MU 48. The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick
kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and
allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was
dominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.  The Tigers made
only one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs
on that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.
Fourth Quarter
The Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to
Abron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD. Missouri's pass
for a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.
Not to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4
before Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25
yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16
lead with 4:27 left.

Texas and the BCS

The next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different
from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot
higher than it was in the last one.
In the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked
No. 6 behind five teams with perfect records. The BCS standings are like golf
in that the lowest score is the best score.
Oklahoma came in at No. 1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by
Nebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas
at 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.
But a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.
Since OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should
pass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the
Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.
Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are
guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange,
Fiesta and Sugar.
The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year. Right now, that
looks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left
before making that date.
Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets,
like Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.
But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep
winning.

Key Games for BCS Watchers

If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape
in one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their
final three regular season games.
Assuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the
season:
This Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre
Dame and UCLA at Washington State.
The big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and
UCLA at Oregon.
On Nov. 17, Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma, Syracuse is at Miami, Michigan is at
Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia.
On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan hosts Ohio State, Nebraska goes to Colorado
and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma.
The big games on Dec. 1 are Miami at Virginia Tech, Tennessee at Florida and
Oregon State at at Oregon.
If Oklahoma loses to A&M, Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out, Texas would
qualify for the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 8.
The final BCS rankings will be released on December 9, the day after the Big
12 and Southeastern Conference have their championship games.
Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released
today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where
the Horns wind up.

Jackson, McClintock to Redshirt

It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O. J. McClintock will
redshirt.
Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said
last week there are no plans to play them.
He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg. He said
McClintock won't play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE.

Coach's Corner

The Longhorns, now ranked No. 5 in both polls after a rash of upsets
Saturday, are playing well, but they need to keep working to get better, head
coach Mack Brown said Sunday.
After studying films of the 35-16 victory over Missouri, Brown said he and
his assistants were generally pleased with the team's play.
But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week. ""We weren't
pleased with out tackling,"" Brown said. ""We weren't pleased one back gained
over 100 yards on us. We've got to get back to work on that.""
He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into
the red zone only three times all day ""but they scored all three times.
That's not what we want.""
The offense played a pretty good game, he said, adding that tackle Mike
Wiliams ""played great. He's our offensive player of the week.""
Defensively, he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer, who held
the Tiger's nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for 14 yards.
He was averaging 7.5 receptions per game and ranked second in the Big 12 in
that department.
Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game. ""We
kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs,"" he said. ""We've got some issues
there we've got to correct.""
He said backup LB Reed Boyd, who plays on several of the kicking teams, ""was
our special teams player of the week.""
Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two, against Baylor
and Kansas, when the opponents are losing and struggling, he said, ""Baylor
played A&M and Oklahoma tough. Our guys need to play football because they
like playing it. If they can't get excited about playing football, they don't
need to be playing football at the University of Texas.""
He also said, ""Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them
off.""

"Important Information About Security & ClickAtHome","
Dear ClickAtHome Participant,

ClickAtHome is interested in making sure you have the latest security tools available to you.  As part of the ClickAtHome program, you may download and update Norton Anti-Virus and BlackICE Defender software from the ClickAtHome Portal.  

Norton AntiVirus software repairs computer virus infections automatically.  It scans and cleans your hard drive, diskettes and both incoming and outgoing email.  
BlackICE Defender is an industrial-strength anti-hacker system that protects your PC by scanning your DSL, cable modem, or dial-up Internet connection looking for hacker activity. When it detects an attempted intrusion, it automatically blocks traffic from that source, keeping intruders from accessing your system. 
By installing and updating both Norton AntiVirus and BlackICE Defender, your ClickAtHome PC will have the latest security offered by these two products.  
Instructions for accessing the Portal and downloading the software are provided below.
If you have any questions or wish to provide feedback, please email clickathome@enron.com.  Thank you for your participation in ClickAtHome.
The ClickAtHome Team!

"RE: S&P's downgrade of Enron to Junk Status (B-)","
12:24 28Nov2001 RSF-WRAPUP 1-Enron near collapse after Dynegy pulls out

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. <ENE.N> hovered on the brink of one of the biggest corporate collapses in U.S. history on Wednesday as its rescue by rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> fell apart.
    Dynegy accused Enron of breaching the representations it made when the takeover agreement was negotiated on Nov. 9, invoking an escape clause that let it pull out of the deal.
    Shares of Enron, recently ranked No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of the biggest U.S. companies, had already lost most of their value and all three major credit rating agencies had slashed their ratings on Enron's bonds to junk status by the time Dynegy made its announcement.
    The loss of investment-grade credit forces some $3.9 billion in debts to off-balance sheet partnerships to come due immediately, a major problem for a company that has spent most of the $5.5 billion it sought in recent weeks to stay afloat.
    It became increasingly clear, as Dynegy sought to renegotiate the deal, that Enron's complex and often indecipherable financial books were becoming a sticking point, sources close to the negotiations said.
    ""While it is regrettable to see a leading industry player in difficulties, this does not reflect a failure of the merchant energy business,"" Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Chuck Watson said in a statement.
    Dynegy said it would exercise its option to buy Enron's Northern Natural Gas Pipeline with the $1.5 billion it and partner ChevronTexaco <CHV.X> put into the deal.
    A bad sign came earlier on Wednesday, as energy traders said operations had stopped at Enron's once highly lucrative online trading system, EnronOnline. The unit accounted for up to 90 percent of Enron's earnings, and was considered the jewel of the trading franchise that Dynegy coveted most in its planned $9.3 billion all-stock takeover.
    Enron, which touted itself as an agile risk manager, found its credit and debt had spiraled out of control as a series of partnerships designed to hide debt off of its balance sheet caused investors to lose faith in recent weeks.
    The partnerships, which included top Enron executives and are the subject of a U.S. Securities and Exchange investigation, provided financing in exchange for guarantees that Enron's stock stay above certain levels and its credit remain investment-grade.
    Enron shares plunged $2.95, or 71.3 percent, to $1.19, before the New York Stock Exchange halted trading ahead of Dynegy's announcement. They have fallen more than 98 percent this year.
    The stock peaked at $90.56 in August 2000, riding high on the cresting wave of the technology boom after Enron took its trading outfit online and promised to bring its business model into the broadband communications arena.
    ""They (Enron) entrapped the sophisticates,"" said Robert Stovall, senior strategist at Prudential Securities, referring to what was once an almost fawning admiration for Enron by institutional investors. ""I think this is going to become a classic case.""
    Stovall, with nearly 50 years of working on Wall Street, said he could not recall any previous corporate unravelling that matches that of Enron.
    ""You would have to go to pre-SEC days for that,"" he said, referring to the creation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the aftermath of the stock-market crash of 1929.

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

"Disaster Relief Efforts","In an effort to support our fellow citizens during this time of disaster we will be collecting donations for relief efforts in NY, DC and PA.
A designated collection box has been placed by the lobby area.  All donations will be double matched by Enron.

If we all donated what we have would spent on the complimentary lunch today or what we would spend on coffee tomorrow, matched double by Enron, it would really add up.  The money will be sent on Monday, September 24.

The funds will be donated to the following organizations, please pay by cash or check payable to an organization listed below or a relief organization of your choice.  We will take care of the appropriate matching donation forms.

United Way Sept 11th Fund, <http://september11fund.org/>
American Red Cross Disaster Relief, <http://www.redcross.org/>

"STCA Hour24 Schedule, 10/10/01","A hour ahead 24 has been sent to the ISO for 10.10.01.

HE 13-20

APX1 SP15 purchase increased by 25 MW
STCA SDG1 load decreased by 25MW

This was due to a scheduling problem which occurred with BPs (SC ID APX1) sale to STCA on 10.09.01
They preferred to schedule their sale hour ahead and we have agreed.  This will be a one time arrangement.  Thanks, Serena

"Morrow Power","Group,

Morrow Power came on line today to sell 24mw, for 24 hours, for testing.  They began, Thursday, 10/4, HE13, and will run through HE12 on Friday, 10/5.  Please sell for the best price possible.  You will also need to call in to BPA numbers desk, transmission,  and real-time (just like you did for Grays Harbor and Frontier).

Also, BPA has been calling a few times today to ask us to schedule losses for control area reserves from Morrow, Grays Harbor, and Frontier.  If they call again, please tell them that we are not responsible for the scheduling of Grays Harbor any more, and we are working on dispute resolutions for Morrow and Frontier.  Once we get the resolutions worked out, and if we still owe them losses, then we will return them at that time.

Thanks,

Bill,

We are looking for EPMI West real time to provide coverage for Enron Canada Corp. on Friday, September 21 and Sunday, September 23 from 7 AM to 7 PM (MPT). ECC will be looking for EPMI to dispatch the plant if necessary and to inform the Power Pool of Alberta of a change in availability. ECC will forward the real-time number to Portland and will also provide a cell phone number if you have any questions. 

Let me know if you have any questions,

Thanks in advance,

Bill

"Changing Deals and Counterparties--","
Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a ""Canadian"" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

Thanks, 
Bill

"Quick Reminders - PLEASE READ","FYI -

1. Please do not ever, under any circumstances, modify EOL deals in any way. These deals have an embedded contract in them which is created at the moment a counterparty hits your bid or lifts your offer. Also, EOL deals may not be extended in Deal Scheduling.

2. When entering deals to account for ancillary services (i.e. deals with no fixed price, only demand charge price), please make any changes or extensions in Deal Entry rather than Deal Scheduling. Demand charge price is not accounted for when the deal is only extended in Scheduling.

Let me know if you have questions about either of these reminders. Thanks for reading this all the way through.

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A ""meltdown"" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"New EOL Download - PLEASE READ","FYI -

I've had a few requests for changes to and enhancements of the EOL Download sheet. Dan Maxwell - of the 4th floor IT group - sent me those changes today. The download now allows you to sort by delivery point, or by hour, and has an added ""refresh"" feature. The date has also been reformatted to fit into our inc sheets (two digit instead of four digit year). Most importantly, the query now pulls in inter-desk swaps done on EOL.

The new EOL download is saved in p://real time/increment/windows 2000/NEW EOL DOWNLOAD

The sheet is still very basic and self-explanatory, so if you have anything to add, or questions about how to use it, please let me know.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Dahlke, Andrea  
Sent:	Monday, November 19, 2001 2:33 PM
To:	Allen, Thresa A.; Smith, Katina
Cc:	Dean, Clint
Subject:	LCRA modification

Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which affected the following deals:

275298	Jan-00			modified option premium
288187		Feb-00			modified option premium
300368	Mar-00			modified option premium
316345		Apr-00			modified option premium
331019		May-00			modified option premium
347153		Jun-00			modified option premium
425790	Dec-00 through Feb-01 modified annuity strips
397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips

What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed through to your systems?  Does everything prior to the current month need to be auto-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?

Thanks!

Andrea

"SEC Information/Earnings Restatement","
Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

"Happy hour policy","
This information was sent by Tim Belden and Chris Calger earlier in the year. I am sending it again for the benefit of our new hires and as a reminder to be responsible while enjoying this evening's event.

============

Over the last couple of years we have had numerous social events including holiday parties, post-quarterly meeting outings, and going away parties. While I hope that people thoroughly enjoy themselves, I ask that you keep in mind that we all have to act professionally and responsibly during and after these events. I have been working with Chris Calger and Amy FitzPatrick to put together some guidelines for company-sponsored social events:

The company will provide soft drinks, beer and wine. You may choose to order other beverages at your expense.
Functions will run for a specified period of time. If there is an open bar, we will establish a time certain after which Enron will not pay for any additional drinks.
If you require assistance getting home, please contact a taxi and submit the fare for expense reimbursement with no questions asked. The last thing in the world we want is to have people break the law or put their safety and the safety of others in jeopardy.

============

PLEASE NOTE: We now have cab vouchers available for our company events. Please check with your admin assistant to obtain a voucher, or see me at the event--no questions asked.

Thanks,
Grace

"RE: Fall 2001 Camping Trip","I'm impressed.  I'm starting to get calls/emails asking if we are still on.
Usually you guys don't plan anything until one hour before.  So, I
congratulate you all on this big step.

We are on for December 7 and 8.

In any event, this is the final list of people that are definitely coming.
We are at 15 counting the email list above plus two additional people that
Palmer is bringing.  Paul Park's room-mate may be coming as well.

Remember to get directions for the website below before you head out.  BTW,
the directions are pretty iffy.  So, you will want to look at a map before
you get in your car.  Also, cell phones don't work too well out there, so
don't try to rely on calling us once you get lost.

What to bring:  Bedding is supplied.  But we now have 15 people potentially
in on this thing.  If memory serves, the house can sleep 15 and bedding
should be available.  I think 5 people should plan on bringing the
just-in-case sleeping bag.  I'll bring one.  That leaves 4 others for you
all to decide.  Bring all your booze and ice for the weekend and cups to
drink out of.  It's next to impossible to find this stuff out there.  You
also want to bring your baffroom stuff and warm clothes for drinking outside
at night.   You will also want lighter (not summer) clothes for daytime
stuff.  There's fishing/country golf/hiking available in the area.  So,
bring what equipment you want to.  Each car should bring a cooler with ice
in it.  You also will want your food for the weekend.  Bring what you want,
but popular meals are steaks at night and sandwiches during the day.  I
specifically like to get steak blood all over my face and chase
vegetarian-Summitt around.  Mostly, you shouldn't need to bring too much.

Cost:  Plan on about $40 for the cabin per person.  Plan on another $20 per
person for firewood.  This has gone up because we're buying lots and towing
it down.  Stupid...yes.  Fun...yes.  You may also want to have a little more
just-in-case cash.

When to arrive.  The hills are pretty difficult driving at night, and if you
haven't ever been before, the cabin itself is difficult to find at night.
So, if at all possible, try to get a half-day off or so on Friday to get you
out there by sundown on Friday night.  You may want to call the cabin office
and get specific directions before-hand regardless of what time you plan on
arriving.  We will likely leave somewhat early on Sunday.

Palmer, can you bring lanterns, lantern fuel, etc.  Clint/Koppa, can you
bring a case of Duraflam logs (yes, we cheat)?  Summitt and I will be towing
the trailer down.  Palmer, you may want to grab a little firewood that day
if we are running late.

I hope this answers everything.  Let me know if it does not.  Looking
forward to it.

"Market Changes","Group,

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent ""swinging"" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

Bill

"APS Line Loss Payback","FYI -

We will be paying back line losses to APS tomorrow @ 4C - 1 mw @ HE 6, 1 mw @ HE 11. I've gone ahead and prescheduled this payback to ensure that it gets tagged. All you have to do is make sure this makes it into the El Paso model (EPE is the source). Following are the deal and tag numbers, just in case.....

Deals - 800427/800467
Tag - 34307

Again, no need to do anything for this. Just put in in the model. And let me know if you have questions.

"RE:","How was your Thanksgiving in Dallas?  I had a great time in San Antonio!
Especially Friday after Texas won!  Not the best game played, but we
beat them!  How is the new building?  Glad to hear the rumors have
stopped.  That can be so stressful.  Hope all is well with you.  I work
nights this week (imagine that?).  Coming back after two weeks off is
always so HARD!

What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has
happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the
rumors
have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not
sure
how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger
will
get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So
there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As
far
as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they
bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little
better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are
supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will
be
interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.

      I definitely dressed up for the party.  I looked good!  I was a
   sheriff.
      If you can't find that CD up there, you can always pick it up
   back in
      Texas.  So, I'm trying to remember, does your mom live in
   Houston, and dad
      in S.A.?  Is that right?  I'm going to Dallas for Thanksgiving,
   and I'm
      just glad I don't have to fly.  I can't imagine what the lines
   will be like
      that week.  I'm off work this Friday, so if you get a chance to
   call,
      better make it Thursday.  Glad to hear that you're feeling
   better.  Talk to
      you soon.

         Hey there!  How was your Halloween party?  Did you dress up?
   I hung out
         with some friends, but no costumes.  Dexter Freebish - that's
   it.  I'll
         have to look for it up here.  We went to the APB party, but
   left early
         to get some food.  Things calmed down that last night
   compared to
         Tuesday.

         I'll be back on days at the end of next week and then I'll
   have two
         weeks off.  I cannot wait!  What are your plans for
   Thanksgiving?  I'm
         flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days.  I
   can't decide
         whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas.
   I feel so
         lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

         I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
   lost my
         voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
   Needless
         to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
   everyone was
         happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
   other than
         the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

         Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
   office on
         Thursday.

            back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for
   the band
         I was
            playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there,
   but it
         was
            probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from
   Austin.
         You need
            to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a
   Halloween
         party this
            weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you
         planning any
            more trips back to Houston?

            Clint

            Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the
   second
         night,
            but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a
   lot of
         people
            had early flights out the next morning.

            This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!
   Or
         at least
            some sleep.

            What was the name of that band you were playing in your
   car?  I
         doubt I
            can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

            Have a great weekend!

                 Jennifer,
                 I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't
   get to
         meet
            up the
                 second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you
   go
         out
            again on
                 Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I
   guess
         I
            missed you.
                 Talk to you soon.

                 Clint

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

"Update","This morning Enron's credit rating was downgraded to junk status which is below investment grade.  This is very bad news for Enron's future prospects. 

The flurry of activity that you see from the trading and scheduling team is a direct result of our credit downgrade.  Many of our contracts have provisions that allow our customers to stop performing on their contracts with us if Enron's credit rating falls below investment grade and if we are unable to post sufficient collateral.  The trading, scheduling, and legal team are working together to figure out how to meet our physical delivery obligations over the next several weeks.  This is our number one priority right now.

 I will still be holding the floor meeting at 1 PM today.  I would like to hold the meeting earlier but am not sure that I will be able to do so.  I know that people are very concerned about our ever-worsening status.  I know that you want information as soon as possible.  If I am able to meet before 1 PM I will send out an e-mail announcing an earlier meeting.

Tim

"Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy","
Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"What does AG mean?","As in UBS AG:
AG means the same thing as ""incorporated"" or ""inc.""

From a German dictionary:
AG [a  ge ]
(pl. -, -s) (f) (abbr) (= Aktiengesellschaft) plc (Brit);corp. (US);inc. (US).


For those interested in more German:

"Morrow Power","Real Time Traders,

Morrow Power wants to take their unit to the market to get some run time before they begin selling Firm energy. So I'd like the Real Time group to sell the unit at the best price in the hourly market. 

I've already bought gas for Friday and Saturday operations. I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday. 

To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price. 

To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.

Also, I've bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour. 

I'll be out this afternoon and tomorrow and Stan will be standing in for me. I'll be available on my cell phone for any questions.

Les

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Game Quotes . .

""We actually had an Aggie block. We'd worked on it all week, but it wasn't
working, so we went back to our regular block ande I just had to beat the guy
in front of me. When I saw it was a linebacker, I knew he was in trouble.
Linebackers aren't quick enough to block me. If I can't get by a big old guy
like that, I don't deserve my scholarship.""
- Longhorn cornerback Rod Babers, who blocked the punt that resulted in UT's
first-quarter touchdown
* * * *
""We were both on the right side (he and Babers) and they weren't zone
blocking like we do. They were in man-for-man, and all we had to do was beat
the guy in front of us. That's my first touchdown as a special teams player.""
- Texas wide receiver Tony Jeffery, who scooped up the ball Babers blocked
and ran it in for the game's first touchdown
* * * *
""We did a good job against the run. I thought Maurice Gordon probably played
as good as he's every played for us. Their center (All-Big 12 Seth McKinney)
is a good ball player and at times he couldn't block him. I thought all our
guys played pretty well today. This was a good old-fashioned football game,
with both teams playing good defense, and a break or two deciding the
outcome.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""We felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there, we'd
eventually get the running game going, and Cedric (Benson) and the offensive
line did a great job in the fourth quarter. With Cedric, you don't have to
abandon the running game because you know he'll break loose sooner or later.
We didn't want to take too many chances and give them a short field because
we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense
playing so well.""
 - Texas defensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""It never got easier, but it did get better. I think our linemen finally wore
them down and I started getting a little more room. It would have been nice
to get 1,000 yards, but winning the game is the main thing, and we did that.""
 - Texas running back Cedric Benson
* * * *
""Give the Longhorns some credit. Their defense is really good. It ranks with
any we have seen this year.""
- A&M quarterback Mark Farris
* * * *
""The game was up for grabs in the fourth quarter. They just made some plays.
It was 7-7 and they did what they had to do in the fourth quarter to go up,
14-7. They have some great offensive weapons, and we held them in check for
most of the game.""
- A&M head coach R. C. Slocum

It will be televised nationally by ABC and it should be a good one. Texas is
an 8-point favorite.
The Longhorns mauled the Buffaloes, 41-7, on Oct. 20 in Austin, but that
Colorado team bore little resemblance to the one that hung a 62-36 lashing on
No. 1-ranked Nebraska Saturday.
For starters, Bobby Pesavento, who passed for 202 yards against Nebraska, got
his first start against Texas and he looked like a first-time starter.
He was a poised, confident sharpshooter Saturday against Nebraska, the
perfect complement for the Buffs' power running game that produced 380 yards
and eight rushing touchdowns against the proud Blackshirt defense of Nebraska.
Sophomore Chris Brown scored a school record six rushing touchdowns while
rushing for 198 yards. He had 26 yards against Texas in October.
 Colorado is 9-2. It's only losses were 24-22 in the season opener with
Fresno State and the one at Texas. The nine victories were 41-14 over
Colorado State, 51-15 over San Jose State, 27-16 over Kansas, 16-6 over
Kansas State, 31-21 over Texas A&M, 22-19 over giant-killer Oklahoma State,
38-24 over Missouri, 40-27 over Iowa State and, of course, the big one over
Nebraska.
Texas won the first game against Colorado by using four first-half turnovers
to take a 24-7 lead and force the Buffaloes the abandon their running game
and try to play catchup.
In that game, Colorado had 244 yards offensively in the first half, but was
stymied by a fumble at the UT 4 on first-and goal, a fumble at the CU 21 that
set up a Texas field goal, and another fumble at the Buff 35 that set up
another UT touchdown.
Unless history repeats and the Horns force more early turnovers, this game
will be a terrific challenge for Texas.
I think there are three keys to a UT victory:
1. Win the turnover battle again.
2. Keep balance between running and passing, but challenge the Buffs suspect
pass defense frequently.
3. Slow down Colorado's power running game, which ranks No. 9 nationally at
229 yards a game.

completed17 of 28 passes for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns, and freshman RB
Cedric Benson had 23 carries for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Longhorn
defense gave up 244 yards in the first half, but forced four game-turning
turnovers.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown has told his team and Longhorn fans all season that good
things happen to teams who keep winning.
After a mid-season loss to Oklahoma, the Longhorns have reeled off six
straight wins, and Oklahoma State's stunning upset of Oklahoma Saturday gave
Texas the Big 12 Southern Division title.
""Obviously,"" he said, ""we are excited about it because it proves to our guys
that when people questioned whether their season was over after the Oklahoma
game, that it wasn't.""
""They realized that what they needed to do was take care of their business
and there might be some good things that happen at the end.""
""Our team could've taken the Missouri game or the Baylor game for granted,
but they didn't. They took care of their business every week. They didn't
worry about the BCS and now they've got themselves in position for a
championship game for the second time in three years.""
""We are really, really excited. I am proud of our team and of the way they
played at College Station. What an awful thing it would have been if we had
not taken care of business (Friday) in College Station and this would have
happened (OU's loss Saturday).""
""So, give credit to our team for being mature, playing hard and putting
themselves in position to have a rematch with Colorado.""
He also said the Longhorns' 41-7 victory over Colorado in Austin back on
October 20 means little because ""this isn't the same Colorado team we played
at mid-season.""
""Any team that can get 62 points against Nebraska gets your attention,"" he
said. "" I think it is obvious that Colorado is a great football team. They
are running the ball as good as anybody in the country right now.""
""What a great challenge it will be for our defense, which has played as good
as any defense  in the country,"" he said. ""That will be a great matchup.""
Brown said the Longhorn offense had a tough day against A&M. ""We will need to
play better on offense in this game and what a great challenge it will be to
try to stop Colorado from running the ball as well as they ran it against
Nebraska,"" he said.
Brown also said Saturday's game is huge because it is for the Big 12
Championship
""You always want to win your conference championship,"" he said. ""It is one of
your first goals each year. This is our second opportunity to win a
conference championship in four years here and are we excited.""
""The BCS is not an issue today and a bowl game is not an issue today,"" he
said. ""This is what you fight to get into, but when you get there, you've got
to win. After that, you try to look up and figure out where you are.""
But Brown said beating Colorado again is a huge challenge for the Longhorns.
""If our guys weren't convinced before the Nebraska game, we will convince
them that this Colorado team is different,"" he said.
""Give (Colorado coach)  Gary Barnett credit. He took his kids to Texas
Stadium this summer and said that is where we want to end up, and as of
(Saturday), nobody thought that Colorado and Texas would end up in this ball
game.""
""So, give both teams credit,"" Brown said. ""It is two teams that have been
down this year and have gotten themselves back up, gone back to work and are
playing as well as anyone in the country at the end of the year.""
""One of the things that we have talked about with this team is respect. You
need to respect yourself and your teammates, but you also need to respect
your opponent. Every Saturday has to be a real important game for us and a
really exciting game for us. Our guys will play hard this Saturday because
they understand what is at stake.""
""To win the conference championship in this league,"" Brown said, ""you have to
beat the same team twice a lot of the time. That is something that is just
there. To be the champion you have to do it, so we are excited about it.
There is no question that it is harder, because they will have a lot of
motivation coming in. But we are also going to have a lot of motivation
coming in to try to be the champions of the Big 12.""
He said the players and coaches are excited about the challenge.
""This is a championship game week,"" he said. ""You understand that this is 
like playing your biggest rival and that makes it fun. What we have to do to
win the championship every year is play a huge rival like Texas A&M and then
play this game the next week. We need to get used to that.""
""There are a lot of things that are different now in the Big 12 that they
were around here for a long time with the Southwest Conference. One of them
is being able to play big game after big game and especially at the end of
the year.""
""We have been here before, but we haven't taken the other step yet. This is
the week for us to take the other step and win the championship.""
""Our players are the reason why we are here. Different things have happened
throughout the year and this was just the latest one.""
""The reason we are playing in this game is our assistant coaches and our
players have worked really hard to take advantage of every opportunity that
they have had since the Oklahoma game. They never got their head down and
still believed. They kept themselves in a position to win if the opportunity
came up.""
Brown had planned a big recruiting push this week, but said, 'We will put our
recruiting on hold. All of the coaches could go out on Monday for the first
time and be in schools and the homes, but  the players out there will
understand that our recruiting will be better by winning the championship
game.""

"4 MW Sale","This confirms that EPMI Real Time will be selling 4 MW at NP-15 to Wheelabrator Martell and reducing the generation pre-schedule from 13 MW to 9 MW effective HE 17 on 9/25 through HE12 on 9/26.  We expect that Martell might need to continue this purchase through at least HE 17 on 9/26, but Dave Ferguson will call Stan or me tomorrow to clarify exactly which hours are needed.  After this event Dave can call Stan  to obtain info on the price paid.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

"Overview of Investor Conference Call","Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information. Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Building, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered ""participants in the solicitation"" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

Thanks for those that sqooshed the beans 'tween their toes, extreme cooks, dessert visionaries, dishwashers, crepe makers, beach walkers, saggers and drivers.  And oh you hill climber/bike riders...   Memory makers all! 

Remember, you can NOT get this kind of service/savings at any HOTEL  6! 

things we learned:  wasps down our shirts are painful!  If your bike is not moving you will fall.  2 wrongs (lefts?) CAN make a right!  Stop to pee on the uphill or at the top!  the 'Draft' can be a good thing.  Shootin' stars, like the truth, 'is out there'.  Ibuprofen is your friend!  Now to take a moment for your own personal thoughts... 

OK---now for the cold hard facts, a drum roll please!  Attached is the spreadsheet as it currently stands.  If there are mistakes, omissions, overages, underages...just plain bad spreadsheetin' please to tell.  If your amount is in red or not in (  ) pay the piper.  If you are in the (black) the check is in the mail!   

some easy ones, Hansel, if you'd give 20 bones to Travis then you can pay me $5 and you are clear!  Todd, 10 bones to Rachel and I'm happy to call it  square.  Cathy and Matt, save your 4 quarters for ball markers when we all walk (stagger) the links at Edgefield!  Chris and Mike, we'll handle ours when rent comes due (ok?)...if spreadsheets are not your thing see below!    

We have much to be thankful for!  Peace and thanks to all for sharing these bounties and each other!

When fall comes... 
The sun slants in so fine 
And the air's so clear 
You can almost hear the grapes grow on the vine 

The nights are sharp with starlight 
And the days are cool and clean 
And in the blue sky overhead 
The northern geese fly south instead 
And leaves are Irish Setter red 
When fall comes... 

When fall comes... 
And the wind blows off the sea 
Swallows fly in a perfect sky 
And the world was meant to be

STWBOM will be 50 mw short @ NP15. Day-ahead price is $23.67. Please purchase to cover this under STWHOURLY (make all subsequent wheels and transmission deals under STWHOURLY as well), and make an inter-desk swap between the two books. 

Off Peak, sometime between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning -

We need to pay APS for transmission line losses - 3 mw off peak @ PV. Again, please purchase to cover this under the STWHOURLY book and sell @ $0 to Arizona Public Service Co. THIS NEEDS TO BE TAGGED. PLEASE PUT NOTES IN BOTH DEALS AND THE TAG TO INDICATE POWER IS BEING USED TO PAY BACK LINE LOSSES.

As always, please let me know if you have questions.

"E-Tag 1.7 training","Good Morning,

Last Tuesday I attended the OATI training on E-Tag 1.7 in Houston.  Although this new tagging won't be implemented until March, we will have access to the Test site sometime in November or December.

This new way of tagging is very different from what we have now, and each group that makes tags is going to have to allow time for practice.  Also, because the format of the new tags is so different, the old templates will not work.  New templates will need to be created.

Please let me know if you want to have formal training sessions, and I will work up a series of them for January and February.


Thanks,

Cara

Please send them 3 mw during one heavy load hour tomorrow - losses were incurred HE 8, but may be paid back at anytime on-peak. They need the energy delivered at either PV or 4C. Make purchase and sale under STWHOURLY, and please tag this payback as well. Let me know the relevant deal & tag numbers, and I will convey these to APS.

"New Legal Team to Assist RAC","	In order to bring better legal coordination and standardization to Enron's Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) group, we have formed a new legal group, which will initially include Lisa Mellencamp (Finance), Marcus Nettelton (Power Trading), Carol St. Clair (Broadband/Power Trading), Mary Cook (Financial Swaps), Peter Keohane (Canada), Ed Essandoh (Retail), Paul Darmitzel (Retail) and Elizabeth Sager (Power Trading) (Team Leader).  This group will focus on, among other things, managing Enron's exposures with bankrupt counterparties, working out credit solutions with distressed counterparties and standardizing our overall credit practices.  The initial members in this group have been drawn from Enron's numerous legal groups in order to gain a broader perspective.   Each of these members will provide support to this new group in addition to their current responsibilities.

	Within RAC, Michael Tribolet will focus on distressed counterparties, in conjunction with Bill Bradford, who continues to manage the Credit Risk Management group.    

	Please join us in supporting the efforts of this new group.

"NEW EES FEES","The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.  The new fees are as follows:

	1-100mw's=$3 fee
	100-200mw's=$4 fee
	over 200mw=$5 fee

Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.

thanks,

ryan

"SECURITY TRAVEL UPDATE","As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under ""bulletins"" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov.

Recruiting Roundup

Today (Monday) was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big
recruiting push by going to top recruits' schools and homes, but the big game
Saturday has pushed that back a week.
But don't worry about it. Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and
his previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have
been great.
This year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants
have signed. There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better
than the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class.
They already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have
been on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked
as one of the top five in the nation.
Let's take a look at where they are and where they are going:
OFFENSE
Quarterback
UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot
better than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot
at Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game
Friday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even
running an interception back for a touchdown. (Yes, he plays defense, too,
when needed.)
Running Back
The Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten Smithson Valley and
are in the hunt for power-runner deluxe Albert Hardy of Galena Park and
elusive Selvin Young of Jersey Village. They have an outside shot at Lorenzo
Booker of Ventura, Cal., the nation's highest rated running back.
Tight End
David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship, a national top 100 player on some lists,
is already committed. He is very good. The only other TE the Horns are
recruiting is Eric Winston, the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at
Midland Lee.
Wide Receiver
National top 100 star Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and Dustin Miksch
of Round Rock Westwood are already committed. Robert Timmons of Flower Mound
Marcus, a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because
of transfer problems, is a possibility, and, if the Horns don't get him, they
might wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein
Forest.
Line
The Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen, a great pass
blocker who is on several national top 100 lists, and from Brett Valdez of
Brownwood, a tremendous run blocker.
They are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of
Spring Westfield. Blalock is the best run blocker I've seen this year.
DEFENSE
End
Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, a national top 100 player, has committed
and will enroll in January and go through spring training, which will give
him a chance to see action as a true freshman. The Longhorns are in the hunt
for Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., a speed rusher deluxe, Larry Dibbles of
Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands. All three are on every national
top 100 list I've seen.
Tackle
Texas has commitments from four top tackles - Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast
Community College, a JC in Mississippi, Earl Anderson of San Marcos, Lyle
Sendlein of Scottsdale Chapaparral and Tully Jantzen of Keller. Davis has
some academic issues. Sendlein also is a very good offensive lineman and
Jantzen is swift enough to play end. Texas has a very good shot at Rodrique Wr
ight of Alief Hastings, the nation's top DT, and at Marco Martin of Mesquite,
another national top 100 player. Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo, who
excels at DT and OG, also is a strong possibility. It's 50-50 on whether he
will play offense or defense in college. He is the son of David Studdard, a
former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos.
Linebacker
Texas starts three seniors and needs a great group. Garnet Smith of Arlington
Lamar, Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are
already committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from
Texas and across the country. A. J. Nicholson of Winston Salem, N. C., and
Aaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top 100 middle backers who are
strongly considering Texas, and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus
Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life, are fast outside backers the Horns
are recruiting. Another possibility is Lance Mitchell a top JC linebacker in
California who ir orignally from Dallas. He is considering taking a visit.
Defensive Backs
Matt Melton, a hard-hitting safety from Tyler, is already committed. Swift
Edorian McCullough of North Garland, the Class 5A 100 meter champ, also is
considering Texas, along with Brodney Pool, a big, fast safety from Houston
Westbury.
Kicker
Texas is looking for a kicker, but has not homed in on one yet. The coaches
want someone who can kick off into the end zone consistently.

Longhorn Basketball Adds Pair

Twotop basketball recruits have signed with Texas, head coach Rick Barnes has
announced.
Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound forward from Austin Westlake, and Kenton
Paulino, 6-2, 165, a com bo guard from  Los Angeles Fremond HS who will play
for Maine Central Institute this season, are the new signees.
""Signing Brad and Kenton is another sign that our program is really on the
rise,"" Barnes said.  ""Both have great athleticism and an attitude of winning
about them that we need to continue to bring to The University of Texas.""
Buckman plays for coach Clifton McNeely is at Westlake and is a national top
30 recruit.
The No. 2 high school prospect in  Texas according to Mike Kunstadt's Texas
Hoops, Buckman averaged 19.8 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 blocks per game
during his junior season.
He also is tabbed the No. 15 prospect in the nation by Clark Francis' Hoop
Scoop.  Buckman earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the prestigious
Pitt3 Five-Star Camp this July in Pittsburgh, Pa.
""There's not a program in the nation that did not go after Brad during the
recruiting period, so to come out on top in that battle is a huge win for
us,"" Barnes said.
""Brad turned down four of the most storied programs in college basketball
history for the opportunity to play at Texas."" Barnes said.
""He made one of the biggest jumps in his game that I have seen during the
summer camp period.
Brad has a tremendous competitive fire and is one of those players that fans
here will really appreciate.""
Paulino plays under coach Carl Hendrickson at Maine Central.  He starred at
Fremont High School under coach Sam Sullivan, where he averaged 24 points a
game and earned Los Angeles Co-Player of the Year accolades during his senior
campaign.
""Kenton is one of those explosive scoring guards that we need in our
program,"" Barnes said.
""He is a very good shooter with range and an exceptional athlete who
high-jumped 6-10 in high school. Kenton is the complete guard we were looking
for.""

Horns Sign 2 in Softball

Texas softball coach Connie Clark has signed centerfielder Tina Boutelle of
Katy Taylor and second baseman Chezare Sievers of Aliso Niguel HS in Mission
Viejo, Calif.
""We are excited about signing two of the top recruits in the country,"" Clark
said. ""Tina and Chezare will be immediate impact players for us. We only lose
two players to graduation in the spring of 2002 and are pleased to have Tina
and Chezare as our newest additions to the softball program.""
Boutelle, a 5-5 left-handed hitter, was named first team All-American as a
junior while helping her team to a 31-4 record and a second-place finish at
the Texas 5A State Championship.
She also is an All-District and All-Greater Houston selection. She was named
to the Texas Girls Coaches Association All-State Team and first team Academic
All-District in 2000.
Boutelle helped the Katy Cruisers club team to its second consecutive ASA
Gold National Championship in 2001, playing with UT freshmen pitcher Cat Os
terman and third baseman/shortstop Tiffany Anders. With her addition, the
Longhorns will have five players on the roster that have played for the Katy
Cruisers.
""Tina is definitely a long-ball threat,"" Clark said. ""She has tremendously
quick hands and extremely good foot speed. Tina also is the type of player to
make things happen because she plays with a lot of passion and enthusiasm.""
Sievers  finished her 2001 season with a .427 batting average and 19 RBIs.
She was named first team All-League and second team All-County as a junior.
The 5-0 infielder also was named first team All-California Interscholastic
Federation (CIF) as a sophomore. She is a member of the California Cruisers
club team, which placed second at the 2001 ASA Gold National Championships to
the Katy Cruisers.
""Chez can cover a lot of ground,"" Clark said. ""She is an extra-base type of
hitter who also has the ability to play the short game. Chez also has
tremendously quick hands and I think fans will be excited to watch her play.""

Longhorn Women Start Fast

Sophomore center-forward Stacy Stephens led the Longhorn women's basketball
team to the championship of the Paradise Jam Tournament in St. Thomas last
weekend.
Stephens was named the tourney MVP after leading Texas past Southern
California, 66-64, in the championship game. She had 16 points and six of
them came in the final two minutes.
Freshman Heather Schreiber was named to the All-Tournament Team after scoring
13 points, and another freshman forward, Kala Bowers, had 10 points.

"Presentation Announcement","
You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications.

"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Dear Ms. Roffmann:

I am with Enron Power Marketing Inc. and have been working on our effort to test as an LSE in flight 1001.  I have a couple of questions regarding transmission services and hope that you can answer them or direct me to the person who can.

We need to speak with someone who can assist us in getting a service agreement set up for the Reliant control area in order for us to operate as a Load Serving Entity.  If someone can explain or provide information regarding the basic service package or other available packages that would be extremely helpful. 

Any help you can offer would be greatly appreciated.

Regards,

Smith L. Day

Volume 12, No. 6, November 26, 2001

(Editor's Note - I'm sending this in four pieces today because it is a bigger
issue than usual due to the spring recruiting in basketball, track and
softball.)

Volume 12, No. 6, November 26, 2001

 Benson, Defense Stifle Ags; Huge Upsets Propel
Horns Into Big 12 Title Game Against Colorado

As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted, it was an old-fashioned,
rock-em, sock-em game in College Station before a state record football crowd
of 87,555 Friday, and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late
touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson.
After taking the 21-7 victory, head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team
on its fine 10-1 season and said he wasn't worried about the Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) ""because we'll be in it.""
I don't know if had a crystal ball, but immediately after the Longhorns'
expected victory, top-rated Nebraska was humiliated, 62-36, by Colorado, and
the next day No. 3 Oklahoma, a 27-point favorite lost at home to Oklahoma
State, 16-13. It was only the fifth time OSU has won at OU.
The good news is those games moved Texas up to the No. 3 spot in both major
polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the
first time since that 14-3 loss to OU back in October.
Texas plays Colorado Saturday at 7 p.m. in Irving's Texas Stadium for the Big
12 Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls, possibly
even the Rose Bowl in the national title game.
But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the
Longhorns out of the BCS mix.
Brown and his players are tickled orange, however, at the chance to play for
the conference championship.
""The BCS isn't an issue today,"" Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in
Norman. ""The Bowl game isn't an issue today.""
""We said we needed to get to the championship game,"" he said, ""but once you
get there, you need to win. After that, you just look up and try to figure
out where you are.""
""People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks,"" Brown said.
""Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end (of the season) and the
end's not even near where it should be.""
""People haven't given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five
weeks. To our kids' credit and to Colorado's kids credit, they kept working
hard and now they are in this game.""
The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the
Buffaloes, but we can enjoy it just a little longer.
This was a game where the defenses weren't going to give up a lot, but the
Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers
blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored.
The Aggies tied it on a 27-yard drive after a fine punt return in the third
quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind, which was around 15
miles per hour with frequent gusts to 25 or 30 miles per hour.
But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the
pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that
changed the field position for the rest of the game.
After a short Aggie punt midway through the period, the Longhorns rode
Benson's strong legs to a touchdown, then they got another from the powerful
freshman after Everick Rawls' interception in the final two minutes.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. After each defense got a quick stop, the
Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery
returned it 23 yards for a Longhorn TD and a 7-0 lead with 7:44 left. Another
three-and-out by the Aggies, followed by a shanked punt, gave Texas
possession at the UT 47. The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum
missed a 49-yard field goal try. Defenses dominated the quarter.  A&M led in
first downs, 3-2, and in total yardage, 40-25.
Second Quarter
A shanked punt by UT's Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn 47.
A&M couldn't move, but punted the ball dead at the UT 7. The Longhorn
offense, which had done little with the stiff wind, couldn't move into it,
and Bradford's 30-yard punt, a good one into the wind, gave A&M possessiion
at the UT 39. The Aggies made a first  down at the 26 before stalling. Cody
Scates missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. An interception of a long pass at
the UT 5 by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half
finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense, which drove to
midfield and killed all but 50 seconds of the half before stalling. Texas had
a 7-5 lead in first downs and a 92-60 lead in total offense at intermission.
Third Quarter
Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half. The Horns
couldn't move and punted. A&M's Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt
return, starting right, then racing left and going down the sideline for 37
yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT 27. The Aggies hit a pass
to the UT 8, then 220-pound RB Keith Joseph took over, powering to the left
to the 4, then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with
10:41 left. The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield, sparked
by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife. But, facing fourth down with an
inch or two needed, a lineman flinched and UT drew a 5-yard penalty and had
to punt.
Fourth Quarter
Benson, who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters, got 5 and
then 24 yards on his first two carries of the final period, getting the Horns
to the Aggie 45. But the UT offense stalled again and Bradford's punt was
killed at the Aggie 8. The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and
Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the A&M 40 and returned it
to the 35. Benson got loose for 12 to the 23, then got 5 and 2 to the 16. On
third and 3, Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle  to the A&M 5. Benson
powered through the right side for the TD on the next play. Mangum's kick put
UT on top, 14-7, with 7:22 left. Rawls interception at the A&M 27 and return
to the 12 with 1:59 left set up the final UT touchdown. Benson got 1, then
ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the
final 21-7 count.

Rose Bowl Road Full of Thorns

 If you still have some hope the Longhorns will be playing for the national
title in the Rose Bowl on January 3, here's what it would take:
1. A victory over Colorado Saturday.
2. A loss for either Florida or Miami and probably a loss for Oregon, too,
because the Ducks were ahead of Texas in the last BCS ratings. The Horns have
to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the final BCS ratings on December 9 to get to
Pasadena.
Miami plays at Virginia Tech Saturday, while Florida hosts Tennessee and
Oregon also is at home against Oregon State
If Florida beats Tennessee, the Gators would have to win the SEC title game
on December 8 against the winner of Saturday's game between Auburn and LSU.
Since that game is in Baton Rouge and Auburn's outstanding running back broke
his shoulder two weeks ago, LSU probably will be the Gators' Dec. 8 opponent.
It's asking a lot for two of those three teams to lose a game, but after the
games in Boulder and Norman last weekend, anything is possible.

Longhorn Notes

* Saturday's meeting between Texas and Colorado will be the sixth Big 12
Championship Game. Texas won the inaugural title game in 1996, Nebraska
triumphed in 1997 and 1999, Texas A&M won the title in 1998 and Oklahoma took
the crown in 2000. If Texas wins Saturday, the Longhorns will join Nebraska
as the only two-time champs.
* Since the Big 12 Championship Game counts in statistical manners, RB Cedric
Benson has a great chance to become the first Longhorn freshman to rush for
more than 1,000 yards in a season. He has 974 yards and ranks second among
Longhorn freshmen behind Ricky Williams, who rushed for 990 yards in 1995.
* Benson broke the UT freshman record for touchdowns with his pair of
fourth-quarter rushing scores. He has 12 touchdowns on the season  - 11
rushing and one on a shovel pass reception  -breaking the record of 10 set by
Roy Williams last year.
* Benson had only 12 yards on 14 carries after three quarters Friday in
College Station, but he finished strong, carrying 13 times for 67 yards and
scoring the Longhorns' only two offensive touchdowns in the final period. He
finished with 27 carries for 79 yards and two touchdowns.
* The UT defense is allowing 77.4 yards a game rushing, the fourth lowest
average in school history, trailing only teams from the old one-platoon days
when defense dominated and 7-0 games were the norm. The only lower season
averages were 57.5 in 1942, 65.9 in 1941 and 69.5 in 1943.
* This is Texas' first 10-win season since 1995, which was the last time
Texas won at Kyle Field. The Longhorns have had 15 teams with 10 or more wins
in a season, but this is just the third since 1983.
* Texas evened the series in College Station 21-21-2.UT leads the overall
series, 69-34-5
* The Texas defense has held its last eight opponents to less than 300 yards
of total offense. Texas A&M gained 165 yards, which was the fourth time Texas
has held its opponent to less than 200 yards in 2001.
* Sophomore WR B.J. Johnson extended his streak of consecutive games with a
catch to 23, a UT record to start a career and the third-longest in school
history. Mike Adams holds the school record of 26, which he set from 1995-96.
* Sophomore WR Roy Williams has caught a pass in 20 straight games. He had
eight receptions o move into sixth place on the UT career receptions list
(102). He also moved into second place on UT's single-season list with 62
receptions.
* Junior QB Chris Simms passed for 138 yards, giving him 2,473 yards on the
season and placing him second on the UT single-season chart. Major Applewhite
holds the UT record with 3,357 yards in 1999.
* Senior LB D.D. Lewis tied the UT record with his 49th straight start. He
now shares the record with Dan Neil (1993-96).
* Freshman WR Tony Jeffery scored his second career touchdown when he
returned Rod Babers' blocked punt 23 yards in the first quarter. His first
score came against Houston when he had a 17-yard touchdown reception. Texas
has returned two blocked punts for touchdowns in 2001 - the first was by
sophomore safety Phillip Geiggar against New Mexico State.
* Junior CB Rod Babers blocked a punt for the second straight game. It was
his second blocked kick of the season and the fifth for Texas as a team.
Texas has blocked seven kicks overall this season.
* Friday's victory marked UT's eighth straight road victory and 12th in its
last 14 games.
* Texas has produced seven defensive or special teams scores in 2001,
including four in the last three games.
* The Texas defense has had an interception in six straight games and eight
of 11 games this season.
* Texas is 28-1 when scoring first, 34-5 when leading at halftime and 33-0
when outrushing its opponent during the Mack Brown era. The Horns are 4-12
when they are outrushed during the Brown era.

Texas, the BCS and the Bowl Situation

Forget calculating the Longhorns' BCS standings and their chances of getting
into a BCS bowl.
It all got simplified when Nebraska and Oklahoma both lost last weekend.
Now, two improbable division winners - Texas in the South and Colorado in the
North - will meet Saturday for the Big 12 Championship and the automatic BCS
berth that goes with it.
It would take another big round of upsets for Texas to make it to the
National Championship Game in the Rose Bowl, but a second victory over the
Buffs Saturday would guarantee the Horns a BCS bowl bid.
It could be the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix, which normally gets the Big 12
champion if the Big 12 champ isn't in the national title game.
But the BCS bowls can trade things around, and the Rose Bowl, normally the
meeting place for the Big 10 and Pac 10 champs, won't have a team from either
of those conferences in it unless Oregon gets lucky.
So, some Fiesta Bowl folks would like to turn their bowl into ""Rose Bowl II""
by inviting the Big 10 and Pac 10 champs.
They reportedly have been talking to the Sugar Bowl folks about switching
teams, and the New Orleans folks reportedly would love to have the Longhorns,
assuming they take care of business Saturday in Texas Stadium.
There also is an outside chance the Orange Bowl will get in on the swapping,
so the Horns could wind up there.
And what if Colorado pulls another big upset Saturday? Then we hope all of
you love the Cotton Bowl, because that is where Texas will be when the new
year begins.
The new BCS standings will be issued Monday, but, for the first time since
that all started, it really won't matter where Texas stands because a win
Saturday will guarantee a BCS bowl berth and a loss will guarantee there
won't be a BCS bowl berth for Texas.

"LCRA modification","Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which affected the following deals:

275298	Jan-00			modified option premium
288187		Feb-00			modified option premium
300368	Mar-00			modified option premium
316345		Apr-00			modified option premium

397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips

What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed through to your systems?  Does everything prior to the current month need to be auto-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?

Thanks!

Subject: PBR and Pumpkins
Date:    Wed, 3 Oct 2001 11:21:37 -0700

An afternoon of PBR and Pumpkins... how could life get any better?!

To celebrate the passing of summer into fall (and to get rid of this keg
of beer that just doesn't seem to fit on our boat) Nick and I would like
to announce that this weekend we will be hosting our first annual--

                                                SAUVIE ISLAND HARVEST
BBQ!

Please join us in the festivities at Parker's Marina, this Sunday,
October 7, on Sauvie Island.  Weather-pending, the BBQ will begin at 3
pm, but you are most certainly welcome to head to the island earlier to
stock up on pumpkins, corn stalks, and fresh autumn produce.  The
pumpkin patches on Sauvie are open for business...and most are u-pick,
so make sure to dress accordingly. We'll tap the keg at one (for those
of you who think you'd pick a prettier pumpkin while sauced), and
probably be out picking pumpkins ourselves until 2 pm or so.  

We'll provide the brew, the grillables (including veggie options) and
some salads-- but also feel free to bring your favorite potluck dish.
We'd also suggest bringing lawn chairs (of some variety), as seating
otherwise would be on the grass.  If Nick can get the dinghy up and
running before the weekend- free dinghy rides for the kids (and yes,
phil, you too.)  

Getting to our place is easy.  Sea kayakers can paddle to our place up
the Willamette river, then into the Multnomah Channel. Cyclists, from
downtown Portland to the island, can follow Hwy. 30 for a nice and easy
30 mile ride round-trip.  Drivers, directions are listed below.   

Hope everyone can make it.  Spouses, dogs, kids, roommates and
significant others are all welcome!  Please pass this message along to
friends whose email addresses I don't have, and most certainly feel free
to bring new friends too.  The more, the merrier. 

Keeping my fingers crossed for one more weekend of sun.  Hasta pronto--
amy

Clint and I revised all of the LCRA capacity pymts this afternoon, which affected the following deals:

275298	Jan-00			modified option premium
288187		Feb-00			modified option premium
300368	Mar-00			modified option premium
316345		Apr-00			modified option premium
331019		May-00			modified option premium
347153		Jun-00			modified option premium
425790	Dec-00 through Feb-01 modified annuity strips
397802	Mar-01 through Dec-02 modified annuity strips

What steps need to be taken now to make sure these changes get pushed through to your systems?  Does everything prior to the current month need to be auto-scheduled or is it only annuities (not option premiums)?

Thanks!

Andrea

"ISO Increase in Grid Management Charges","All,
	I attended the Market Issues Forum at the California ISO yesterday and wanted to inform you of an important upcoming change in Grid Management (GMC) rates.  Starting January 1st, 2002, the CAISO anticipates raising GMC charges significantly.  They cited the following reasons for this:  1.  An under collection of GMC for year 2001, this must be past on to the following year according to the tariff.  2.  The lack of credit for the CAISO, increasing interest charges, as well as creating an inability to issue bonds for capital projects.  They must raise 100% of any capital expenditures in the current fiscal year, rather then spreading out the cost over a number of years with a bond issuance.  3.  A decrease in overall market volumes.  GMC is allocated on a flat fee, per megawatt basis, so decreasing volumes results in decreasing collections.  
	The CAISO points out their costs will remain flat from 2001 to 2002.  They anticipate volume levels next year similar to what current volumes are, thus reducing the amount of megawatts they can effectively spread out their GMC charges over.  
	I have the following observations:  1.  Despite the decrease in volumes, and the decrease in overall market activity, the CAISO has no plans to reduce its current workforce of 500+ employees.  2.  When posed the question: Is CERS charged GMC for out of market energy?  Their answer was circumspect at best.   3.  The CAISO currently does not assess GMC charges to ancillary service volumes, they indicated however that they are strongly considering changing this policy to increase the denominator that they can spread out GMC.  
	The CAISO would also like to point out that these increases are worse case scenarios, and may not be this high.  But as we are all aware, in the California energy market, the worst-case scenario ends up looking optimistic in comparison to what actually ends up happening.  Below is a detailing of the changes.  

-Kit

Charge Code	Description	Current Rate	Proposed New Rate	Percentage Increase	
521	Control Area Services Charge	$0.4060 	$0.5140 	27%	
522	Inter-zonal Scheduling Charge	$0.2230 	$0.3080 	38%	
523	Market Operations Charge	$0.9510 	$1.6080 	69%

"Organizational Announcement","
As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO."" This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

"Martel Outage","Group,

Just wanted to give you an update on the Wheelabrator Martel outage.  They are currently only producing 9mw (they are prescheduled at 13mw), and we are selling them 4mw back real-time in order to cover their preschedule.  I just spoke with Mike Burt at the plant, and he said that they will continue producing 9mw through HE4 on Thursday, 9/27.  Beginning HE5, they will be going down to 0mw, so at that point we need to sell them 13mw, through HE16.  At that point in time they should be back to full power and producing 13mw (their full preschedule).

I'll keep you posted on any changes.
Thanks,

From 4:00 - 8:00 p.m., Trizechan Properties has scheduled a shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center.  Enron Network Services will power down the 3AC network infrastructure between 3:30-4:00.  There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

"Valuing ERCOT Industrial Load","I met with the Research team responsible for building a model for EES and ran through the model. The model can be used to value ERCOT deals or at least we can use it as a benchmark for pricing. I have attached a document that summarizes what EES is using the model to price, and how we can use it to price our deals. I am out tomorrow but will be back in the office Wed. morning. Research is looking at historical ERCOT prices and customer load data (TXI). I will set up a meeting on Wednesday to further discuss the model and other issues associated with deal valuation.

Additional information. 

Morrow's energy will be selling firm in the hourly market. 

Also, PNGC (the marketer for Umitilla Electric whose service territory Morrow is located) would like Enron to give their RT group a courtesy call when starting the unit. They can be reached at 503-287-1205.

Stan will be able to answer any questions.

Real Time Traders,

Morrow Power wants to take their unit to the market to get some run time before they begin selling Firm energy. So I'd like the Real Time group to sell the unit at the best price in the hourly market. 

I've already bought gas for Friday and Saturday operations. I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday. 

To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price. 

To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.

Also, I've bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour. 

I'll be out this afternoon and tomorrow and Stan will be standing in for me. I'll be available on my cell phone for any questions.

Les

"TUESDAY 8 a.m. - Houston-based All-Employee Meeting Offered by Videoconference in Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams","Our IT group has made arrangements for us to see Ken Lay's All-Employee Meeting in Houston via videoconference in Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams on Tuesday at 8 a.m.  You should still be able to view it on your computers if you prefer.  

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron@ENRON   On Behalf Of Ken Lay@ENRON
Sent:	Monday, October 22, 2001 4:29 AM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	All-Employee Meeting

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Enron Update","Following our announcement of an additional of $1 billion credit line, Standard & Poor's (S&P) today downgraded Enron's long-term credit rating one notch from BBB+ to BBB and short-term rating from A2 to A3.  We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

We will continue to update you as new developments arise.  Thank you.

"Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats","We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word ""Anthrax.""
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as ""personal"" or ""confidential"".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

"Travel Security Update","
As the United States begins to recover from the tragic events of September 11, it is important that Enron and its employees also begin the task of returning to ""business as usual.""   As a company with a global presence, returning to normal business practices necessarily involves travel.  
 The FAA has already implemented strengthened security measures for U.S. airports and air carriers to ensure air transportation is safe, secure, and ready to meet the needs of the traveling public.  We encourage all employees to return to their regular travel schedules.
We have no reason to believe that international travel is inherently unsafe at this time, although we strongly recommend -- in conjunction with the U.S. Department of State -- that all travel to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.   
Employees planning international travel can find updated security information on their country of destination on http://home.enron.com under the ""International Travel"" section of the Corporate Security website.  
All U.S.-based employees should continue to make their travel arrangements through Travel Agency in the Park at (713) 650-8080 or (800) 962-0248. Other employees should contact their local travel agency for assistance.

"Long 10 mws flat in SP-15--","Group,
We are still short 50 mws in ST-WBOM on peak Friday and Saturday at $27.60.

For Friday only (as of right now) I have picked up 10 mws of energy flat (24hr schedule). I bought this energy from the APX-deal #840719 at $25. We will be long 10 mws each hour in position manager in SP-15 as a result. Please sell this energy in the off-peak (on-peak will go to fill our W-BOM short). I have scheduled an HA 24 purchase from the APX 1 and have put the energy into the ST-WBOM load zone. 

Do call with questions.
Cell: 503-887-3449

"Computer Virus","
There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Thank you.
Enron Global Technology

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Kearney Recruits Terrific Class
Five of the nation's top prep track and field prospects, including four state
champions and one national high school record-holder, have signed with
Longhorn women's track coach Beverly Kearney.
The class is headed by four of the nation's top sprinters - Ychlindria Spears
of Luling, who also is the national record holder in the triple jump; Ashlee
Williams of Dallas Bishop Dunne, who also had the nation's top high hurdles
clocking last season; state Class 4A 100, 200 and triple jump champ LaToya
Phelps of Greenville; Florida sprint-jump star Sanya Richards of Fort
Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, and relay ace Sheretta Jones of Houston Forest
Brook.
""We are really excited about the class we have coming in for the 2003
season,"" Kearney said. ""The quality of this class is phenomenal and this may
be one of the best we've put together since we've been here.""
""Each athlete in this class is an exceptional signee, but together they take
it to a whole other level. They are competitive, mature and focused, and we
are extremely excited about the quality of individuals we are bringing into
the program.""
Kearney's class is headlined by Spears, who was the 2001 Gatorade National
High School Girls' Track and Field Athlete of the Year as a junior.
The nation's top prep female jumper and a proven sprinter, Spears set a
national high school record in the triple jump with a 44-2 1/4 mark at the
2001 Texas 3A State Championships last May.
Besides winning the triple at last spring's state meet, Spears claimed gold
in the long jump and swept the 100- and 200-meter dashes on her way to
scoring all 40 of Luling's third-place points.
Her season-best long jump of 20-9 1/4 also led the nation last year, and she
went on to win the USATF Junior Nationals in the event with a wind-aided 20-9
3/4 effort.
She ended her junior season as the state's top performer in all
classifications in the long and triple jumps, No. 2 in the 200 (23.84) and
No. 5 in the 100 (11.64).
Prior to her junior year, Spears qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials
in the long jump where she finished 14th in her flight. Over the last three
years, Spears has won 11 out of a possible 12 gold medals at the state meet
and won over 40 events on the district, regional, state and national levels.
Spears is also an honor student, ranking in the top five percent of her class.
""Ychlindria is a phenomenal athlete who can add quality depth in the long
jump, triple jump and 100 immediately,"" Kearney said.
""She has all the tools necessary to be successful not only on the collegiate
level, but internationally as well. She is talented and versatile and we
think she is one of the most competitive athletes out there.""
Williams is one of the top prep sprinter-hurdler prospects in the country. A
standout for Dallas Bishop Dunne High on the TAPPS 4A level, she has swept
state titles in the 200, 100 hurdles and 4x100 and 4x200 relay the last two
seasons in leading Bishop Dunne to consecutive team titles
Last March, Williams set a state record in the 100 hurdles with a
personal-best 13.23 clocking at the Texas Southern Invitational in Houston.
Last summer, she struck gold in the 100 hurdles at the USATF Junior Nationals
in Richmond, Va., and at the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, Calif.
She closed her junior season as the nation's top prep performer in the 100
hurdles and No. 15 in the 100 (11.67). Williams also posted the state's third
fastest time in the 200 (23.81) and the No. 7 time in the 100.
""Ashlee is one of the fastest hurdlers to come out in several years,"" Kearney
said. ""She has the potential to develop into a great hurdler and sprinter.
She reminds me a lot of (former Longhorn track and field star) Angie Vaughn,
but she is much faster and more seasoned at this point.""
Richards has been one of the top all-around track and field performers in the
Florida high school ranks for the past three years, making her mark in the
sprints and jumps. She has led St. Thomas Aquinas to three consecutive
Florida 3A State Championships, the most recent coming last spring when she
grabbed gold in the 100, long jump and 4x100 relay and silver in the 400.
At the 2000 state meet, Richards swept the 100, 200, long jump and 4x100
relay to lead her team to a convincing 110-point win. On the national level
last summer, Richards swept the 100 and 200 at the USATF Junior Olympics and
placed fourth in the 400 at the Adidas Outdoor Championships in Raleigh, N.C.
Indoors, she was second in the 200 and third in the 60 at the New York Armory
NSIC last March.
She finished her season ranked No. 6 nationally  in the 200 (23.57) and long
jump (19-11 1/2), No. 7 in the 400 (53.47) and No. 8 in the 100 (11.59).
""Sanya is the youngest member of this class, but she is a soldier,"" Kearney
said. ""She is a team all wrapped up by herself, because she can do so many
different things.""
Phelps , who also a standout basketball player, won the 100 in 11.55, the 200
in 23.8 and the triple jump  with a 42-8 1/4 leapat the 2001 Texas 4A State
Meet.
She won district titles in the 100, 200, 4x200 relay, long jump and triple
jump and regional titles in the 100, 200 and triple jump. Her personal-best
triple jump of 42-8 1/4 ranked No. 2 nationally at the end of her junior
season.
""LaToya may be the sleeper of this class,"" Kearney said. ""She is a phenomenal
athlete and an excellent basketball player. She won three state titles last
year as a junior, and she is one of the top triple jumpers in the country.""
Jones has been one of the state's top quarter-milers as a member of perennial
power Houston Forest Brook's track and field teams the past two years. She
won district and regional titles in the 400, with a best time of 55.5, on her
way to finishing fourth in the quarter at the Texas 4A State Championships
last May.
She also helped the school's 4x400 relay squad to the district title and
runner-up finishes at the regional and state meets. As a sophomore, she
finished third in the 400 and 4x400 relay at the state meet.
""Sheretta has done an outstanding job for Forest Brook on the relays and in
the sprints,"" Kearney said. ""I look at her open performances and I think
she'll be able to contribute right away. She reminds me of (current Longhorn)
Raasin McIntosh, and we think she can end up being as good as anyone.""

UT Men Sign Great Track Class
Five top high school recruits, headed by Austin Reagan High sprinter Brendan
Christian, plus one All-American transfer from Arkansas, have signed with
Longhorn men's trackcoach Bubba Thornton. The NCAA track and field signing
period started last Wednesday and extends through this Wednesday.
In addition to Christian, the Longhorn track signees include twin brothers
Aaron and Ashton Collins of New Orleans Clark, Nicholas Johnson of Fort Worth
Wyatt, Joe Thorne of Atlanta Lakeview)and the Arkansas transfer - Jason Ward
of Tilgham HS in Paducah, Ky.
Christian is one of the nation's top sprinters in the 100 and 200, where he
holds the state Class 4A record with a 20.56 clocking at the State Meet last
May, and he also has run a 45.5 leg on Reagan's 1,600-meter relay team.
Johnson, the younger brother of Longhorn senior sprinter Amar Johnson, is
another top sprinter with a 10.33 100 meters clocking. The Collins brothers
are outstanding in the longer sprints, Thorne is one of nation's top
performers in the distance races and the steeplechase, and Ward is already
established as one of the top triple jumpers at the collegiate level.
""In our minds, this is one of the top classes in the nation,"" Thornton said.
""Each athlete has an immediate chance to contribute to our program next year.
They can have a national impact for us right away, not just in their
performances but as leaders as well.""
""Each individual has great qualities, and we're excited about this class as a
whole,"" he said. ""They all are aware of the national scene and are looking
forward to competing against NCAA-caliber athletes.""
Christian, one of the top three or four sprinters in the country, is the
defending Texas Class 4A state champion and record holder in the 200-meter
dash, as well as anchoring  Reagan's regional champion 4x100 and 4x400 relay
teams.
Christian also won 100-meter title last summer at the Adidas Outdoor Track &
Field Championships in Raleigh, N.C., and Golden West Invitational in
Sacramento, Calif. He set the national high school indoor record in the 200
(21.02) at the New York Armory NSIC in March. He  also won the 60 at that
meet and swept the 55 and 200 at the Arkansas National High School
Invitational in January. Christian enters his senior season ranked No. 2
nationally in the 200 (20.56) and No. 4 in the 100 (10.40).
Johnson is a Texas 4A district and regional 100-meter champion for perennial
track power Fort Worth Wyatt. In addition to finishing fourth at last year's
state track meet in the 100, Johnson also ran legs on the Chaparrals'
district champion and state runner-up 4x100-meter relay squad which ended the
season with the second-fastest time in the country (40.39). He ranks in the
national top 10 in the 100 (10.33w) as he enters the 2002  season.
The Collins twins have been stars on the Louisiana track and field scene for
the last three years for New Orleans Clark High. Ashton was a five-time 4A
state champion last year, winning titles in the 400 (indoor and outdoor),
800, 4x200 and 4x400 relay.
He also placed fourth in the quarter at the Golden West Invitational last
summer, and is the No. 2-ranked returning quarter-miler in the nation
(46.29). Aaron won three state crowns last year in the 200, 4x200 and 4x400
relay.
Thorne won the Georgia 5A individual cross country title in leading his
Lakeside High team to a fourth-place finish at the state meet on Nov. 3. He
also posted the second-fastest 5k time in the country this season with a time
of 14:41 at the Alexander Invitational on Oct. 6.
Thorne is the defending state champion in the 1,600 and 3,200, posting the
state's top times in both events last season. Against some of the top runners
in the country, he finished fourth in his first-ever 2,000-meter steeplechase
at the 2001 Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships.
He also placed 12th at the 2000 Foot Locker National Cross Country
Championship in Raleigh, and is one of the favorites to challenge for the
South Regional and National crowns this year.
Ward, the sophomore transfer from Arkansas, was an All-American and All-SEC
performer in the triple jump as a freshman. He skipped to a personal-best
mark of 54-6 to become the national runner-up at the 2000 NCAA Indoor
Championships in Fayetteville, Ark.
He also finished fourth at the SEC Championships with a 52-2 3/4 effort. At
Paducah Tilgham High, Ward was a five-time All-American in track and field.
He also won the triple jump at the USATF Junior Nationals in 1999.

Importance:	High

			Open Enrollment for your 2002 Health Benefits begins Monday, October 29, 2001!  

Q. 	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A. 	If you plan to make changes to your existing benefit coverage, you will need to make changes during Open Enrollment which begins 	Monday, October 29, 2001 at 8:00 AM (Central) and ends on November 12, 2001 at 5:00 PM (Central)
	
	To facilitate these changes, you received an Open Enrollment Benefit Packet at your home address.  This packet contains a personalized 	worksheet and the Enron Instruction Guide to help you make your selections.  
	(If you have not received your Info Packet, please let us know ASAP! ) 


Q.	WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
	1.  If you are satisfied with your current elections and do not need to make changes, do nothing.  Your current choices will automatically roll 	over to 2002. 

	2.  If you plan to make changes to your coverage, you will need to either access the Intranet website at work:  benefits.enron.com    
	or at home at  www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com   or call the Phone Enrollment Line at (800) 332-7979, Option 5.


Q. 	I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.  I NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
A.	If you have more questions or need more information, you may attend our Open Enrollment ""Brown Bag"" Info Session being held on Friday, 	October 26 @ 11:30 PM in the Mt Hood Conference Room.  

See you then!

"UPDATE - Reporting to Work Next Week","
Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

"Organization Changes","Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

"Outlook Web Access for Portland & Calgary","Attention: Portland & Calgary-based Outlook Users
The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday October 15th, Portland & Calgary-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web. This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network. Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook. 
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password. For example:
Username: jdoe4
Password: ********
Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox. Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders. At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.  Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all. Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC. We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for some remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon. At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston, Portland or Calgary mail server.

If you have any questions, please contact your local IT support.

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string
of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln.
Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but
Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12
South at 4-1.
The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The
Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent
years.

Buckman Picks Horns

Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was
recruited by most of the nation's top programs, picked Texas Tuesday, saying
he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in
basketball.
He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end, but also had considered
Kentucky, UCLA, Missouri and others.
He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC, where basketball reigns
supreme, was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina.
But he told me Tuesday, ""I've always wanted to go to Texas. This is where my
heart is.""
He also said his head turned Texas' way at the end because coach Rick Barnes
has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning
big-time recruits
""After looking at it closely,"" he said, ""I think Texas basketball is really
on the upswing. They've signed two McDonald's All Americans (freshman point
guard T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville) in the last two years.""
They could make it three in three years because Buckman's stock soared this
summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments.
Brick Oettinger, publisher of Prep Stars Recruiter's Handbook, was asked who
was the biggest surprise of the summer.
Oettinger said, ""In terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody's top 100
to everybody's top 25 - it would be Brad Buckman. Big forward, very
aggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . .
anybody in the class. I've got him No. 21 now and he wasn't in my top 100.
Dave Telep, another national recruiting analyst, agreed Buckman is a national
top 25 recruit.
""The reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names, there
probably aren't 25 better players in the class,"" Telep said. ""He is athletic,
can handle it some, he blocks shots, he shoots to medium-range and he scores
in the post.""
Clifton McNeely, the Westlake coach, also says his star's work ethic is off
the chart.
""He's a very gifted player with a lot of talent,"" McNeely said, ""but the best
thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic. I don't think you could
find anyone who works harder than he does."" McNeely also said he thinks
Buckman ""is the best player in Texas.""
There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally,
including Bracy Wright of The Colony, who chose Indiana, Daniel Horton of
Cedar Hill, who picked Michigan, and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln, who
committed to SMU.
The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards, but lost out on them
at the end.
Buckman averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for Westlake as a
junior. And he's the kind of blue-collar inside player Barnes loves.
McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-point
range.
Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm, two other Westlake
players he coached who played at UT, he said, ""He has the physical presence
of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school, and he has the range
of Luke.""
He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next
month.
Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players, most of them
in other states, and hope to sign a  sharp shooting guard and a wing.
Buckman's  father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams at
UT.

Basketball Team Has New Look

The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the
addition of heralded point guard T. J. Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
back-to-back Class 5A state titles.
When the season starts next month, Ford will be called upon to speed up the
Horns' offense and also create more opportunities for the team's inside
players with his lightning-quick passes.
Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Ford's creativity in the half-court offense will
improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas, who averaged 7 points and
6.5 rebounds a game last year.
Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior
forward Chris Owens, sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey, and 6-9
forward Brian Boddicker.
Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year. Fredie Williams,
Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point.
Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably, going 25-9 overall and 12-4 in
the tough Big 12, but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88
more turnovers than assists. Ford should help raise the former and lower the
latter.
They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple, and
Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the
playoffs this season.
Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley, who combined for 30.8 of
UT's 70.5 per-game scoring average, creates scoring opportunities for other
shooters. Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity.
He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there. Sydmill Harris, a 6-6 freshman
from The Netherlands, has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts.
Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is
expected to be one of the top players in the Big 12, and a more dependable
scoring threat.
""Ever since last year, the Temple game, it started coming together,"" Owens
said. ""It clicked. I didn't do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the
ability. Now I have the mental concentration.""

UT Women Looking Sharp

Coach Jody Conradt's Longhorn women's basketball team is picked to finish in
the middle of the Big 12 pack, but early practices and stiff competition at
several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that.
The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing
center-forward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries.
Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again, but equally important is
the fact that the Horns' heralded recruiting class is living up to its  hype.
Stacy Stephens, a 6-1 sophomore, returns as the starting center, and 6-2
senior Tracy Cook and the 6-1 Hastings can back her up and also play power
forward.
Jody Bell, a 6-2 freshman from Canada, and 6-1 freshman Mercedes Williams
also are looking good at power forward.
Two freshmen - 6-3 Heather Schreiber, the high school player of the year in
Texas last year, and 6-2 Kala Bowers, last year's high school player of the
year in Oklahoma - are battling for the small forward job (it shows you are
on the right track when you can call 6-3 and 6-2 women small forwards).
Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three
inside positions.
Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot
of action include sophomore Kaira White, who has been looking great in
practice, plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed.
Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation.
RECRUITING NOTES: LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, picked Texas
Tech over Texas last week. Nichelle Roberts, a 6-1 center-forward who teamED
with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs
last year, is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns
have a great chance to sign her.

No. 10 Horns Win Soccer Title

The No. 10 Texas women's soccer team clinched its first Big 12 Conference
title Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Oklahoma.
The Longhorns are 11-3 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12 and have one regular
season match remaining against Texas A&M.
Coach Chris Petrucelli, in his third year at the helm, said, ""This is a huge
step for us. It's going to help us in recruiting. It's going to help us in
marketing. And it's going to help our confidence.""
Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas' third goal Sunday, giving her 11
for the season and tying her with Carol Finch for the season record. Finch
set the record in 1996.
Lerrin Biggers scored Texas' first goal and Kylee Wosnuk got the second one.

"Grays Harbor/Morrow Power","RT Traders,

As of Oct. 1, 2001 Grays Harbor Paper is no longer available for merchant sales as they are now under a long term contract with Grays Harbor PUD.

Over the weekend 9/28 - 9/30 Morrow Power may call to have the RT group sell hourly between 22 - 25 Mw's. This is a new Gas fired unit located in Boardman. I've put a sheet in the Services book showing the account numbers for transmission. Morrow needs to sell at the best price but their costs are between $21 - $23.00.

Morrow Power is a valid conterparty in Enpower.

Feel free to call me if there are any questions.

"Martel Outage","Group,

Wheelabrator Martel (MARTEL_2_AMFOR), NP15, suffered an outage around 0630 PST Monday morning, 10/29.  They are expected to be down for the balance-of-Monday and for most of Tuesday.  They are prescheduled at 10mw for both days.  So please purchase 10mw for them for the remainder of Monday, and for most of Tuesday.  I will talk to whoever is on the Tuesday day shift regarding how long they need power for on Tuesday.

"RE:","Hey there!  Nice to hear from you!  Yeah, we went out the second night,
but it was a little slower (thank goodness).  I think a lot of people
had early flights out the next morning.

This is my last of four nights and I am ready for a break!  Or at least
some sleep.

What was the name of that band you were playing in your car?  I doubt I
can find it up here, but it's worth a try.

Have a great weekend!

	Jennifer,
	I enjoyed meeting you last week.  Too bad we didn't get to meet
up the
	second night.  I definitely had a good time.  Did you go out
again on
	Wednesday?  I tried to call you at your hotel, but I guess I
missed you.
	Talk to you soon.

	Clint

Julie,

As I am getting off night shift today, I will be unable to attend the HR presentation.  I believe I filled out all of the necessary paperwork (W-4, direct deposit, and employment application) to get started and I dropped the beneficiary and benefits paperwork on your desk this morning.  Please write me if there is anything else that you need from me.

Craig Dean

"Important - Please Read","As I'm sure you're all aware, it took the group a day or two to hit its stride after EOL was launched on Aug. 20. We have already received approximately 30 disputes filed by various counterparties regarding deals that flowed on the 20th and 21st. Many of these will be especially difficult to settle correctly given the fact there is virtually no documentation or information to be found regarding the original deal. Some deals done on EOL were altered; other bilateral trades were simply zeroed out; and still others exist only in the Inc sheets. 

This situation outlines the extreme importance of documenting changes in deals as they're being made. If you have reason to zero out a trade done by an earlier shift, or to alter a trade executed online, please convey that reason. Some suggestions:

1. If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift. Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.

2. Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.

3. Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.

If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative. Thanks for your help.

"RE: Good News! Enron Has Reached a Definitive Agreement with Dynergy","Here is the Q&A on the agreement and the press release.

 
Merger Q&A
Nov. 9, 2001 
THE DEAL
What are the deal terms?
The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange. 
The exchange ratio will be 0.2685. As an example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 269 shares of the combined company upon closing. 
Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares. 
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately, and an additional $1 billion upon closing of the merger. 
Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock. 
Enron will have immediate access to the $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.
What approvals are required?
This merger will require SEC and FERC approvals, the approval of shareholders of both Enron and Dynegy, and expiration or termination of the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period. In addition, various approvals are required due to the ownership of Enron's and Dynegy's wholly owned subsidiaries.
From a business standpoint, are Enron and Dynegy now one company?
Not until closing, which may not occur for a number of months. Until that time we will continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have done in the past. In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc. We will act towards Dynegy the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.
When do you expect the deal to close?
The transaction is expected to close by the end of Q3 2002.
Why do you believe this is the best deal for shareholders?
The Board considered numerous options-stand-alone execution, private equity infusions, strategic partner infusion and a merger with a strategic partner. The Enron Board felt that the merger with Dynegy, coupled with the $1.5 billion equity investment, was the best opportunity for continued growth and shareholder value.
What is the ownership structure of the new company? 
On a converted basis, Enron shareholders will own approximately 36% of the new company, and Dynegy shareholders will own 64%. Post closing, the combined company is expected to have approximately 700 million shares outstanding.
What percentage of shareholder votes is required to approve the transaction? 
A majority of Enron shareholders must approve the transaction, and 2/3 of Dynegy shareholders must approve.
Has a new management team been identified?
Chuck Watson - Chairman and CEO
Steve Bergstrom - President and COO
Greg Whalley - Executive Vice President
Robert Doty - CFO
Watson, Bergstrom and Whalley will make up the combined company's Office of the Chairman.
Has Dynegy completed due diligence? Are they satisfied that the potential exposure is manageable?
Dynegy has completed significant due diligence and there is no due diligence out as such. Dynegy was fully aware of the matters reported recently with respect to certain financial statement restatements and related party transactions.
How will the Board seats be allocated?
When the merger is complete, the Board of Directors of the combined company will be comprised of no more than 15 members. Dynegy's designees will include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the right to designate a minimum of three board members.
How will the merger impact customers?
We expect customers to benefit significantly from this combination. This combination provides a wider and more diverse platform to meet the energy needs of our customers with reliable delivery and predictable pricing. Customers will also benefit from broader supply-sources of the two companies.
Does this mean Northern Natural Gas is no longer a part of Enron?
No. Northern Natural Gas will remain an important member of the Enron family. If the merger is terminated Dynegy has a right to acquire Northern Natural Gas, subject to a repurchase right of Enron.
Is Dynegy buying Northern Natural Gas?
No, Dynegy is buying a $1.5 billion preferred stock interest in Northern Natural Gas and acquiring an option to acquire 100% of Northern Natural Gas in certain circumstances if the merger is terminated.
What percent of Northern Natural Gas will Dynegy own?
They will own preferred stock unless and until the merger is terminated and Dynegy exercises its right under certain circumstances to purchase 100% of Northern Natural Gas.
FINANCIAL ISSUES
Why is Enron merging at this price?
Enron's Board of Directors and management considered numerous options to best serve the interest of our shareholders, including: 
Stand-alone execution. 
Private equity infusion. 
Strategic partner infusion. 
A merger with a strategic partner.
The Board and management feel strongly that a merger with Dynegy, which included an immediate infusion of $1.5 billion in cash, offered the best opportunity for continued growth and enhanced shareholder value. 
Have you discussed the combination with the rating agencies?
Yes. The preliminary assessment by the rating agencies has been positive.
ENRON QUESTIONS
What are the immediate business benefits of the transaction?
This deal confirms the value of Enron's core business and strengthens the company's liquidity. This transaction enables the shareholders of both companies to participate in the upside of the combined enterprise.
What will happen to Enron Online?
It will continue as EnronOnline until the transaction closes.
How will you treat proprietary trading information prior to the deal close? What impact will this have on counterparty trading?
Until the deal closes they remain separate companies and will keep confidential trading information confidential.
What will happen to Enron's pending asset sales?
The asset sales we have previously announced are scheduled to move forward.
What happens to the SEC investigation?
As we have from the beginning, Enron will continue to fully cooperate with the SEC investigation.
What happens to the lines of credit Enron took out last week?
Enron drew down on $3 billion from existing credit lines and has obtained commitment letters on an additional $1 billion secured financing.
Will any Enron executives have a role in the combined company's senior management team?
Yes, Greg Whalley will serve as Executive Vice President and will join Dynegy's Office of the Chairman when the transaction closes.
What happens to Ken Lay?
Ken Lay will remain as Chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes. He will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.
Will Enron complete its new building?
Yes.
Is Enron's vision still to be the world's leading company?
Enron's vision will be revisited once the companies are merged.
Will this affect Enron's innovation?
A key strength of Enron and Dynegy has been their employees' innovation and we expect this to continue.
What will this do to our deregulation efforts?
Both Enron and Dynegy share the belief in open markets and competition. We believe our deregulation efforts will continue.
DYNEGY ISSUES
Dynegy profile:
Dynegy Inc. is a leading energy merchant and power generator in North America, the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. A Fortune 100 company, Dynegy in 2000 established its communications business, Dynegy Global Communications, which is engaged in providing network solutions and connectivity to wholesale customers worldwide..
What is ChevronTexaco's relationship to this deal?
ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock. ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion at the closing of the merger.
COMBINED
What will the new company's name be?
The combined company will retain Dynegy's name.
Who will be the CEO of the new company?
Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO of Dynegy Inc. will become the Chairman and CEO of the new entity.
Who will be president?
Steve Bergstrom, president and COO of Dynegy Inc. will become the President and COO of the new entity.
Will there be an integration team? Who will be on it?
The integration process will be focused on designing a strong and efficient organization. Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient transition. Details of the make-up of the team have not yet been determined.
Will the companies merge offices and where?
There are currently no plans to merge offices. Considering the size of a combined organization, however, office spaces will be evaluated at a later date.
COMMUNITY ISSUES
Will Enron Field be renamed?
The combined company will determine this.
Is Enron's contribution program continuing during this time?
The contributions program will still be a focus for Enron, but we have curtailed new giving for now.
What does this merger mean for Houston?
We believe that it is positive for Houston because two premier energy companies will join forces and remain in the city.
EMPLOYMENT ISSUES
Will Enron (or Dynegy) employees be laid off as a result of the merger?
The merger will be a long and complex process. Some elimination of positions is almost inevitable in this type of merger, and one of the key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure and resourcing of the merged company.
How many lay offs will there be?
Prior to the merger, we hope to address any need for employment reductions through attrition and reduced hirings. We cannot rule out involuntary separations, but we have not targeted a specific number at this time.
If I am laid off, either prior to the merger completion (or as a result of it), what will my severance package be? Will the severance plan change?
If an Enron employee is let go prior to the merger, and is eligible for benefits under the Enron Corp. Severance Plan, then the terms of that plan will govern. Post merger, employees will be eligible for benefits under whatever severance plan the merged company adopts. No changes to the severance plan have been made at this time.
What happens to our bonuses this year?
The 2001 bonus process will continue as usual and will be consistent with previous practice based on company and individual performance.
What will happen to my stock options?
Your vested unexercised and unvested options will be converted as follows:
The number of options will be converted on the same ratio as outstanding shares are converted. Your number of Enron options will be multiplied by 0.2685 to calculate the number of Dynegy options at close. At the closing of the merger, the strike price on your Enron options will be divided by the merger ratio 0.2685 to determine the strike price of the new Dynegy options.
Will there be salary adjustments as a result of the merger?
Both companies will continue our market-based approach to compensating employees. In addition, both companies have a strong pay for performance philosophy in regard to total cash compensation. Prior to the merger, there will be no changes in Enron's salary structure. Post merger, we will jointly determine our salary strategy and structure.
What will happen with benefits and retirement programs?
There are no anticipated changes to Enron benefit plans before the merger is completed. Upon completion of the merger we anticipate that there will likely be changes to ensure that one benefits strategy exists for the merged company.
Will the analyst and associate program at Enron continue?
As we bring both companies together, we will look into the possibility of combining both Dynegy's PACE program with Enron's Associate/Analyst program.
Where do I go if I have a question?
A detailed general Q & A on the merger is being prepared at present and will be posted on the Enron Update intranet page. Additionally, Enron and Dynegy HR teams are jointly preparing a detailed employee Q & A to address HR-related questions. This will be posted on the same website as the general Q & A. In the interim, if you have a specific question or concern you may email questions@enron.com. 
INTERNAL ISSUES
What will happen to non-Houston locations?
Decisions will be made about all locations in the coming weeks.
Will moves to the new building continue as planned?
Yes, at this time.
When will we begin seeing changes in our workplace?
Until the merger is completed it is unlikely you will see many changes in the workplace. As things change, we will share this information with you.
Will there be a year-end PRC?
We are still reviewing the year-end process.
Does Dynegy have a performance review process like Enron?
Dynegy has a similar performance review to Enron's.
Will there still be a Chairman's Award?
Yes.
Will any early retirement packages be offered?
There are no plans to offer such packages at this time.
Is there a hiring freeze? Will all open positions at Enron just remain open or be cancelled?
We are carefully evaluating every open position and only staffing those that are critical to the business.
INTERNAL - COMMUNITY RELATIONS
Will the VIP program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
Will the matching gifts program continue?
We are currently evaluating this program.
What happens to the Enron childcare center?
It will continue its current operations. We will re-evaluate operations after the merger.
What happens to ClickatHome?
We are currently evaluating this program.
If employees are laid off, will they be required to pay for their computers from the ClickatHome program?
Enron's current policy will remain in effect which states that individuals who leave as a consequence of involuntary termination are not required to pay back the cost of the computer, however, they are required to pay the taxes as stated on heir W2 form.
Will the Enron Body Shop remain open?
The Body Shop will remain open and continue with normal hours. Once the merger is nearing completion the program will be evaluated.
What does this mean for the United Way?
Both Enron and Dynegy are supporters of the United Way. The merged entity will also continue to support the UW. The company will match all employee contributions to the United Way as promised.

"Harbor Supplementals","Group,

I was informed this afternoon, around 1530 PDT, by Mike at the ISO, that Harbor's wavier rights were taken away due to higher than normal loads expected for tomorrow, Tuesday 10/2.  So, we need to put in supplemental energy bids in for both Harbor units, HARBGN_7_UNITS (80mw) and HARBGN_7_PL2X3 (17.9mw).  Please submit bids as soon as possible, at least by HE20 Monday, 10/1, going through HE24 on Tuesday, 10/2, for both units, at the real-time price cap, of $91.  If the ISO hits the bid, go ahead and accept the bid, and then call the control room to tell them to ramp up.

Thanks a bunch,

"FW: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION","Group,
Here is some input from Tony at EPE regarding running their system. I think the EPE system was run very well on October 18th, but aside from that, this email shows how closely they are watching our performance and what they expect. Let's do our best to continue to provide them with good service.

Thanks,
Bill

Subject: DISPLACING GAS-FIRED GENERATION


 Bill,  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it.  It is always helpful to talk
face to face and have some frank discussion regarding   our current
business relationship.  Hopefully, we'll be able to reciprocate with a
visit in the near future.

On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data and
have come across some instances where I believe we have room to displace
gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power.  In order to do
this, we need to tighten up our real-time operations.  By this, I mean to
start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and
replacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morning
hours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some
base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our
loss will be less).

For example,  Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchases
of around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment for
amounts and times).  We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame.
So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchase
power  was available for $19/mwh.  Furthermore, there was a sale for HE
06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh.  When we enter this sale into our costing
model, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE Power
Marketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) to
cost this sale.

Please look into this matter and  call me if you have any questions or wish
to discuss it further.

"What Does the Dynegy Merger Mean for West Power?","Chris Calger and I will be holding a series of meetings with employees today and tomorrow to communicate what we know about how the merger with Dynegy will impact the West power operations in Portland and San Francisco.

Chris will meet with his team this morning at 9 AM in the Mt. Hood conference room.  All employees who report in to Chris' organization should attend this meeting.  In addition, Structuring, Renewables, Human Resources, and the 4th Floor Legal team should plan to attend Chris' meeting.

Tim will meet with his team this morning at 10 AM in the Mt. Hood conference room.  All employees who report in to my organization should attend this meeting.  In addition, Risk, Credit, IT, Government Affairs, and the 3rd Floor Legal team should plan to attend Tim's meeting.

If you are unsure which meeting to attend please ask.

We realize that many people are out today due to the Veteran's Day holiday (no cash trading or scheduling today).  We will have another meeting tomorrow morning for people who were unable to make it to meetings this morning.  We will announce the time and place of that meeting soon.

We recognize that the last couple of weeks have been unsettling for many people.  Our goal over the next couple of days is to get back to business as usual.  There are no mandatory layoffs planned for this office.  Chris and I met with John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen, and Greg Whalley over the weekend.  Their marching orders were clear -- go back to Portland and get back to work!  As we mentioned in the all-employee meeting a few weeks ago, this office has a reasonable cost structure and is very profitable.

"EPE Cuts - 10/12","Did anyone take care of Powerex cuts on Friday? 

I've entered a sale to Powerex to bookout for two hours in which they cut a preschedule (deal 795777/tag 16EV) and were unable to resupply the entire 25 mw. Sale is for HE 13 - 13 mw @ $46, and HE 21 - 6 mw @ $31. Prices are EPE's incremental costs for those hours, used per Steve at El Paso.

If any of you have more information about these cuts and how they should have been handled, please let me know.

FYI - Cuts were not handled correctly if Real Time Position Manager is not flat when you leave.

"Emergency Power Generator Testing","Group,

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8. This should give us some extra time if something goes wrong when they switch to the back-up power.

Bill

Lawmakers examine relationship between state's grid and traders
By JENNIFER COLEMAN

11/13/2001 
Associated Press Newswires 
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - California grid officials said Tuesday they will stop providing state power buyers with aggregate price information that's not available to other participants in the state's energy market . 
Following a five-hour hearing of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market , officials with the California Independent System Operator said they would cut off that information as of midnight. 
The committee was examining the trading practices of the state power grid, which generators complained gave preferential treatment to the state's energy buyers with the California Department of Water Resources. 
Generators said the ISO, a state-created independent agency that was intended to ensure the smooth operation of the deregulated market , abandoned its independence when it agreed to give DWR additional market information. 
DWR has been buying power for three utilities since January when high wholesale prices brought the companies to the brink of bankruptcy. The ISO can only buy power to balance the grid if a ""creditworthy"" buyer backs the purchase. DWR stepped in to back those purchases. 
ISO officials said they gave DWR traders some information not otherwise available, but DWR requirements forced them to do it. 
In order to buy the cheapest energy for consumers, DWR required that ISO let it know how much energy will be needed in the next hour and approximate prices, so it could shop outside the grid for the best price, said Pete Garris, acting deputy director of DWR's trading arm. 
But that violated the ISO's tariffs and the Federal Power Act that require grid managers to treat all parties equally, said Robert Hayes of Mirant Inc. 
Though FERC has jurisdiction over the generators' complaint, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said he called the committee hearing on the same subject ""to get a full understanding of what exactly has occurred."" 
It's not the generator's only beef with the state's energy traders. 
Hayes said the ISO has also been bypassing bids for available power in order to buy out-of- market energy at higher prices. 
""There is substantial evidence that, at times, the ISO and DWR bypassed lower-cost power available in the real-time market in favor of higher, out-of- market power ,"" Hayes said. 
A majority of those out-of- market purchases were from the Canadian firm Power -Ex, which is the marketing arm of British Columbia Hydro, said Larry Drivon, an attorney for the committee. 
Last week, FERC intervened in another battle between generators and the state, ordering California to pay power suppliers $1.2 billion for energy sales to California since January. 
FERC said it would lift a key component of the commission's effort to stabilize California 's power market if the state does not quickly settle its bill with power generators. 
At issue is the ""must-offer"" requirement that prohibits generators from withholding power from the wholesale electricity market in a bid to drive up prices. FERC imposed it in April after months of soaring power prices and rolling blackouts in California 's deregulated electricity market . 
FERC said generators no longer will be required to do business with the ISO manager of much of the state's electric grid, if ISO does not arrange for prompt payment of past power sales. 
""The must-offer requirement assumes a matching must-pay requirement,"" commissioners said in their order. 
ISO has said it will comply with the order, under which the agency has 15 days to bill the DWR. 
California and federal energy officials said the ""must-offer"" requirement has played a big role in calming the state's previously unsettled energy market . 
""I give the must-offer requirement a lot of the credit for the current lower prices,"" FERC commissioner William Massey said in his dissent from parts of last week's order. 
But Massey agreed with the three other commissioners that something must be done to compel payment or risk a return to a ""dysfunctional"" market in California . 
ISO spokesman Greg Fishman said up to 13,000 megawatts of power a day have been out of service for maintenance in recent weeks, without any blackouts. Last spring, before FERC required generators to sell all their available power , similar outages resulted in blackouts, he said. 
""Today, because of the must-offer requirement, we've been able to meet the demand,"" Fishman said.

Subject:	Anthrax and other Biological Agent Threats

We understand that the recent cases of Anthrax contamination and the possibility that biological agents such as Anthrax may be used in a terrorist attack are raising great concerns among Enron employees.  Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.  Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.  We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.

The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.  To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.  Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.  Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.

Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:

What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?  (Remember, these are only guidelines.  Use your best judgment when determining if a letter or package is suspicious.)

--  It is marked with the word ""Anthrax.""
--  It has a non-identifiable powdery substance on the outside.
--  It is unexpected or from someone unfamiliar to you.
--  Is addressed to someone no longer with your organization or is otherwise outdated.
--  Has no return address, or has one that cannot be verified as legitimate.
--  Is of unusual weight, given its size, or is lopsided or oddly shaped.
--  Has an unusual amount of tape on it.
--  Is marked with restrictive endorsements such as ""personal"" or ""confidential"".
--  Has a strange odor or stain.
--  Shows a city or country in the postmark that does not match the return address.

What do I do if I receive such a letter or package that I believe contains Anthrax?
--  Do not shake or empty the contents of any suspicious envelope or package.
--  Place the envelope or package in a plastic bag or some other type of container to prevent leakage of contents.
--  If you do not have any container, then cover the envelope or package with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover.
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away). 
-- Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.
--  Notify your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities.
--  List all people who were in the room or area when this suspicious letter or package was recognized. Give this list to both the local public health authorities and law enforcement officials for follow-up investigations and advice.  
If you open an envelope or package and a suspicious powder spills out:
--  Do not try to clean up the powder.  Cover the spilled contents immediately with anything (e.g., clothing, paper, trash can, etc.) and do not remove this cover! 
--  Leave the room and close the door, or section off the area to prevent others from entering (i.e., keep others away).
--  Wash your hands with soap and water to prevent spreading any powder to your face.  Report the incident to your local building security official or an available supervisor.  Have them call 911 to alert the local police authorities. 
--  Remove heavily contaminated clothing as soon as possible and place in a plastic bag, or some other container that can be sealed.  This clothing bag should be given to the emergency responders for proper handling. 
--  Shower with soap and water as soon as possible.  Do not use bleach or other disinfectant on your skin. 
--  If possible, list all people who were in the room or area, especially those who had actual contact with the powder. Give this list to both the local public health authorities so that proper instructions can be given for medical follow-up, and to law enforcement officials for further investigation.

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Daily Update","
Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days.

New Board Member & Committee Elected

Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board.  Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts.  He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973.

Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.

SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation

We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest.

With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information.  We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation.

We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events.  Please check back frequently for information and new developments.

I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

"Layoffs","Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

We now have access to a program that should help us to use Deal Blotter as a viable tool for online trading. As you know, no more than one trader may access a given blotter at one time (""Trader ID locked"" error message). Instead, DEAL TICKER can be used by those members of the group not currently trading online, as it allows all users read-only access to STWHOURLY deals done on EOL. It also features a handy ""refresh"" function which will allow you to see Real Time deals in a real time fashion. Here's how to use Deal Ticker:

1. Open DEAL TICKER from the Enpower Launch Pad
2. Click the big plus sign
3. Under desk, specify ""EPMI Short Term West Hourly""
4. Specify correct date and time zone
5. Select ""Group 1"" deal type (Cash Forwards & Index Forwards)
6. Select ""Show EOL ID""
7. Click OK

You should see a format similar to the blotter on your screen within seconds. From there you can monitor STWHOURLY online trading regardless of who's doing it by hitting the ""Refresh"" button periodically.

Please let me know if you have any questions about this.

"Enron Board Elects New Corporate Secretary","I am pleased to announce that the Enron Board has elected Paula Rieker as corporate secretary, effective immediately.  She will replace Rebecca Carter, who has served in that role since 1999.  Paula will have dual reporting responsibility to me and to Jim Derrick, executive vice president and general counsel.

Paula joined Enron in 1990 and has experience in a variety of functions, including assistant treasurer for Enron Corp., vice president and chief financial officer of Enron Global Power & Pipelines, and vice president of Financial Initiatives in Accounting.  Most recently, she has been managing director of Investor Relations, where she has worked for the past four years.  Paula will continue in a dual role with IR through mid-October.  Paula has a bachelor's degree in finance from Texas A&M University, and she is a Certified Public Accountant.

Rebecca has been with the company for 11 years and served in a variety of capacities.  I want to thank Rebecca for her many years of service to Enron.  I am sorry she has decided to leave, but am grateful she will stay on through the end of January to ensure a smooth transition of her duties.  

Please join me in congratulating Paula on her new responsibilities and in wishing Rebecca well in her future endeavors.

"Update","There have been no ""official"" developments relating to Enron North America or the Portland office that I am aware of since the floor meeting on Wednesday.  The news of the Europe office closing so suddenly has certainly been unsettling.  Absent any tangible news pertaining to the fate of our office I thought that I could, at a minimum, try to explain to people what I've seen going on over the last couple of days.

On the trading side we are doing several things.  First, we are trying to honor as many of our physical delivery obligations as possible.  Several customers have stopped making deliveries to us which is making it impossible for us, in turn, to honor all of our physical deliveries.  In these circumstances we are constantly updating our customers on the status of their schedules so that they can make alternative arraingements.  The Cash Trading, Scheduling, Services, and Real Time groups are doing an unbelievable job with this.  I am impressed at how capable, professional, and calm our team has remained.  On the Term Trading side we are working with our customers to close out positions.  This process is going very smoothly as well.  We traded a record volume yesterday as our customers reduced their exposure to us.  The Term trading team has done an excellent job with this.  Third, on the Middle Market and Origination side we are trying to work with customers to bring cash in the door.  Many customers owe us money due to out of the money future positions.  Many customers would prefer to settle up with us now rather than in bankruptcy if that is what ends up happening to us.  We have brought a significant amount of cash in the door as a result of these efforts and saved our customers from going through a potentially onerous bankruptcy proceeding.  I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination and Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.

On the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the North America gas and power businesses.  While it is impossible to handicap anything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this front.  Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.  I don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what form the core business takes as a result.  Chris Calger and I have been part of the team talking to our potential suitors.  We will both be in Houston through the weekend and into early next week working on this.  We will update people as soon as possible as things unfold.

I know that this situation really sucks.  Given the anxiety and uncertainty that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and staying positive.  I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from here -- most likely in the next week or two.  Please hang in there.

Tim

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Supported Internet Email Addresses","Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

"Security Bulletin","
The FBI has uncorroborated evidence of possible terrorist attacks against the United States.  Reportedly, unspecified groups are targeting suspension bridges on the West Coast beginning Friday, Nov. 2 and continuing through Wednesday, Nov. 7, 2001.

No further information about this alleged attack is known at this time.  The FBI is attempting to verify the validity of this report.  In the meantime, California officials are increasing security at the state's suspension bridges, and the National Guard has been authorized to assign troops to protect the bridges.

We shared this information with our West Coast employees earlier in the day.  In the current circumstances, we are likely to see these bulletins fairly frequently.  We don't want to alarm you, but we do want to keep you informed, so we will continue to disseminate this information.

Subject:	RE: list of charges

Here are the invoices for TXU, Reliant and CP&L.  When you use the files, refer to the READ ME worksheet first.  Choose the invoice that matches your customer's characteristics. 

   

These aren't necessarily the final rates or the final rules for implementing them.  The PUCT is expected to issue updated rates within the next couple of weeks.  Furthermore, there is the risk of legal challenges to the rates. 

It is not a straightforward exercise to calculate these rates on a $/MWh basis.  Ken Farrar in the tariff group created a T&D estimator model to do just this.  He intends to update it to include any changes to the rates and to reflect interruptibility tariffs.  I can show you how to use the file.

  

I have saved all of these documents in:  m:/Electric/ERCOT Orig/Ahn Folder/T&D/

Terrell, Could you please get Larry, Matthew and I a summary of the charges listed on the sample invoice I gave you before for large industrials in TXU, Reliant, and CPL on a $/MWh basis.  When we talk to customers I would like a reference sheet that we can refer to to know things like T&D is approx. $x/MWh etc.

Thanks, - Mike

"Change of Control Provisions","
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

"Evening Peak and MEETING NEXT TUESDAY at 4:30.","Group-
Brace yourselves...
Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling. 

Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.

Thanks,

Bill

"FW: Morrow Power","Additional information. 

Morrow's energy will be selling firm in the hourly market. 

Also, PNGC (the marketer for Umitilla Electric whose service territory Morrow is located) would like Enron to give their RT group a courtesy call when starting the unit. They can be reached at 503-287-1205.

Stan will be able to answer any questions.

Subject:	Morrow Power

Real Time Traders,

Morrow Power wants to take their unit to the market to get some run time before they begin selling Firm energy. So I'd like the Real Time group to sell the unit at the best price in the hourly market. 

I've already bought gas for Friday and Saturday operations. I expect Sunday to be weak to not run the unit on Sunday. I would expect to be back in the market on  Monday. 

To sell the unit buy a BPA wheel using the accounts on the scheduling sheet. The variable price at the bottom is actual breakeven price. 

To start the unit call PGE at the control room number and give them an hour to get the unit online before you sell. It takes 46 minutes to get the unit from cold start to full load and online.

Also, I've bought reserves from BPA to make these schedules firm for the hour. 

I'll be out this afternoon and tomorrow and Stan will be standing in for me. I'll be available on my cell phone for any questions.

Les

Subject:	URM Opening


We currently have an opening(s) in the Utility Risk Management (URM) group reporting to Steve Swain.  Based upon the candidate skill level, the opening(s) will be at the Specialist, Sr. Specialist or Analyst level.

Responsibilities will include:
Building and maintaining forward price curves for a number of utility tariff rates across the WSCC.
Tracking and analyzing URM's portfolio of retail positions.
Preparing daily reports for management that analyze various factors contributing to changes in positions, P/L, hedges, etc.
Performing research and analysis on legislative and regulatory changes that could impact our price cuves and/or positions.
Working closely with the Retail Gen desk to coordinate activities involved in managing EWS's overall retail position.
Research to support the development of effective hedging strategies for the various risk exposures inherent to the URM book.

The ideal candidate(s) will possess sound Excel modeling skills (including at least superficial knowledge of Visual Basic), some familiarity with database systems and/or experience collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, excellent organizational skills, and a solid understanding of financial statements.  While some experience with regulated tariffs and utility cost of service modeling would be helpful, it is not necessary.

For those interested in learning more about the position, or about URM in general, Steve Swain and Gordon Savage will be hosting a Brown Bag Info  Session on Friday, 10/5 from 12-1 PM in Mt. Hood.
 
If you are interested in this opportunity, please let Julie Kearney know by close of business on Friday 10/5.

"Daily Update","
Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

"Daily Update","
Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

"Recruiting and Floor Buildout","During the past few days several people have approached us wondering why we are continuing to do college recruiting and continuing with the floor build out given the state of the company today.  We appreciate people's concerns about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be reducing unnecessary expenses.  Let us begin by saying that we share these concerns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditures without a great deal of thought.  We would also encourage people to talk to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing certain things.  In short, we have decided to continue with the college recruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.  We have decided to delay the beginning of the floor build out for a couple of weeks.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a presence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading schools in the northwest.  This past year we finally reached critical mass and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.  Although we are uncertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best long term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the northwest.  We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at most schools.  We have identified the best people from each school and have already made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.  The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as participants in their on-campus recruiting programs.  We also realize that it is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.  It is our belief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities of employment may be somewhat diminished.  Finally, we would like to emphasize the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.  We will interview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions based on the needs of the office.  Before extending offers we will consider the potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron employees in other offices who have been redeployed.  Stated another way, we don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enron who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people already here at risk.  We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are more certain about the state of affairs in the company.

How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.  While we still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause for a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money on this.  When talking to the build out team today it became clear that delaying would accomplish several goals.  First, it allows us to get final architectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can more precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.  Second, it gives the build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move.  Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right now.  While we still think that we are going to move forward with this project, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do right now.  In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team with firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, or delay again.  

As always, we will try to keep people updated on things as soon as new, reliable information becomes available.  We recognize that this is a very hard time for everyone.  Please try to stay focused on the job at hand and keep up the success of this office.

"IMPORTANT-To All Domestic Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp Savings Plan","
If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

"Parking & Mass Transit Resolution","We have reached resolution regarding the parking and mass transit issue.  Until notified otherwise, the parking and mass transit subsidy will continue as an employee benefit. 

For those who have a payroll parking deduction, your deduction has been stopped.  No deduction should occur on 12/31/01 payroll.  In addition, you should receive a credit for the deduction taken for the 12/15 payroll.  

For those who incurred any out-of-pocket parking costs during the month of December, you may expense up to $89 for reimbursement.  

Beginning 1/1/02, parking and mass transit will continue as follows:

WTC Parking:  You should receive your parking pass in the mail. Payroll deductions will begin on the 1/15/02 paycheck. (No Action Req'd)

Outside Parking Lots:  Park at lot of your choice and pay out of pocket.  Request reimbursement of up to $89 per month. (No payroll parking deduction will occur)

Tri-Met and MAX employees:  Passes are available for January.  If you would like to pick up your pass, please see Debra Davidson.   

NOTE:  Extra Tri-Met passes are available.  If you would like to select mass transit as your parking option, please notify either Grace or myself before Friday, 12/21/01 EOB and we will insure a monthly pass is available.

Validations:  We will no longer validate parking passes, however, you are able to reimburse up to $89 per month for daily parking.

If you have any questions, please let us know!

"Get Your Blazers Tickets (See Instructions) - Mt. Hood, October 29; 11:30 a.m.","If you work in West Power Trading, congratulations!  All West Power Trading employees are eligible to receive a pair of tickets to a Blazers game this season, compliments of Enron.  If you are interested in getting a pair of tickets to a Blazer game, come by Mt. Hood Conference Room at 11:30 a.m., Monday, October 29.  If you are unable to attend, ask your manager or another employee to represent you in the drawing.

We will draw employee names from a hat (or container) to determine the order of selection.  When your name is drawn, you can sign up for the date that works best for you by signing your name next to the available date on the signup sheet.   You will have one minute to write your date selection on the signup sheet.  

Guidelines for using the tickets are as follows.
  - Eligible employees can receive a pair of tickets.
  - The employee who is given the tickets must attend the game.
  - Tickets cannot be sold or given away.
  - The guest can be a friend, spouse, or another Enron employee.
  - If the employee cannot attend the game, the tickets must be returned to me or Debra.
  - Any complaints about this process or the guidelines will result in forfeiture of tickets.

Call me or Debra if you have any questions.

"Media Reports","
As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

Craig -

Our records indicate that you have not taken your pre-employment drug test for UBS.  Can you please do so ASAP, or if you have already completed, can you please let me know the date that you went so that we can update our records.

Thanks!

"WTC Power Testing","          This Sunday, starting at 5:00 AM, Emergency Power Systems for the WTC Complex will shut down to test the emergency backups. 

This will not affect critical systems (computer room, phones, or the Real Time Group), as they are on both UPS and Generator. 

It will affect many of the non - critical computers and office machines on the 3rd and 4th floors of Enron. 
Please make every effort to power down all of your PC's and monitors when you leave for the day. Also, if you could help with a machine or 2 in your immediate area we would appreciate it. 

The IT group will be coming through around 4-4:30 today to power down equipment not in use and I will be in before the outage on Sunday to complete this. 

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the IT dept. at any time. 
Regards 
Dave Steiner

...

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:  

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.  
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

"Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture","Enron In Talks With 3 Financial Companies For Joint Venture 
Updated: Monday, December 3, 2001 06:52 PM ET 
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. is negotiating with three financial institutions of ""impeccable creditworthiness"" regarding a joint venture aimed at restarting its trading operation, said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for the company. 
Enron expects to announce its joint venture partner within weeks, according to Bienenstock. 
The joint venture would use that institution's financial means to guarantee that Enron would pay its bills. 
Also Monday, at a court hearing Enron announced $1.5 billion in debtor in possession financing from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. 
The company said that it needs about $250 million for immediate operating needs. Currently, Enron has about $500 million in cash.

"Enron Update","
This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.
