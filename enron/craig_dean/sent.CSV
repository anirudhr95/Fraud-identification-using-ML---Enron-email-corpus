Hello all!

Jon Koomey, the instructor for your Tricks of the Trade (Energy Math) course, has requested participant feedback regarding his class. If you have any comments or suggestions, please e-mail Jon at numbers@numbersintoknowledge.com and copy me as well.

For your convenience, I have included questions from other course evaluations to help guide your thoughts. Feel free to include other comments or suggestions.

Was the presentation of information clear and at the right level of detail?  Did the presenter keep the course interesting?
For a course held entirely in one day, the level of detail was effective.  The course was interesting with the real life examples and the challange problem solving in groups.  The visual aids could use some improvement.  I have no specific ideas, but I found the consistent nature of the material to create a lull in the presentation.
Were there any topics discussed that you would have liked greater detail on?
Current events.  I liked the bit on the Kyoto Treaty
Were there any topics covered that you did not find beneficial or relevant?
I've systematically erased them from my memory...too late to recall
Were there any topics that you would have liked information on that were not included in the seminar?
Currency conversions as they relate to production costs
Did you find the group and individual exercises useful?  Do you have any changes or recommendations for the exercises that you would have found more beneficial?
The individual exercises were the most useful.  It encourages the attendees to work together and think through a problem.
How well was the day structured?  For example, did the course cover too much or too little information, would you have preferred more or less group work, etc.
More group work.  Although you are limited w/one day groups
On a scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the best), how would you rate this course for usefulness and relevance to your work?
8.5
Other Comments:
      Good course...I was a bit worried in the first hour as we focused on compilation errors for data gathering
If you have any questions, please let me know!

Regards,
Grace

"Air Products load questions","Mike,
We need to know the volumes of their load and how it is broken down.  This would include location (by zone), ramp rates, and load factors.  Also, we need to know how fast the load can react to instructions, and how flexible the load is, i.e. can the load be moved up and down on an interval basis without causing problems?  We would also need to know their load forecast.  For example, when is the load available to be reduced, summers, on-peak, etc.?  Obviously if this is limited, we would want to value it accordingly.

Thanks,
Clint

"RE:","I promised I looked for you that night.  Did you go to the APB party at Grasshopper?  Last of four nights, huh?  I remember those days about 3 years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day weekend, and are back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for the band I was playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there, but it was probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from Austin.  You need to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a Halloween party this weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you planning any more trips back to Houston?

"Tag #39474","Cara,

Alicia @ Dynegy ultimately decided to cut this schedule as per my call with her at 16:54 PPT
I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55
and Steve @PPM @ 17:21, (because he called me)

Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point.
I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)


I had a long conversation w/
Matt (Pacificorp)
Steve (PPM)
and Karen (Chelan)
-We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.

Note:
Steve (PPM) asked me @ 17:21 if Chelan still wants the energy ( I didn't know and Karen is gone at this time)

CRAIG!
What the hell have you been up to?  I just got your email address from Carl. 
  I havent talked to him in about 2 years either.  Last year I tried 
everything to get your address so you could come to my wedding.  I got 
married last July.  My wife, Jennifer, is just finishing up at the U, so she 
is a little younger than us, but she's really cute, intelligent, blah, 
blah....  Anyway, are you still in Portland?  I heard you were working at 
Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing 
anymore, so either give me a call, or I can give you a call if you send your 
number.  I'd love to catch up.  My cell:  206-293-1459.  Call after 2:30 
(yes, that is the end of my work day)  Hope to hear from you soon.

Ollie

"","Amy, 
Thank you for my birthday card.  I really appreciate it.  I'm sorry, but I've been meaning to call you.  I just haven't been able to make the time.  I was in Austin this past weekend for the UT football game, and I stayed with Bryan and Monica.  We went out on the lake on Sunday, and I went skiing.  It was fun.  I'm going to a Halloween party at my manager's house this Saturday.  Also, I've been dating as many girls as possible.  Ah, the single life.

Also note that some of BPA's network transmission fees have increased by $2.

"RE:","What's up with your schedule?  You always seem to be working nights.  

Things around here have been better.  We aren't very happy with what has happened to this co. over the past couple of months.  At least the rumors have stopped, and now we know what will become of Enron.  I'm just not sure how everyone will handle the change to Dynegy (or even if the merger will get completed).  Its not supposed to close until around Sept. '02.  So there is plenty of time for things to change even more around here.  As far as my job, at least I work in the power side.  We keep hearing that they bought us for our power and gas trading, so that makes me feel a little better.  I'm also glad that it is a Houston co. that bought us.  We are supposed to be moving into our new building this weekend, so that will be interesting.

Have fun over Thanksgiving.

I hung out

left early

can't decide

I feel so
	   lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

	   I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
lost my
	   voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
Needless
	   to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
everyone was
	   happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
other than
	   the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

	   Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
