"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

To:		All Enron Employees

From:	Raymond Bowen, Jr.
		EVP, Finance & Treasurer

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

"Lunch on Thursday","Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter ""we"" or ""our"" or ""us"" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (""Lunch"") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (""Beer"") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

"Welcome to Microsoft .NET Passport!","Hello craig.dean@enron.com:

Thank you for registering for a Microsoft
 .NET Passport at a participating Web site. 

Use the e-mail address (craig.dean@enron.com) and password you provided during registration to sign in instantly at any .NET Passport-enabled Web site that displays the .NET Passport sign-in button. 

If you also created a Passport wallet, you can use it to make faster, easier purchases at sites that offer the Passport express purchase service. (If you didn't create a Passport wallet and you would like to, we'll tell you how below.) 

You can see a list of .NET Passport sites at: http://www.passport.com/directory.asp.

The rest of this e-mail message contains important information about how to use your .NET Passport. You may want to refer back to it on occasion, so please save it or print a copy.

TO SIGN IN AND SIGN OUT AT A .NET Passport-ENABLED SITE

TO SIGN IN, click the "".NET Passport sign in"" button on the site, and then type your e-mail address and password in the sign-in box that appears. You can sign in to some .NET Passport-enabled sites simply by typing your e-mail address and password directly in the .NET Passport sign-in box on that site's home page (without first clicking the .NET Passport sign-in button).

After you sign in to one .NET Passport-enabled site, you can sign in to any other just by clicking the "".NET Passport sign in"" button on each site. 

TO SIGN OUT, click the "".NET Passport sign out"" button on the site. Clicking this button at any site will sign you out of all .NET Passport-enabled sites.

TO CREATE YOUR PASSPORT WALLET AND USE PASSPORT EXPRESS PURCHASE

You need a Passport wallet to use the Passport express purchase service. A Passport wallet is a secure, convenient way to store your credit card and billing/shipping address information online.

You can create your Passport wallet now at: https://wallet.passport.com.

To make an online purchase using the information stored in your Passport wallet, click the ""Passport express purchase"" button at a participating site, sign in to .NET Passport (if you're not already signed in), and choose which credit card and shipping address you want to use. Your information will be sent to the site instantly, over a secure connection.

IF YOU FORGET YOUR PASSWORD

Click this link to create your new password at the .NET Passport Web site:
https://memberservices.passport.com/ppsecure/MSRV_ResetPW.asp

OTHER IMPORTANT .NET Passport LINKS

If you want to view or change your .NET Passport or wallet, or if you need help, visit .NET Passport Member Services at: http://www.passport.com/memberservices.asp. 

NET Passport is committed to protecting your privacy. We encourage you to review our privacy statement at: http://www.passport.com/privacypolicy.asp.

For more information about .NET Passport, visit: http://www.passport.com.

IF CLICKING A LINK DOESN'T WORK...

Copy it, and then paste it into your Web browser's address bar. 
Select the entire link (which starts with http:// and may include more than one line) and then copy it, usually by clicking the ""Edit"" menu item and then clicking ""Copy"". Next, open your Web browser and click in the box where you usually see the Web page address. Paste the link into this box (usually by clicking ""Paste"" in the ""Edit"" menu) and click ""Go"" or ""Enter"". 

Thank you for using your .NET Passport!

Clint, 
November 10th is Tori's birthday party.  No way I could make the game.  We'll have family in from out of town to entertain.  
Oh, how the weekends fill up.  I'm glad to hear that you'll be hanging out with us Saturday night and Sunday.  If the weather cooperates, we'll try to get the boat out.
See you Sat. night.  Tell your brother that I said Hello and that we need to go get a cheesesteak at Texadelphia.

However, Scott's hookup for tickets fell through.  Therefore, we will be 
watching it at my house.  It would probably be rude of me to go with you 
and leave them there.  You should come over after the game.  And, you are 
welcome to stay with us Saturday night.  We need to catch up.  We may go 
out on the boat Sunday if the weather is nice.

"Schedule confirmation","Starting a few days ago, Lotus notes has been eliminated as a format for inputing schedule confirmation and cut schedule information.  The new process is done in Enpower.  Cara sent a notice out last week and I have left a copy of the new process instruction manual on the Real Time desk.  Please take the time to check it out.  For our purposes we will basically only need to read thru the Path Confirmation instructions.  I had a chance to test out this new process a few weeks ago and it is far better than Lotus Notes and works effectively.  If you have any questions feel free to ask Cara or myself.

Texas-Oklahoma Game Set for 2:30 P. M., National ABC Telecast

The big showdown next week between top five powers Texas and Oklahoma in
Dallas has been set for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff and will be televised nationally
by ABC.
Both teams are unbeaten, but both face tough tests this week. The Sooners,
ranked No. 3 nationally, face No. 11 Kansas State, and the Longhorns, ranked
No. 5, play unbeaten Texas Tech.
* * * *
Coach Mack Brown said Monday he thinks the Longhorn offense has been steadily
improving this season, but he said the defense has reverted to last year's
problem of being victimized by what he called ""off-schedule plays."" You and I
call those misdirection plays, but, by any terminology, they were a major
problem for the Texas defense in Saturday night's 53-26 victory at Houston.
""We have to do a better job on off-schedule plays,"" Brown said. ""We're going
to work on that a lot this week. We need to tackile better and we need to do
a better job of recognizing what the other team is doing.""
With Texas Tech and Oklahoma, two teams who love misdirection, filling the
next two spots on the schedule, it could be fatal to the Longhorns' lofty
ambitions unless they show a lot of improvement in tackling and recognizing
misdirection plays.
Texas leads the Big 12 in scoring, averaging 46 points per game, but Tech is
No. 2 with a 42-point average.
Brown said the Longhorns have to get a much better defensive performance
against Tech than they got against Houston ""or we'll get beat.""
He also said Texas will have a real challenge in trying to corral Tech QB
Kliff Kingsbury, one of the nation's top passers, and TB Ricky Williams, who
is averaging 74.5 yards per game rushing and is the Big 12's leading
receiver, averaging 10 catches per game for 95 yards.
""He's very dangerous on those short passes,"" Brown said of Williams. ""He's
completely healthy for the first time in a long time and he's one of the most
dangerous backs in the country.""
Linebackers have to do a good job on Williams or he has a big day. Since
linebacker play is not a strength on this Longhorn team, we need to hope the
Texas offense has a great day.
I think freshman LB Derrick Johnson is already the team's best linebacker,
but he didn't see any first-half action at Houston. He made an immediate
impact when he came in early in the third quarter.
Brown said Johnson and RB Cedric Benson are potentially great players, but he
said both ""have only been going to class in college for about two or three
weekis."" He said the coaches have to simplify offensive and defensive
assignments when they play because they haven't had time to learn everything
they need to know.
""Derrick is so talented and he has a real nose for the ball,"" Brown said.
""He's one of the best athletes coming out of high school that I've seen."" But
he said defensive coordinator Carl Reese ""has a pretty complicated system and
we're bringing him along as fast as we can.""
He said Johnson and Benson will see more action as the season progresses and
they learn more about their assignments.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: Texas still has 14 commitments. The two super linebackers
who are still uncommitted - Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Marvin
Byrdsong of Longview - have had some changes in their list of favorites
recently. Harris had been a strong lean to Texas, but he told me today he
likes Texas, Oklahoma and Texas A&M all about the same. ""I don't really have
a favorite,"" he said. ""They're all about even."" But Byrdsong, who has a
brother at Mississippi State and who had been leaning toward the Bulldogs,
now says he really likes Texas. I think Texas can get both of them if the
Horns beat OU and A&M and if Byrdsong continues to make some progress in the
classroom. . . It looks like DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos has a good chance
to keep his Longhorn scholarship. Brown shies away from problem kids as a
rule, but Anderson, who was arrested on two misdemeanor charges last week,
had never been in any trouble before and that will help him. He committed to
Texas several weeks ago. . . But the Longhorns don't appear likely to offer a
scholarship to the state's top WR, Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus,
because his latest suspension is just another in a long line of problems. By
the way, when I put stuff like this in my e-mail/faxes, I don't want to see
it on the internet. I can't give you the inside scoop on things like this if
it goes public because these kids and their coaches read the internet and it
could hurt the Longhorns' recruiting. I want to give you the true picture,
but I can't if you don't cooperate on this.

(10-1/7-1 Big 12) and No. 14 Colorado (9-2/7-1 Big 12) opened at 10 a.m.
Sunday, Nov. 25. To order tickets, call 800/982-BEVO (2386) or 512/471-3333.
The UT ticket office will stay open until 5 p.m. and will reopen Mondayat
8:30 a.m. Prices are $60 and $70. The deadline to place your order for next
weekend's game is Monday at 7 p.m. (CT). Expect delays on phone orders due to
the large number of callers.

Only 8,250 tickets were given to each of the the two competing teams. Tickets
will be available to Texas season ticket holders who are Longhorn Foundation
members, football letterwinners or voting faculty members. Ten percent of the
tickets will be set aside for student ticket orders.

If you can't get a ticket through normal channels, a lot of disappointed
Nebraska and Oklahoma fans (HOW SWEET IT IS) are going to be selling the ones
they bought through the conference office earlier. Check the newspaper ads
and the internet sites.

Big 12 Roundup

Nebraska ran its home winning streak to 20 games and ended Oklahoma's string
of 20 straight victories Saturday in Lincoln.
Nebraska continues to lead the Northern Division with a perfect record, but
Oklahoma fell into a three-way tie with Texas and Texas A&M in the Big 12
South at 4-1.
The most important game this week has Texas A&M playing at Texas Tech. The
Red Raiders have been hard for the Aggies to handle in Lubbock in recent
years.

Buckman Picks Horns

Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound power forward from Austin Westlake who was
recruited by most of the nation's top programs, picked Texas Tuesday, saying
he thinks the Horns are on the verge of joining the national elite in
basketball.
He chose Texas over North Carolina at the end, but also had considered
Kentucky, UCLA, Missouri and others.
He had said earlier that the lure of the ACC, where basketball reigns
supreme, was very strong and almost pulled him to North Carolina.
But he told me Tuesday, ""I've always wanted to go to Texas. This is where my
heart is.""
He also said his head turned Texas' way at the end because coach Rick Barnes
has established a consistent winning program and has been wooing and winning
big-time recruits
""After looking at it closely,"" he said, ""I think Texas basketball is really
on the upswing. They've signed two McDonald's All Americans (freshman point
guard T. J. Ford of Fort Bend Willowridge and sophomore forward Brian
Boddicker of Duncanville) in the last two years.""
They could make it three in three years because Buckman's stock soared this
summer when he starred in several top AAU tournaments.
Brick Oettinger, publisher of Prep Stars Recruiter's Handbook, was asked who
was the biggest surprise of the summer.
Oettinger said, ""In terms of from out of nowhere - not in anybody's top 100
to everybody's top 25 - it would be Brad Buckman. Big forward, very
aggressive and a whole lot of skills - just about as many skills as . . .
anybody in the class. I've got him No. 21 now and he wasn't in my top 100.
Dave Telep, another national recruiting analyst, agreed Buckman is a national
top 25 recruit.
""The reality is that while there are 25 guys with larger names, there
probably aren't 25 better players in the class,"" Telep said. ""He is athletic,
can handle it some, he blocks shots, he shoots to medium-range and he scores
in the post.""
Clifton McNeely, the Westlake coach, also says his star's work ethic is off
the chart.
""He's a very gifted player with a lot of talent,"" McNeely said, ""but the best
thing about him is his strong heart and work ethic. I don't think you could
find anyone who works harder than he does."" McNeely also said he thinks
Buckman ""is the best player in Texas.""
There are some guards in the Dallas area who ranked higher nationally,
including Bracy Wright of The Colony, who chose Indiana, Daniel Horton of
Cedar Hill, who picked Michigan, and Bryan Hopkins of Dallas Lincoln, who
committed to SMU.
The Longhorns recruited all three of those star guards, but lost out on them
at the end.
Buckman averaged 20 points, 11 rebounds and 5 blocks for Westlake as a
junior. And he's the kind of blue-collar inside player Barnes loves.
McNeely said Buckman can play a power game inside and shoot from 3-point
range.
Asked to compare him to Luke Axtell and Chris Mihm, two other Westlake
players he coached who played at UT, he said, ""He has the physical presence
of Mihm and is a lot stronger coming out of high school, and he has the range
of Luke.""
He is the first recruit to commit to Texas for the early signing period next
month.
Barnes and his assistants are recruiting several other players, most of them
in other states, and hope to sign a  sharp shooting guard and a wing.
Buckman's  father, Brent, played on two national championship golf teams at
UT.

Basketball Team Has New Look

The Longhorn basketball team will have a new look this season with the
addition of heralded point guard T. J. Ford, who led Fort Bend Willowridge to
back-to-back Class 5A state titles.
When the season starts next month, Ford will be called upon to speed up the
Horns' offense and also create more opportunities for the team's inside
players with his lightning-quick passes.
Coach Rick Barnes is hoping Ford's creativity in the half-court offense will
improve the scoring punch of center James Thomas, who averaged 7 points and
6.5 rebounds a game last year.
Ford also should be able to provide better shooting opportunities for senior
forward Chris Owens, sophomore wings Brandon Mouton and Royal Ivey, and 6-9
forward Brian Boddicker.
Barnes had to operate without a true point guard last year. Fredie Williams,
Ivey and shooting guard Darren Kelly took turns at the point.
Barnes and the Horns coped with it admirably, going 25-9 overall and 12-4 in
the tough Big 12, but they shot only 41.2 percent from the field and had 88
more turnovers than assists. Ford should help raise the former and lower the
latter.
They also lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Temple, and
Barnes hopes Ford will be a key to helping the team get farther into the
playoffs this season.
Replacing departed wing Maurice Evans and Kelley, who combined for 30.8 of
UT's 70.5 per-game scoring average, creates scoring opportunities for other
shooters. Now Barnes just needs some of them to seize that opportunity.
He expects Mouton and Ivey to step up there. Sydmill Harris, a 6-6 freshman
from The Netherlands, has been a consistent shooter in pre-season workouts.
Owens was a star in the World University Games during the summer and is
expected to be one of the top players in the Big 12, and a more dependable
scoring threat.
""Ever since last year, the Temple game, it started coming together,"" Owens
said. ""It clicked. I didn't do what I wanted to do and I knew I had the
ability. Now I have the mental concentration.""

UT Women Looking Sharp

Coach Jody Conradt's Longhorn women's basketball team is picked to finish in
the middle of the Big 12 pack, but early practices and stiff competition at
several positons indicate it might be a lot better than that.
The Longhorns were looking good early last season before losing
center-forward Annissa Hastings and guardTai Dillard to knee injuries.
Hastings and Dillard are hale and hearty once again, but equally important is
the fact that the Horns' heralded recruiting class is living up to its  hype.
Stacy Stephens, a 6-1 sophomore, returns as the starting center, and 6-2
senior Tracy Cook and the 6-1 Hastings can back her up and also play power
forward.
Jody Bell, a 6-2 freshman from Canada, and 6-1 freshman Mercedes Williams
also are looking good at power forward.
Two freshmen - 6-3 Heather Schreiber, the high school player of the year in
Texas last year, and 6-2 Kala Bowers, last year's high school player of the
year in Oklahoma - are battling for the small forward job (it shows you are
on the right track when you can call 6-3 and 6-2 women small forwards).
Hastings is so versatile that she probably will see action at all three
inside positions.
Kenya Larkin returns as the point guard and other guards who will see a lot
of action include sophomore Kaira White, who has been looking great in
practice, plus Dillard and freshman CoCo Reed.
Alisha Sare and Asha Hill are other guards who could figure into the rotation.
RECRUITING NOTES: LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, picked Texas
Tech over Texas last week. Nichelle Roberts, a 6-1 center-forward who teamED
with Mercedes Williams to lead Spring Westfield deep into the state playoffs
last year, is the only remaining uncommitted blue chipper and the Longhorns
have a great chance to sign her.

No. 10 Horns Win Soccer Title

The No. 10 Texas women's soccer team clinched its first Big 12 Conference
title Sunday with a 3-1 victory over Oklahoma.
The Longhorns are 11-3 overall and 9-0 in the Big 12 and have one regular
season match remaining against Texas A&M.
Coach Chris Petrucelli, in his third year at the helm, said, ""This is a huge
step for us. It's going to help us in recruiting. It's going to help us in
marketing. And it's going to help our confidence.""
Freshman forward Kelly Wilson scored Texas' third goal Sunday, giving her 11
for the season and tying her with Carol Finch for the season record. Finch
set the record in 1996.
Lerrin Biggers scored Texas' first goal and Kylee Wosnuk got the second one.

Republican members of the Energy and Air  Quality Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee have agreed with  Subcommittee Chairman Joe Barton, R-Texas, that restructuring legislation should  move forward now that Congress has a few more weeks in session. In an 8-2 vote  last week, Republican Committee members decided to continue drafting electricity  restructuring legislation. Electricity restructuring provisions were excluded  from the energy bill approved by the House earlier this year. The issue was to  be readdressed in the fall but was delayed due to the events on September 11th.  No action has been taken to date in the Senate.
Green Mountain Energy Expands Into  Ohio's Restructured Market
Green Mountain Energy Company has  entered into an agreement with the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council (NOPEC)  to service northeastern Ohio with solar and wind-generated electricity. NOPEC  was formed last year under Ohio's utility deregulation statute Senate Bill 3,  which allows local governments to serve as aggregators for electricity  customers. NOPEC consists of 100 local communities with approximately 500,000  energy customers. Under the agreement, Green Mountain Energy will construct a  25-kilowatt solar array at Lake Farmpark in Kirtland, Ohio, and will conduct a  study to determine the feasibility of siting a wind generating facility in Ohio.  The Green Mountain Energy solar array will be the largest in the state and the  first commercial solar array in Ohio built for the competitive market. The  proposed wind study will be the first commercial wind analysis executed solely  for the competitive market.
Debate Over Deregulation Impacts in  Oklahoma
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has reported, in a  first-of-its kind study, that restructuring Oklahoma's electric industry can  benefit consumers, but problems and potential pitfalls do exist. The report has  been met with some opposition however. Pete Churchwell, president of Oklahoma's  second largest electric utility AEP/PSO, stated on November 16th that he does  not support the study's findings, one of which indicates that Oklahoma's energy  costs could rise between 5 and 25 percent if the retail electricity market is  opened to competition. The study results indicate that lower electric prices may  be available in the short term, but restructuring will ultimately bring higher  prices. Under the state's restructuring plan, existing generating plants will  have a competitive advantage over new plants. This advantage will result in  higher prices in the long term because newer, higher-cost plants may be forced  out of the marketplace. Churchwell contests that it is too early to know for  certain how consumer rates will react in a deregulated market. While admitting  that the nation's grid was not designed for retail competition, Churchwell said  that improvements in state transmission systems would allow a successful retail  competitive market.
Utility still looks to be freed of  generators
Clark Public Utilities has been trying in vain for  two months to unload some of the 50 portable generators that have become a  multimillion-dollar white elephant.  The units, wired in rows near the  River Road Generating Plant, were leased for a year for $19.5 million. The deal  was signed with General Electric early this year, at a time when there were dire  predictions about this summer's power supply.  In addition to the equipment  lease, there is a $15 million natural gas contract to power the generators and a  roughly $12 million expense to transport the gas. While Clark has been able to  resell some of the gas at a loss, the transportation costs can't be  recouped.  For weeks, electricity on the open market has been much cheaper  than that produced by the generators.  In place since July, the generators,  each producing 1 megawatt of power, have run for just 39 days.  Electricity  prices have plunged, from a high of $325 per megawatt-hour this summer to less  than $30 today. The price has to be about $95 to make operating the generators  feasible. So utility officials have had no choice but to let them sit  idle.  In September, the net expense for the generator farm gas, generator  lease and so on was $3.5 million. For no electricity.  Utility officials  have tried to get GE to find customers for at least some of the  generators.  Tuesday morning, Andy Huck, Clark's operations director, said  he had heard from GE about a ""pretty serious inquiry"" for two generators for two  months. And that, he said, ""is the best inquiry they've had so far.""  Now,  utility officials are trying to decide whether to keep spending $62,000 a month  for three GE employees and other expenses associated with maintaining the  generators.  The theory is that the equipment should be tested, a few at a  time, to ensure they will be ready if needed.  ""They told me the generators  need to be 'exercised,'"" said Huck. ""I told them they spent two months on a ship  without being started."" The units were built in Austria.  GE, with a signed  one-year lease in hand, has little incentive to find customers for the  equipment, particularly when the company could presumably lease other generators  from its inventory.  ""They say it's because we're such good client"" that an  effort has been made to find other users for the generators, said Huck. Clark's  $120 million River Road generating plant features a giant GE turbine.   Clark officials don't hold out much hope of getting out from under the generator  lease expense, which runs about $1.3 million per month. ""Where would they go?""  asked Jim Sanders, Clark's director of energy resources.  Meanwhile, the  natural gas supply for the equipment is being resold at about half what it cost  the utility. Gas prices also have fallen since the supply deal was inked.   At their regular Tuesday meeting, utility commissioners decided to proceed with  a $100 million bond sale that includes money to pay for the generator  lease.  In March, Rick Dyer, Clark's finance director, recommended that the  utility cut a deal for a one-year, $100 million ""bond anticipation note."" The  arrangement was made on the assumption that interest rates would fall in a few  months, which they have to 1961 levels.  The move Tuesday gave Dyer and  utility General Manager Wayne Nelson the OK to approve a bond sale of up to 15  years at 6 percent interest although 5 percent or less is more likely, and the  goal is a 10-year term, officials said.  The bond sale likely will occur in  the first week of December. The bulk of the $100 million borrowing is to cover a  $63 million power purchase from Kaiser Aluminum. The deal, like the generator  lease, was for power to cover an August-September gap in Clark's power supply,  before the start of a Bonneville Power Administration contract.  That  Kaiser purchase was at $325 a megawatt-hour. The utility lost a bid to have a  federal judge declare the price exorbitant and order a partial refund.     
AEP, Reliant Named as Last Resort  Providers in Texas
The Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) has  named American Electric Power (AEP) and Reliant Resources affiliates ""providers  of last resort"" (POLR) for residential and small-commercial customers in all or  part of 96 counties within TXU Electric's service area. The POLR becomes the  electricity provider for customers who have been dropped by their past provider  due to payment problems or if their provider has discontinued service in their s  area. AEP and Reliant will offer a retail price that is expected to be 30-34  percent higher than base rates in the area taking effect January 1, 2002. By  becoming the POLR, AEP and Reliant will acquire an additional 2 million  Dallas-area customers and an expected 1-20 percent load increase. Due to the  higher costs associated with such an increased load the PUC was agreeable to the  higher rate. Consumer groups are opposing the higher rates, saying that  low-income consumers will be unfairly hurt. Although many low-income consumers  will qualify for a 10 percent discount advocates are arguing that POLR rates  should equal the regular rates.
Studies Show Changing Consumer Views  Towards Deregulation
A recent study by Deloitte and Touche  Energy Resources Group finds that consumers are less aware of deregulation in  the electric industry and more wary of its potential benefits. The survey  considered the opinions of 657 consumers nationwide and found that the number of  consumers who are aware of changes in retail electric markets has dropped to  39.7 percent, compared with 50.5 percent in 2000. This is a reversal in a  five-year trend of increasing consumer awareness on deregulation. Analysts cited  the terrorist attacks and the lack of federal legislation or debate on  deregulation as reasons for the change. The survey also found that more  consumers expect electric rates to increase with deregulation. Deloitte and  Touche's Brank Terzi reports that a third of consumers expect no benefit from  competition, while 26 percent expect prices to go down, 9 percent expect  improved service, and 15 percent simply ""don't know."" Another study completed by  RKS Research and Consulting similarly found that many consumers feel that  ""deregulation has been a colossal failure."" Their study found that many  consumers who have switched to new service providers have been disappointed  because their service expectations were not met. RKS Senior Vice President  Carmine Grastataro said, ""customers of public power are more satisfied with the  job their utility is doing than are customers of the IOUs. Although this finding  has historically remained true, the difference in performance scores between  public power and IOUs is exacerbated in states where competition is under way.""  The study also found that consumers are more interested in purchasing power  through buying groups, voluntary energy curtailment programs, and on-site  generation.
FERC Postpones December 15 RTO  Deadline
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has  officially decided to postpone the December 15, 2001, deadline for utilities to  create four regional transmission organizations (RTO). FERC Chairman Pat Wood  said of the decision, ""RTO development is in very different stages in various  parts of the country, and it is not possible for all RTOs to be in operation by  the December 15, 2001, deadline established in Order 2000."" The commission has  approved a rulemaking order, RM01-12, that addresses the development of RTOs in  several steps. First, the Commission will develop a broader definition of the  expected functions of an RTO and how they can be achieved. Second, FERC will  seek improved input and communication from both state and federal agencies on  RTO development. Third, FERC will conduct a formal cost benefit analysis of RTO  systems. This comes in response to two conflicting studies: NY ISO reports that  a large Northeast RTO could cause power rates to increase by $90 million, while  Mirant contends that a Northeast RTO could save consumers $440 million. The  rulemaking also calls for FERC to determine areas in which standardization can  be improved. Lastly, a new ""progressive"" timeline will be developed that  addresses RTO development in a region-by-region approach. While Chairman Wood  said that the commission is holding to its original concept of four RTOs, he  also noted that the new order suggests that three smaller RTOs may be developed  within the Western region. These transmission groups would include RTO West,  Desert Star RTO, and one based on the California ISO. The rulemaking also makes  a call for comments in what Commissioner Nora Brownell noted as possibly the  last opportunity for market participants and state regulators to make  suggestions and raise concerns before final orders are issued.
Ontario deregulation in  doubt 
The planned  deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in  doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity  transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an  open North American power market. The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike  Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a  not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this  happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make  acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's  premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive  officer Eleanor Clitheroe. David Lindsay, the president and chief executive  officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser,  confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to  Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration.  ""We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this  one,"" he said yesterday. He would not provide details, though it is thought that  the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership  structure by the conclusion of the year. A senior official in the Ontario  government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal ""is a step  backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro."" He was referring to the debt-laden  utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating  arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans  30,000 kilometres. The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for  Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that ""there are a number of options on  the table."" Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning  Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the  chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest  dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion  through the sale of bonds to investors. The dealers' commission on the sale of  the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would  range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. Mr. Harris  is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to  the government to help pay down the $21-billion in ""stranded debt"" racked up by  the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long  spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the  province's balance sheet. Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to  electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of  bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One  lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company  instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The  United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial  risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. Executives at RBC  Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality  concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. The  government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and  sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated  turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent  owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the  leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would  be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public  offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the  stock exchange. The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit  organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option,  though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of  which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would  eventually become a commercial enterprise. Sources said that Hydro One  management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One  the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The  not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises  potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies  might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive  advantage. It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially  lucrative share options.  Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president,  would not comment on the not-for-profitoption being contemplated by the  government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability  to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market.  ""Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in  the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,"" he said  in a phone interview. Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall  Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a  not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser  to Hydro One's strategic business plan). In a three-page letter sent this week  to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said  that ""this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario."" He argued that ""the  absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit  corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers."" He also  said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to  invest in ""new bottleneck-eliminating connections"" that would allow the company  to become a significant electricity exporter. ""Ontario would lose the prospect  of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,"" he said. In a  recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote,  ""With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well  positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United  States, where ownership tends to be fragmented."" He noted that Hydro One is  expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has  ""the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into  competitive high-growth initiatives."" According to sources familiar with the  not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of  all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from  corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper  companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the  board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers.  Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the  most efficient way to capitalize the company. ""The problem with a Canadian  National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,"" said  one financier familiar with the proposal. ""With a debt-based structure, every  dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure  means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt  payments."" Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about  $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord  Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's  stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity  charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to  whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year.  ""We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,"" Mr. Forstner said. ""Until  that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding  outside of Ontario's boundaries.""
Retail Access Requested in  California
The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) has  asked the California Supreme Court to overturn the state Public Utilities  Commission's September 20th decision that suspended direct retail access across  the state. The consumer group, comprised of American Utility Network, the  Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, California League of Food Processors,  Western Power Trading Forum, Strategic Energy, AB&I Foundry, Tricon Global  Restaurants and School Project for Utility Rate Reduction, has argued that the  ruling was made without due process and that the Court had no right to abrogate  contracts retroactively. ""It is our hope that the Supreme Court recognizes the  PUC has acted in complete disregard of our constitutional rights and has rushed  to judgment on this issue, without hearings and without creating a proper  evidentiary record,"" said AReM Attorney Dan Douglass. PUC Commissioner Carl Wood  has maintained that the PUC issued the order because it believed that consumers  have hastily signed contracts with competitive suppliers, leaving fewer  customers to pay for the state's wholesale power costs. AReM is disputing the  claim, saying that only a limited number of customers switched suppliers during  the summer of 2001.
Plant Construction Influences  Florida's Wholesale Market
California based Calpine Corporation  announced that it has begun construction of a 530 megawatt power plant in  Auburndale, Florida. The construction brings Florida closer to deregulation, as  Calpine is one of the few out-of-state generating companies to successfully  penetrate Florida's wholesale electricity market. Other companies, such as  Enron, have attempted to construct new power plants in the state, but have been  unsuccessful due to community and regulatory resistance. Florida's stringent  Power Plant Siting Act makes it very difficult for out-of-state companies to  enter the market. Calpine has succeeded by agreeing to sell the output from the  Auburndale plant under a long-term contract to one of Florida's existing  utilities, Seminole Electric Cooperative. In addition, Calpine has been working  with the Florida Partnership for Affordable Competitive Electricity to persuade  lawmakers and Governor Bush to deregulate Florida's wholesale market. Florida's  Energy 2020 Study Commission, which is responsible for the state's competition  plan, has endorsed a proposal to allow out-of-state companies to enter Florida's  wholesale market by building new plants and selling power to the state's  incumbent utilities. The Commission has also suggested eliminating the power of  state government to approve power plant development and limiting the ability of  local governments to block projects. The Commission is expected to issue a final  report on December 1, 2001.
Florida PSC Approves Independent  Power Line Operations
The Florida Public Service Commission  (PSC) has approved the transfer of the state's power lines from utility  jurisdiction to an independent company. The PSC has asked Florida's three main  utilities, Florida Power and Light (FPL), Florida and Power Corporation, and  Tampa Electric, to devise a proposal within 90 days that will turn over  operation of the power lines to an independent system operator. Commissioner  Michael A. Palecki said that the decision was made in the best interest for  ratepayers, utility companies and independent power companies seeking a  competitive market. Under an earlier proposal submitted to the PSC, the  utilities proposed a statewide regional transmission organization, GridFlorida,  that would have owned and managed the power lines. The PSC did not approve the  plan, as it would have moved jurisdiction of retail rates to the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission.
New England Congressmen Seek Equal  Representation on RTO Board
Twenty-three U.S. congressmen from  New England requested that their states be given adequate representation on the  governance of the Northeast Regional Transmission Organization (RTO.) In an  effort organized by Representative Edward Markey (D-Mass), the bipartisan  delegation of congressmen wrote a letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC) asking the regulators to create a governing board comprised of  equal numbers of representatives from New England, New York, and the  Mid-Atlantic. ""We view an equally balanced governance structure as the only way  in which a single market design can be implemented which would truly benefit the  consumers of all the regions,"" Markey said. FERC has been considering several  options for structuring the board that will oversee the unified Northeast  wholesale power market. One proposal gives five seats for representatives from  the Mid-Atlantic, three seats to New York, and two to New England. ISO New  England and New York Independent System Operator joined the congressman in  opposing that plan and requesting equal representation.
California Wants Consumers to See  Real Power Costs
In a move that may prevent a repeat meltdown of  the wholesale electricity market in California, the California Consumer Power  and Financing Authority wants to install electricity meters that charge  consumers the real cost of power. Currently consumers pay the same price for  electricity throughout the day even though the wholesale price varies every  hour. Therefore, consumers have no incentive to conserve during peak times. The  meters will charge residential consumers more for power used during peak hours,  when demand is highest and less during off peak times. The authority issued  requests for proposals, due by November 15, for a minimum of 10,000 real-time  meters, the cost of which varies between $200 and $1,000. The power authority  plans to finance the purchase of the meters and will market them to customers of  Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison, San Diego Gas &  Electric and dozens of municipal utilities. As consumers have shown to be  responsive to price signals in a pilot program in Washington, Californians too  can expect to reduce their energy consumption. Project manger, Kevin Wood of  Southern California Edison hopes his company will install meters for 11,000  customers by next summer. He said that if these customers, who represent 20 to  30 percent of the load, respond to price signals during peak hours, this may in  turn drive down wholesale prices for all users. While consumers may benefit, the  decrease in consumption may cost power generators millions of dollars in  revenue.
Environmentalists and Union Coalition  Oppose Deregulation in Indiana
A coalition of union members from  several groups showed their opposition to electric utility deregulation in  Indiana during a peaceful demonstration on November 7. The coalition, know as  People's Energy Campaign, includes members from UNITE Local 399, formerly the  Ladies Garment Workers Union, the Central Labor Council, Valley Watch  environmental group, and the Citizens Action Coalition. Denny Owen, an executive  board member of UNITE Local 399, expressed the general concern of the coalition  that deregulation should be discouraged. ""We don't think it'll make prices  lower, it'll make them go higher,"" Owen said. Indiana is considered to have low  utility rates compared to other states. Indiana lawmakers are considering  deregulation as newly introduced legislation proposes to create an Energy Policy  Commission that would craft a comprehensive energy plan for the state. Senator  Gard and other General Assembly members created the bill to address the state's  need for a true energy policy and as a means to address future electric load  growth. ""Merchant power plants have been a divisive issue in the past year and a  half,"" Gard said. ""There are many people who feel if the state has a  comprehensive energy policy, it might be better able to deal with this issue.  And we also have to pay attention to what's happened in California."" The bill  would set up a temporary commission with appointed members representing various  stakeholder groups including state government, industry, labor, and  environmental groups. The commission is scheduled to present a final report to  the governor in December 2002. While electric deregulation would not be a prime  focus of the commission, the ""specter of deregulation"" would have to be examined  in some fashion, Senator Gard said. SB 233 has been sent to the Senate Rules and  Legislative Procedures Committee. Senator Gard predicts it will pass the Senate,  although chances in the House of Representatives are less favorable.
Debate Over Oklahoma Transmission  System's Readiness to Serve Future Load
The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee met with industry officials on November 7 to  discuss the future capabilities of Oklahoma's transmission system. The committee  is responsible for researching the capabilities of the system, determining  whether upgrades are necessary, and delegating the responsibility for paying for  such upgrades. With new power plants being developed and proposals to open the  state to a competitive electric market in progress, concern has risen as to  whether the transmission system can handle the increased load. Stanton Hadley of  Oak Ridge National Laboratory reported that electricity demand in Oklahoma is  expected to grow 26 percent, to 14,350 megawatts by 2010. The transmission  system currently is able to handle only 13,300 megawatts. Nevertheless, power  companies are planning 13,500 megawatts of new power generation. Calpine  Corporation is spending about $20 million on transmission improvements between  its power plant near Coweta, Oklahoma, and the outlying region. Also, Public  Service Company of Oklahoma plans to spend $40 million on transmission upgrades  over the next few years. With the new power plants and a supply surplus  expected, Hadley also said that consumers could expect lower costs. John Wright,  one of the committee members questioning this assumption, said that in a  deregulated market, the utilities are likely to sell their power out of state.  If this were to occur, lower power prices would be unlikely. The Electric  Restructuring Advisory Committee will deliver a report to the Legislature at the  end of the year.
Thirty New Power Plants Proposed for  Virginia
The latest news out of the deregulation of Virginia's  electric power industry centers around thirty proposals for new power plants in  the state. While the surge in supply is expected to prevent a California-like  energy crisis, health and environmentalists argue that the air pollution and  smog from the plants could damage the state's parks and forests. Since 1998,  when the state announced its plans to open its energy markets to competition, 30  companies and utilities have asked for state approval to build new plants.  Activists complain that the new power would not even benefit Virginia's  customers, as the energy is intended for delivery in northeastern states. By  building plants in Virginia, utilities avoid the Northeast's stringent  environmental regulations. An advisory group composed of utility and industry  representatives argues that new plants pose no significant risk. They stated  that 28 of the new plants would run on cleaner-burning natural gas and that  other federal regulations would require older plants to reduce harmful emissions  by 65 percent by 2004. The representatives also expect that only a few of the  plants will actually be built due to market conditions and cooling-water  shortages.

 <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" />

Day 4 - October 18, 2001

Afternoon Session

 

Standardizing Markets, Business, and Other Practices 

Panelists for this discussion were:  Sarah Barpoulis, PG&E National Energy Group; William P. Boswell, GISB; Bill Burkes (substituting for David J. Christiano), City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri; David N. Cook, NERC General Counsel; Michael Kormos PJM Interconnection; LeRoy Koppendrayer, Minnesota Public Utilities Commission; and Marty Mennes, Florida Power & Light Company.

 


General Observations


 

The Commissioners were all present the majority of the time (Massey left late in the  afternoon).  FERC Staff was active in the discussion; however, the commissioners were very active as well, asking perhaps as much as 70% of all questions.  There was a general consensus that standards were needed; much discussion focused simply on how much and by who. The Commission seemed very interested in leaning what they needed to do to move the industry forward and how far they needed to go.  Panelists urged the need to mover forward as quickly as possible, but both they and FERC seemed to recognize that some of the issues regarding standardized market design and such needed to be addressed before RTOs could really begin to move forward.  There was discussion on identifying which industry group (NERC or GISB) would take the reins in the future.  On an interesting tangential note, there was noticeable conflict between NERC and GISB, with veiled insults between the two organizations somewhat common during the discussions. 

 


FERC Deliverables


A great deal of the discussions focused on identifying what the industry needed from the Commission.  Staffers probed all panelists to find what they felt was critical.  

The first major topic was ""How many RTOs?  What is their scope?""  All panelists seemed to agree that this question needed to be answered immediately by FERC, in strong definitive language.  N o one offered any specific language, but seemed to be urging FERC to issue a formal statement.

The next topic was, ""What will be standard market design?""  Panelists varied on this, but most felt strong guidance from FERC is urgent.  Some urged for one mandatory design for North America, one supported a set of rigid standard designs, one supported a single design with requests for exceptions (followed by an in-depth review process), and one seemed to prefer the current situation.

The commission in general seemed to be very interested in understanding what the industry needed to move forward.  They continually visited this topic throughout their discussions, asking questions like, ""Do we need to issue a Mega-Order that addresses all these issues?"" and, ""How much detail do you need us to provide?""   General feel from the panelsists seemed to be they wanted strong leadership in this areas.  Kormos and Burkes went so far as to say FERC should ""Mandate as much as they felt comfortable - and then go a little further.""  Others seemed to be a little worried about this idea, but in general did not oppose the concept, citing only general warnings and the need for cautious investigation.  

One item of interest: Wood referred to the filing made by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative and specifically asked if the items identified in the ""RTO Design and RTO Implementation"" section would address many of the questions and uncertainty facing the industry with regard to RTO design.  Kormos indicated that clear and specific answers to these questions specifying a course of action would go a long way toward guiding the industry.  The section to which Wood referred was one that I wrote, and asked the following questions:


?         Congestion Management - When Operational Security Violations occur, how is the system to be stabilized in a fair and equitable manner that is nonetheless efficient?  Will LMP based systems be standard, or will there be others that must be accommodated?


?         Transmission Service  - Are transmission services required to schedule (""covered"" schedules only), or are they risk management tools protecting from congestion charges (both ""covered"" and ""uncovered"" schedules are allowed)? 


?         Loop Flows  - Are contract-path based or flow-based transmission services appropriate?  If contract-path based, how are parallel path issues to be addressed?


?         Grandfathered Transmission Service - Should contracts existing prior to RTO development be transferred, or is there an equitable way to retire those contracts?  Are there other solutions?


?         Energy Imbalance Markets - How are imbalance markets to function? Will they serve as real-time energy markets (support unbalanced schedules), be limited to supplying needs of imbalance service (require balanced schedules), or will they be required at all?


?         Ancillary Services - Will ancillary service markets be developed in standard ways?  Will entities be required to actually schedule ancillary services (required to schedule), or will they be treated primarily as financial instruments (protecting against real-time POLR charges)?


?         Losses - Can we utilize the imbalance markets to support losses?  Can we create specific loss standards that facilitate the scheduling process, or must we support methods that are currently in tariffs, but technically unwieldy?


?         Non-Jurisdictionals - How are non-jurisdictionals to be integrated into the new world?  Should systems be designed with the assumption that non-jurisdictional will be part of an RTO?  Or should they be designed to treat each NJE as a separate entity?


Hopefully, FERC will use this section as a template to answer these critical questions in an assertive manner, and give some solid direction in which to move. Kormos emphasized the need for concrete answers to these questions, pointing out that vague answers (i.e., ""do congestion management"") will take a year or two to resolve, but specific answers (i.e., ""LMP with financial hedging instruments"") will take only months.  The Commission asked Mike about moving forward, and he told them that effectively, it was impossible to move forward with implementation without getting these issues addressed.

Now for a  funny point - One of the commissioners (I think Breathitt) referred to some concerns expressed in the Northwest that their high concentration of hydro power makes LMP inefficient for the Northwest.  Kormos flat out said, ""My profession is understanding how power systems work, and I don't believe that that statement is true.""  He then backpedaled a bit and said that it would need more study, but he stood by his statement that the assertion by the Northwest interests was false.


NERC and GISB


A great deal of discussion focused around the need for a single standard-setting organization.  Massey went so far as to ask, ""Are we looking at a beauty contest between NERC and GISB?""  Cook and Boswell then went into several short polite jabs at each other's organizations.  Other participants continually reiterated the need for ONE, INDEPENDENT organization.  Interestingly, Boswell was very emphatic about the established trust and respect in GISB, while Cook preferred to only talk about the ""new"" structure of NERC and did not focus on its history.

Brownell offered some not-too-subtle passive support of GISB by pointedly asking both Cook and Boswell if they lobbied political positions (i.e., were they not only an organization but also a stakeholder?).  GISB was easily able to say they were not, but NERC of course had to admit to their romancing of Congress and the Bush administration for reliability legislation. Point, Brownell.

Mennes acted as somewhat of a supporter for NERC, playing Dave Cook's yes-man.  He probably did them a little bit of harm by pointing to NERC's supposed ""successes,"" such as TLR and E-Tag.  If staffers have tenure, they will likely remember that these ""successes"" have not been so successful, resulting in several filings and interventions.  We may also wish to file comments in specific objection to these claims, to refresh their memory and to show the pretty picture Marty painted was in fact a fiction.

There was a little discussion about splitting reliability and market issues, but general consensus was that I could not be done.  There was also some talk of folding NERC under GISB/EISB.

The arguments began winding down after a some time, and Boswell strongly urged the Commission to speak to industry executives and advocacy group leadership to see whether NERC or GISB should lead the industry forward.  NERC somewhat less enthusiastically supported this position.  In general, I would say it was a close fight but GISB came out more on top.

Let me know if you have any questions.

"industrial load locations","Gentlemen,
I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.  

Airproducts
Alcoa
BOC gases
Corrugated Services
Crown
Huntsman
Kinder Morgan
Koch
Praxair
TotalFina

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks, 
Clint

"ST LOUIE RAMS  VS  TAMPA BAY  AT  CLAUDIA'S  SIX PM KICK OFF","Go RAMS !

For all St Louis folks I'm looking to extend our 
Thanksgiving holiday one more night.  
I'd like to give thanks for St. Louis getting rid of 
Bill Bidwell and the Cardinals.  

I'd also like to give thanks to the RAMS for tonight's 
win!

I would invite people to our comfy abode but our TV SUX, 
so no NFL at the home.

This is terribly late notice, so RSVP via 318 2991 if 
you're headed to Claudia's and I'll meet you there.

I'm sure most of you got up on the mountain this 
weekend, so there wasn't a lot of football around.
I got in the better part of Sunday morning, and the 
conditions should just get better over the week.
Looks like Saturday is a definite, any takers for 
Meadows ?

Tis the season,

PK

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Third Quarter Earnings Results","
Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange
The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 12, No. 6, November 26, 2001

(Editor's Note - I'm sending this in four pieces today because it is a bigger
issue than usual due to the spring recruiting in basketball, track and
softball.)

Volume 12, No. 6, November 26, 2001

 Benson, Defense Stifle Ags; Huge Upsets Propel
Horns Into Big 12 Title Game Against Colorado

As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted, it was an old-fashioned,
rock-em, sock-em game in College Station before a state record football crowd
of 87,555 Friday, and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late
touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson.
After taking the 21-7 victory, head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team
on its fine 10-1 season and said he wasn't worried about the Bowl
Championship Series (BCS) ""because we'll be in it.""
I don't know if had a crystal ball, but immediately after the Longhorns'
expected victory, top-rated Nebraska was humiliated, 62-36, by Colorado, and
the next day No. 3 Oklahoma, a 27-point favorite lost at home to Oklahoma
State, 16-13. It was only the fifth time OSU has won at OU.
The good news is those games moved Texas up to the No. 3 spot in both major
polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the
first time since that 14-3 loss to OU back in October.
Texas plays Colorado Saturday at 7 p.m. in Irving's Texas Stadium for the Big
12 Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls, possibly
even the Rose Bowl in the national title game.
But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the
Longhorns out of the BCS mix.
Brown and his players are tickled orange, however, at the chance to play for
the conference championship.
""The BCS isn't an issue today,"" Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in
Norman. ""The Bowl game isn't an issue today.""
""We said we needed to get to the championship game,"" he said, ""but once you
get there, you need to win. After that, you just look up and try to figure
out where you are.""
""People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks,"" Brown said.
""Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end (of the season) and the
end's not even near where it should be.""
""People haven't given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five
weeks. To our kids' credit and to Colorado's kids credit, they kept working
hard and now they are in this game.""
The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the
Buffaloes, but we can enjoy it just a little longer.
This was a game where the defenses weren't going to give up a lot, but the
Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers
blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored.
The Aggies tied it on a 27-yard drive after a fine punt return in the third
quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind, which was around 15
miles per hour with frequent gusts to 25 or 30 miles per hour.
But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the
pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that
changed the field position for the rest of the game.
After a short Aggie punt midway through the period, the Longhorns rode
Benson's strong legs to a touchdown, then they got another from the powerful
freshman after Everick Rawls' interception in the final two minutes.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. After each defense got a quick stop, the
Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery
returned it 23 yards for a Longhorn TD and a 7-0 lead with 7:44 left. Another
three-and-out by the Aggies, followed by a shanked punt, gave Texas
possession at the UT 47. The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum
missed a 49-yard field goal try. Defenses dominated the quarter.  A&M led in
first downs, 3-2, and in total yardage, 40-25.
Second Quarter
A shanked punt by UT's Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn 47.
A&M couldn't move, but punted the ball dead at the UT 7. The Longhorn
offense, which had done little with the stiff wind, couldn't move into it,
and Bradford's 30-yard punt, a good one into the wind, gave A&M possessiion
at the UT 39. The Aggies made a first  down at the 26 before stalling. Cody
Scates missed a 43-yard field goal attempt. An interception of a long pass at
the UT 5 by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half
finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense, which drove to
midfield and killed all but 50 seconds of the half before stalling. Texas had
a 7-5 lead in first downs and a 92-60 lead in total offense at intermission.
Third Quarter
Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half. The Horns
couldn't move and punted. A&M's Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt
return, starting right, then racing left and going down the sideline for 37
yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT 27. The Aggies hit a pass
to the UT 8, then 220-pound RB Keith Joseph took over, powering to the left
to the 4, then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with
10:41 left. The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield, sparked
by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife. But, facing fourth down with an
inch or two needed, a lineman flinched and UT drew a 5-yard penalty and had
to punt.
Fourth Quarter
Benson, who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters, got 5 and
then 24 yards on his first two carries of the final period, getting the Horns
to the Aggie 45. But the UT offense stalled again and Bradford's punt was
killed at the Aggie 8. The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and
Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the A&M 40 and returned it
to the 35. Benson got loose for 12 to the 23, then got 5 and 2 to the 16. On
third and 3, Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle  to the A&M 5. Benson
powered through the right side for the TD on the next play. Mangum's kick put
UT on top, 14-7, with 7:22 left. Rawls interception at the A&M 27 and return
to the 12 with 1:59 left set up the final UT touchdown. Benson got 1, then
ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the
final 21-7 count.

Rose Bowl Road Full of Thorns

 If you still have some hope the Longhorns will be playing for the national
title in the Rose Bowl on January 3, here's what it would take:
1. A victory over Colorado Saturday.
2. A loss for either Florida or Miami and probably a loss for Oregon, too,
because the Ducks were ahead of Texas in the last BCS ratings. The Horns have
to be No. 1 or No. 2 in the final BCS ratings on December 9 to get to
Pasadena.
Miami plays at Virginia Tech Saturday, while Florida hosts Tennessee and
Oregon also is at home against Oregon State
If Florida beats Tennessee, the Gators would have to win the SEC title game
on December 8 against the winner of Saturday's game between Auburn and LSU.
Since that game is in Baton Rouge and Auburn's outstanding running back broke
his shoulder two weeks ago, LSU probably will be the Gators' Dec. 8 opponent.
It's asking a lot for two of those three teams to lose a game, but after the
games in Boulder and Norman last weekend, anything is possible.

Longhorn Notes

* Saturday's meeting between Texas and Colorado will be the sixth Big 12
Championship Game. Texas won the inaugural title game in 1996, Nebraska
triumphed in 1997 and 1999, Texas A&M won the title in 1998 and Oklahoma took
the crown in 2000. If Texas wins Saturday, the Longhorns will join Nebraska
as the only two-time champs.
* Since the Big 12 Championship Game counts in statistical manners, RB Cedric
Benson has a great chance to become the first Longhorn freshman to rush for
more than 1,000 yards in a season. He has 974 yards and ranks second among
Longhorn freshmen behind Ricky Williams, who rushed for 990 yards in 1995.
* Benson broke the UT freshman record for touchdowns with his pair of
fourth-quarter rushing scores. He has 12 touchdowns on the season  - 11
rushing and one on a shovel pass reception  -breaking the record of 10 set by
Roy Williams last year.
* Benson had only 12 yards on 14 carries after three quarters Friday in
College Station, but he finished strong, carrying 13 times for 67 yards and
scoring the Longhorns' only two offensive touchdowns in the final period. He
finished with 27 carries for 79 yards and two touchdowns.
* The UT defense is allowing 77.4 yards a game rushing, the fourth lowest
average in school history, trailing only teams from the old one-platoon days
when defense dominated and 7-0 games were the norm. The only lower season
averages were 57.5 in 1942, 65.9 in 1941 and 69.5 in 1943.
* This is Texas' first 10-win season since 1995, which was the last time
Texas won at Kyle Field. The Longhorns have had 15 teams with 10 or more wins
in a season, but this is just the third since 1983.
* Texas evened the series in College Station 21-21-2.UT leads the overall
series, 69-34-5
* The Texas defense has held its last eight opponents to less than 300 yards
of total offense. Texas A&M gained 165 yards, which was the fourth time Texas
has held its opponent to less than 200 yards in 2001.
* Sophomore WR B.J. Johnson extended his streak of consecutive games with a
catch to 23, a UT record to start a career and the third-longest in school
history. Mike Adams holds the school record of 26, which he set from 1995-96.
* Sophomore WR Roy Williams has caught a pass in 20 straight games. He had
eight receptions o move into sixth place on the UT career receptions list
(102). He also moved into second place on UT's single-season list with 62
receptions.
* Junior QB Chris Simms passed for 138 yards, giving him 2,473 yards on the
season and placing him second on the UT single-season chart. Major Applewhite
holds the UT record with 3,357 yards in 1999.
* Senior LB D.D. Lewis tied the UT record with his 49th straight start. He
now shares the record with Dan Neil (1993-96).
* Freshman WR Tony Jeffery scored his second career touchdown when he
returned Rod Babers' blocked punt 23 yards in the first quarter. His first
score came against Houston when he had a 17-yard touchdown reception. Texas
has returned two blocked punts for touchdowns in 2001 - the first was by
sophomore safety Phillip Geiggar against New Mexico State.
* Junior CB Rod Babers blocked a punt for the second straight game. It was
his second blocked kick of the season and the fifth for Texas as a team.
Texas has blocked seven kicks overall this season.
* Friday's victory marked UT's eighth straight road victory and 12th in its
last 14 games.
* Texas has produced seven defensive or special teams scores in 2001,
including four in the last three games.
* The Texas defense has had an interception in six straight games and eight
of 11 games this season.
* Texas is 28-1 when scoring first, 34-5 when leading at halftime and 33-0
when outrushing its opponent during the Mack Brown era. The Horns are 4-12
when they are outrushed during the Brown era.

Texas, the BCS and the Bowl Situation

Forget calculating the Longhorns' BCS standings and their chances of getting
into a BCS bowl.
It all got simplified when Nebraska and Oklahoma both lost last weekend.
Now, two improbable division winners - Texas in the South and Colorado in the
North - will meet Saturday for the Big 12 Championship and the automatic BCS
berth that goes with it.
It would take another big round of upsets for Texas to make it to the
National Championship Game in the Rose Bowl, but a second victory over the
Buffs Saturday would guarantee the Horns a BCS bowl bid.
It could be the Fiesta Bowl in Phoenix, which normally gets the Big 12
champion if the Big 12 champ isn't in the national title game.
But the BCS bowls can trade things around, and the Rose Bowl, normally the
meeting place for the Big 10 and Pac 10 champs, won't have a team from either
of those conferences in it unless Oregon gets lucky.
So, some Fiesta Bowl folks would like to turn their bowl into ""Rose Bowl II""
by inviting the Big 10 and Pac 10 champs.
They reportedly have been talking to the Sugar Bowl folks about switching
teams, and the New Orleans folks reportedly would love to have the Longhorns,
assuming they take care of business Saturday in Texas Stadium.
There also is an outside chance the Orange Bowl will get in on the swapping,
so the Horns could wind up there.
And what if Colorado pulls another big upset Saturday? Then we hope all of
you love the Cotton Bowl, because that is where Texas will be when the new
year begins.
The new BCS standings will be issued Monday, but, for the first time since
that all started, it really won't matter where Texas stands because a win
Saturday will guarantee a BCS bowl berth and a loss will guarantee there
won't be a BCS bowl berth for Texas.

Subject:	Holiday Party - Canceled


I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

All, 
In the future, please refrain from parking in the area on the west side of the building when working at or visiting the Austin Facility.  This area is reserved for General Motors.  It is easily identified.  The lot has blue striping and is marked ""GM Parking Only"". In most cases, there is ample parking in the front, rear and on the east side of the building.

you have already deduced, the biggest difference is that a person or a

Tyler DB Melton is 16th Commitment; DE Thornton Will Start Saturday

Tyler DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43, told me tonight he committed to Texas
earlier in the day ""because I knew I wanted to stay in state and, after
visiting A&M and Texas (unofficially), I just like Texas better.""
Melton, who has 40 tackles and two interceptions so far this year, said he
had offers ""from about 15 or 16 schools, including Texas, A&M, Purdue, TCU,
Baylor and West Virginia.""
Melton is the 16th recruit to commit to Texas. He is a member of my Fabulous
50.
The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are
listed on one or more national top 100 teams. They are  WR Marquis Johnson,
6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase
Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel; LB Garnett Smith, 6-3, 221,
4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of
San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, the
two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;  OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4,
310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of Allen;  and TE
David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship;  Davis made all of the
top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT  Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
DE Kalen Thornton, who missed the OSU game with a knee sprain, is practicing
again this week and defensive coordinator Carl Reese said he will start
Saturday, with Maurice Gordon moving back to DT. Reese also said sophomore
Adam Doiron, who started at tackle against OSU in Gordon's place, played well
against the Cowboys and will see a lot of action against Colorado.
He also said redshirt freshman Stevie Lee ""has had his best two days of
practice"" this week and also will play at DT. Lee is under 300 pounds now. He
reported at about 310 because he was recovering from a broken bone in his
foot that required surgery and wasn't able to run and work out as much as
usual.
DE O. J. McClintock, who has been out all year after suffering severe cuts to
his right arm and hand in a household accident before the season, also is
expected to play Saturday.
Reese said the Longhorn will need lot of defensive linemen to step up
Saturday because Colorado ""just lines up and tries to run over you play after
play.""
* * * *
The Longhorns' game at Missouri next Saturday will have a 2:30 p.m. kickoff
and UT officials say it will be available in Texas on pay-per-view TV, but
they said they are still working out the details. It was passed over for
regular TV programming, so pay-per-view is the only way fans who can't attend
will be able to see it.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES: DE Bryan Pickryl, 6-5, 230, 4.5, of Oklahoma powerhouse
Jenks, plans to come to the Texas-Colorado game this weekend. He said Texas,
Missouri and Oklahoma are his top three teams, but he also said he is
considering several other schools fairly seriously. His maternal grandmother
lives in Austin and he also has two uncles in the Austin area., so he has
spent some time in this area. Other top prospects who say they will be coming
to the Colorado game include RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park, OL Justin
Blalock of Plano East and LB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite . . DT Earl
Anderson of San Marcos says he is solidly committed to Texas and says he is
being misquoted by people who say he plans to take visits to other schools. .
. WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus was held out of last week's game
after missing school and reporting he was sick. FM coach Randy Mayes said he
isn't sure if Timmons will play this week. ""It depends on whether he misses
any more school or practices,"" he said. Timmons is a great football prospect,
and is by far the best WR in Texas, but he has had some disciplinary problems
and it seems they are continuing. But, as Mayes said, maybe he really was
sick.

Brown Says Buffs Pose Real Problem; No TV for Game at Missouri

Coach Mack Brown said  Monday Colorado will be the best running team Texas
will see this year and he also said the Buffaloes have the best offensive
line the Horns will face.
The two teams play at 2:30 p.m. Saturday in a game that will be televised
regionally by ABC. The Longhorns, 5-1, are a 10-point favorite over the
Buffaloes, also 5-1.
Brown said DE Kalen Thornton, who missed the Oklahoma State game with a
sprained knee, is expected to return to practice Tuesday and he said that is
very good news because Colorado has such a powerful running game that the
Longhorns will need every available defensive lineman to try to stop it.
""This is the best running team we have seen since the last time we played
Nebraska,"" he  said. ""They have a big, physical line, and some big, physical
backs.""
He said Oklahoma uses its passing game to set up its running game. He said
Colorado is the opposite. ""They run to set up their play-action passes,"" he
said. ""They have a very good offense, and their quarterback (Craig) Ochs is a
good passer and he can hurt you running. We'll have a battle.""
The Longhorns probably will be back in their basic 4-3 defense against the
run-oriented Buffs, and Brown said sophomore DT Adam Doiron, who started
against Oklahoma State, ""played really well"" and will start again. Fellow
sophomore Marcus Tubbs is a fixture at the other tackle spot.
If Thornton is able to return, Brown said that will give the coaches freedom
to use Maurice Gordon at end or tackle. Gordon, a former end, was a starting
tackle until Thornton got hurt, and then he moved back to end.
He said the Longhorns have to work hard to run a lot against Colorado's tough
run defense because ""they like to dominate time of possession with their
running game and just wear the other team down. We try to wear the other team
down, too, so that's going to be interesting.""
The Longhorns have won 11 straight games at home. That is the longest home
winning streak since the early 1980s. They also are 19-2 at home since Brown
took over.
Brown said true freshman RB Cedric Benson will start and Ivan Williams also
will play quite a bit against Colorado. ""Cedric did a good job,"" Brown said,
""and Ivan did  well when he came in late. We want Cedric to get a lot of
carries, but probably not 31 like he got against Oklahoma State. We'll
probably spread it out a little more.""
He also said TE Bo Scaife and Brock Edwards are going to start getting more
chances to catch passes. ""They can really run, and we've got to work them
into the offense a little more and give them more chances,"" he said.

The Longhorns 'game at Missouri on October 27 was not chosen for TV, but UT
officials have asked the Missouri athletic director to approve a pay TV
arrangement for some Texas cities. The game time would have to be 2:30 p.m.
or later to be approved for pay TV because the Big 12 has a rule that
prohibits any league game telecast conflicting with the sanctioned telecast,
which begins at 11 a.m. UT officials expect to get an answer from Missouri
officials Tuesday. This will be the first Longhorn game this season that was
not chosen for TV, and it is the longest road trip this season. Ironically,
the two longest Big 12 trips last year - to Colorado and Kansas - were not
chosen for TV either. So much for all that famed UT clout with the TV
networks.
* * * *
RECRUITING NOTES:  The Longhorns are still at 15 commitments. One of them is
a little shaky. LB Garnett Smith of Arlington Lamar says he plans to sign
with Texas, but might take a couple of visits. When kids take visits, the
commitments are shaky. We'll have to see what develops in regard to Smith and
his pledge to UT. . . Texas has pledges from five players on my 25-man
""diffefrence maker"" list, including No. 4 DT Earl Anderson of San Marcos, No.
11 LB Smith, No. 17 LB Brian Robison of Splendora, No. 23 OL Brett Valdez of
Brownwood and No. 24 QB Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar. The Horns have
a pretty good shot at every member of the top seven on that list - No. 1 DT
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, No. 2 QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison,
No. 3 DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, No. 5 DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands,
No. 6 RB Albert Hardy of Galena Park and No. 7 LB Aaron Harris of North
Mesquite. The won't get all of that group, but they might get most of them.

"New Course Offerings","Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the ""MBTI Work Styles""-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Gentlemen,
I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.

Kinder Morgan [Larry Jester]  W, Synder?

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks,

A group of girlfriends went on vacation and they see a five-story hotel with a sign that reads ""For Women Only"".  Since they were without their boyfriends, they decide to go in.  At the reception, a very attractive guy explains to them how it works.  ""We have 5 floors... Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are looking for, you can stay there.  It's easy to decide, since each floor has signs telling you what's inside.  But once you go past a floor, you cannot return."" 

So they start going up, and on the first floor, the sign reads:  ""All 
the men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive and kind.  The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the next floor. 

The sign on the second floor reads ""All the men here are wonderful 
lovers, but they generally treat women badly.""  This wasn't going to do, so the friends move up to the third floor where the sign reads, ""All the men here are great lovers and sensitive to the needs of women.""  This was good but there were still two more floors.  On to the fourth floor. 

The sign was PERFECT.  ""All the men here have perfect builds; are 
sensitive and attentive to women; are perfect lovers; they are also 
single, rich, and straight.""   The women seemed pleased but they decide that they would rather see what the fifth floor has to offer.. 

When they reach the fifth floor, the sign reads:  ""There are no men here.  This floor was built only to prove that it is impossible to please a woman""!                Keith (FXdog1@aol.com)

Enron, but apparantly they do not know that since I tried calling several 
times and they had no idea who the fuck I was talking about.  Man, Enron has 
had a tough time.  Amazing considering the talent that works at that 
company...not being sarcastic.  You should do the prudent thing and become a 
teacher/baseball coach like me...no stress, summers off, and job security.  
Plus, the pay is not as bad as it's made out to be...considering you get a 
pension when you retire.  I love it.  Anyway, I don't feel like typing

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

Back on track. Texas is now 6-1, and ranked #7 in both polls.  I
said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business,
things would shake out for them. It's sort of setting up that way,
isn't it? 2 weeks ago, Texas was #11, with 10 unbeatens in front
of them. In the last 12 days, half of those teams have lost. Of
the 6 now in front, 4 play each other in the next 3 weeks, and
the other 2 have VERY tricky games (#6 Florida vs. #19 Georgia,
#4 UCLA vs. #11 Oregon). The 'horns are right there in it.

41-7

Hello, shovel pass. Texas won a big game. Okay, not THE big game,
but A big game nonetheless. The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping
their chests about their rushing game and physical defense, and
left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact. Texas forced 4
turnovers, tying a season high (OSU), shutting down the Buffalo
ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of 425
yards total offense. On to the shovel pass.

Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass, because they
only did it a few times in the Spring. If you did see them try it
in the Spring, your heart was in your throat (like mine) when they
ran it on their own 5, because it was never what you would call a
""good play"" in practice. I think they tried it 4 times, and totaled
something like minus 9 yards and one interception. Nonetheless,
Simms sucked them in, Ced got the corner, and Roy sprung him to
mid-field. Two plays later (One being a fade to Roy that was maybe
Simms' best throw this year), touchdown. That was absolutely a
soul-stealing drive. If there is a team in college football better
at putting someone away right before the half than Texas, I haven't
seen them.

Missouri
1:00 pm
No T.V.

Well, the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for
you. The reason the pay-per-view didn't work is the way it was set
up. Texas residents would pay to see it, but it would be regionally
televised in Missouri. That sounds fair, right? Okay, now no one
gets to see it. Oh well, listen to the Texas game and watch OU play
Nebraska.

For those of you going to Missouri, it should be fun. Mizzou has
played pretty well in the last 3 weeks, but it's hard to get scared
of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME. Bowling Green? Are you
kidding me? Anyway, look (for those not going, listen) for Texas to
run, run, run this week. Missouri cannot stop the run (allowing 180
ypg), so Texas will exploit that. Last year Roy Williams ran loose
in the Tiger secondary, and Applewhite found him repeatedly
(7 catches, 87 yds). I see no reason for this to change, particularly
when Mizzou will have to put 8-9 on the line of scrimmage to stop
the run.

The tEXas tailgate will be at Spanky's Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn

______________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* D.D. Lewis recovered his 10th career fumble in the 1st half. He
now is the career leader for recovered fumbles, passing Tim Campbell
and Oscar Giles. To boot, he started his 45th consecutivegame, tying
him for 2nd career consecutive starts with Lance Gunn and Anthony
Curl (both 89-92).
* Texas forced 4 turnovers for the 2nd straight week. The Longhorn
turnover ratio is plus 7 so far this year.
* The defense is ranked #7 nationally, and #1 in the conference,
averaging a shade under 200 yards allowed a game. Look for these
numbers to be even better next week.
* Texas kicker Dusty Mangum is tied for 10th nationally and is #2
in the Big XII in scoring with 63 points.
* Missouri receiver Justin Gage is #2 in the Big XII with 45 catches
and 518 yards with 3 touchdowns. He will get locked up with Jammer
this weekend.
* The Tigers have found their passing game in Big XII play. The last
3 weeks, qb Kirk Farmer has thrown for 637 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In the 1st 3 games, 3 Missouri quarterbacks combined to throw for
only 399 yards and 3 t.d.'s. Must have been that stout Bowling Green
defense. Don't mess BG, or you, too, will face the Falcon wrath.
* Kicker Brad Hammerich is 8-9 on field goals, missing only from 50+
yards, and 53-54 on P.A.T.'s for his career. Hammerich connected on
the game winner at Oklahoma State in the 3rd overtime 2 weeks ago.
* Linebackers Jamonte Robinson and Sean Doyle might be the best
linebacking duo in the country. Doyle leads the Big XII with 77
tackles, and Robinson averages 14 tackles per game (he is 6th on
the all-time tackles list at Mizzou). Sean, Jamonte, this is
Cedric Benson.

______________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Will somebody get K-State a doctor? More like a mortician. The
Texas A&M Aggies went up to the Little Apple and snuck out with a
win. The Wildcats were stopped on the 5 on 4th and goal, and the
Aggies left with a 31-24 road victory. Nice job, Ags. Bye, bye,
Wildcats.
* Tech went to Lincoln and played well. The Red Raiders lost by
10, but played Nebraska even through 3 ? quarters. OU looked lack
luster in a 33-17 win over Baylor in Norman. You think these 2 were
peeking around the corner at each other?
* Game of the day: Lincoln, NE. Sooners vs. Bug Eaters. This should
be a good show.
*2nd best game of the day: Iowa St. at Texas A&M. The Aggies will
take care of business here...or will they? The Cyclones are 5-1,
only losing to Nebraska. Running back Ennis Haywood had 196 yds
rushing and 3 t.d.'s in the 28-14 win over OSU. Careful, Ags, or
we'll see you whining about this game on ""Sidelines"" next week.


Everyone have a good weekend. Hope to see you at Spanky's in Columbia.

	The Hilton Austin Airport has lowered the ERCOT parking rate and
ERCOT hotel room rate.  When you attend an ERCOT meeting at the
Hilton,
tell the parking attendant which meeting you attended and tell them
it
was with ERCOT and your parking will only be $3.

	In addition,  the Hilton Airport Hotel recently lowered our
ERCOT rate for a room.  Our rate went from $149 to $99 for an
executive
or deluxe room which includes one king bed (or 2 doubles), ironing
board, hairdryer, shaving mirror, 2 phones, internet high speed
access,
and a work desk.  The hotel is located right next to the Austin
Airport
and includes a restaurant.  Call 512-385-6767 to make reservations
with
the Hilton and be sure to mention ERCOT to get the preferred rate.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.

for my two weeks off.  I am going to S.A. for Thanksgiving (did I
already mention that?).  I am not sure if I want to fly with what

I hope you have a great time in Dallas and I'll chat with ya when I get

	   Hey there!  How was your Halloween party?  Did you dress up?
I hung out
	   with some friends, but no costumes.  Dexter Freebish - that's
it.  I'll
	   have to look for it up here.  We went to the APB party, but
left early
	   to get some food.  Things calmed down that last night
compared to
	   Tuesday.

	   I'll be back on days at the end of next week and then I'll
have two
	   weeks off.  I cannot wait!  What are your plans for
Thanksgiving?  I'm
	   flying to San Antonio to visit my dad for a few days.  I
can't decide
	   whether to stop over in Houston or just wait until Christmas.
I feel so
	   lucky that the shift I'm on has the holidays off.

	   I apologize for taking so long to respond to your message.  I
lost my
	   voice earlier this week which kind of makes it hard to trade.
Needless
	   to say, they sent me home to get better.  I secretly think
everyone was
	   happy not to hear me talk!  :o)  It was so strange because
other than
	   the loss of my voice, I felt fine.  Who knows?

	   Have a great week!  Hopefully we can talk when I get in the
office on
	   Thursday.

days
	   about 3
	      years ago.  So that probably means you have a three day
weekend,
	   and are
	      back on for days Monday.  That's just my guess.  As for
the band
	   I was
	      playing, I really don't remember which CD I had in there,
but it
	   was
	      probably Dexter Freebish or Vallejo.  They are both from
Austin.
	   You need
	      to call me when you get back on days.  I'm going to a
Halloween
	   party this
	      weekend at my manager's house.  It should be fun.  Are you

Subject: Lunch on Thursday

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter ""we"" or ""our"" or ""us"" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (""Lunch"") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (""Beer"") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve

Subject: Questions 3 & 5


All,
On last Wednesdays Change Control Conference Call, we had two questions
from the question sheet, Question #3 and Question #5, that were to be
answered by the MP's and sent to me for an aggragation of answers.  We
would then discuss
these answers on our next Conference Call.
I have compiled all of the responses I have received into this attached
spreadsheet.  Please notice that there are two tabs... so each question
has it's own sheet.  These responses will be discussed at the next
change control conference call.
Thank you to those who did respond and provided valuable feedback.

NOTE:  There will be NO Conference Call this week, 11/21/01.  I will not
be sending out Change Controls today.  Our next conference call will be
one week from Wednesday, 11/28/01 at 10:00 AM.

Glen incorporated the wrong bulletin into the guideline.  Not his fault, though.  George's website obviously had a problem and they recovered back to an old backup without knowing that they were affecting the validity of the bulletins.  I requested that someone initiate a change control to repair the examples, but I don't know who is working on this. 
  
The initial bulleting was revised a couple of times to include new revelations from RMS workshops and actual experience. 
  
Regards,

Subject: Change Control conference call 10/24 
Shirley, these questions came up on the change control conference call this morning and Texas Set members could not understand the disparity between the bulletin and transaction set.  Can you help us?   
Question: 
6) Question 2 is also related to bulletin A0056 attached. 
In the examples provided in the document the Service Period Start Dates in 
the BO and PM Loops do not match the Service Period Start Date in the PP 
Loop.  The 810_02 Service Period Start and Service Period End states: 
""Monthly Invoice:  Required - The full service period should match the 
applicable PTD loops from the 867."" 
A.  If the Service Period End Dates in the PP loop is different from the BO 
and PL Loops, what date should be used for the Service Period End Date on 
the 810_02? 
Question: 
7)  Question 3 is once again related to bulletin A0056. 
A.  Should the overlapping dates apply to the IA Loop as well, (i.e., since 
the IA Loop did not exist at the time the bulletin was created) or should 
they match the dates in the PP Loop?

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.

At RMS' October 11, 2001 meeting, Nancy Hetrick, RMS Chair, announced that an effort was underway to create an integrated planning calendar for the 1.4 Migration Plan and mass customer move from TDSPs to the Affiliated Retailer.  On October 16, 2001, RMS sponsored a workshop on the 1.4 Migration Plan.

Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange
The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 12, No. 3, October 29, 2001

 Simms Throws 4 TD Passes, Benson Rushes
For 157 Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers, 35-16

Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had career-best days
and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and
third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a 35-16 victory.
On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10,
and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care
of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12.
With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are
all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South.
But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference
game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game.
Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the
stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed
Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and
Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a pop.
But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going.
On their first drive, for example, they held the ball almost 10 minutes,
rolling 78 yards in 19 plays, but they got zero points because they stalled
at the Tiger 2 and Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.
They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession, but again
stalled.
Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first.
That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out
the Missouri defenders.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran
the UT kick back to the 38. The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out
and the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78
yards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty
Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal. Missouri went three-and-out again.
The Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended. Texas
had a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24
edge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but
the game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.
Second Quarter
The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter
and drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0
lead with 11:12 left. Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the
Longhorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up. Simms connected with WR B.
J. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms
to TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32. Mangum's kick tied it,
7-7, with 5:44 left. After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and
got a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard
gain to the MU 13. A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more
and a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock
Edwards for the final 3 yards and the TD. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7
lead with 1:50 left. The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two
minutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained
37 yards in three carries. His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the
Tigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw
two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut
the UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left. The Tigers outgained the Longhorns
in the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.
Third Quarter
Texas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time
it counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum
converted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left. the Longhorns overcame a
third-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin
for 24 yards. Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns
great field position at the MU 48. The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick
kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and
allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was
dominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.  The Tigers made
only one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs
on that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.
Fourth Quarter
The Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to
Abron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD. Missouri's pass
for a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.
Not to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4
before Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25
yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16
lead with 4:27 left.

Texas and the BCS

The next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different
from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot
higher than it was in the last one.
In the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked
No. 6 behind five teams with perfect records. The BCS standings are like golf
in that the lowest score is the best score.
Oklahoma came in at No. 1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by
Nebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas
at 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.
But a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.
Since OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should
pass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the
Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.
Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are
guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange,
Fiesta and Sugar.
The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year. Right now, that
looks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left
before making that date.
Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets,
like Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.
But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep
winning.

Key Games for BCS Watchers

If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape
in one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their
final three regular season games.
Assuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the
season:
This Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre
Dame and UCLA at Washington State.
The big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and
UCLA at Oregon.
On Nov. 17, Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma, Syracuse is at Miami, Michigan is at
Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia.
On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan hosts Ohio State, Nebraska goes to Colorado
and Oklahoma State plays at Oklahoma.
The big games on Dec. 1 are Miami at Virginia Tech, Tennessee at Florida and
Oregon State at at Oregon.
If Oklahoma loses to A&M, Tech or OSU and the Longhorns win out, Texas would
qualify for the Big 12 Championship Game on Dec. 8.
The final BCS rankings will be released on December 9, the day after the Big
12 and Southeastern Conference have their championship games.
Texas probably will be fourth or fifth in the BCS rankings to be released
today and the games mentioned above will be big determining factors in where
the Horns wind up.

Jackson, McClintock to Redshirt

It looks like senior LB Lee Jackson and junior DE O. J. McClintock will
redshirt.
Both have been out with injuries all season and head coach Mack Brown said
last week there are no plans to play them.
He said Jackson is still having troubles with his toe and his leg. He said
McClintock won't play unless the team suffers some injuries at DE.

Coach's Corner

The Longhorns, now ranked No. 5 in both polls after a rash of upsets
Saturday, are playing well, but they need to keep working to get better, head
coach Mack Brown said Sunday.
After studying films of the 35-16 victory over Missouri, Brown said he and
his assistants were generally pleased with the team's play.
But he said the defense will work on hard on tackling this week. ""We weren't
pleased with out tackling,"" Brown said. ""We weren't pleased one back gained
over 100 yards on us. We've got to get back to work on that.""
He also said the defense did a good job in permitting Missouri to get into
the red zone only three times all day ""but they scored all three times.
That's not what we want.""
The offense played a pretty good game, he said, adding that tackle Mike
Wiliams ""played great. He's our offensive player of the week.""
Defensively, he said the player of the week is CB Quentin Jammer, who held
the Tiger's nationally ranked WR Justin Gage to two receptions for 14 yards.
He was averaging 7.5 receptions per game and ranked second in the Big 12 in
that department.
Brown also said he is concerned about some aspects of the kicking game. ""We
kicked two balls out of bounds on kickoffs,"" he said. ""We've got some issues
there we've got to correct.""
He said backup LB Reed Boyd, who plays on several of the kicking teams, ""was
our special teams player of the week.""
Asked how he prepares his team for games like the next two, against Baylor
and Kansas, when the opponents are losing and struggling, he said, ""Baylor
played A&M and Oklahoma tough. Our guys need to play football because they
like playing it. If they can't get excited about playing football, they don't
need to be playing football at the University of Texas.""
He also said, ""Our guys need to understand that everyone wants to knock them
off.""

"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Subject:	results of football pool

Hello Everyone, 

	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks. In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people. Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game. 
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed. Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight. Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight. There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight. Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright. If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points. Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points. Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob. Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points. Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob. 

	We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2. We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!  There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday. Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

These are the questions and concerns provided by Connie and Trish.
To Dos:
* For consistency, Dave Odle will you please address the first
four items and provide the functionality difference for Version 1.3 and
1.4 as requested.  Please send this information ASAP to all three
listserves.
* Upon receipt of the above information, each company should
address from their perspective, the questions posed in the second
paragraph.
* Each company (TDSP, CR, ERCOT) should then address from your
companies' perspective each of the questions regarding the various
Options.
* Shirley Whyte - as ITPTA would you please provide to all three
listserves ASAP an explanation of what funcitonality is tested in Frame
6, so that companies may specially answer question #7.
* Please evaluate the various options provided in the previous
email and document from your companies perspective:  known or peceived
risks, any ideas on how to mitigate these risks, what contingency plans
do we need in place, etc.

I wanted to get these items to you as soon as possible so you may begin
to evaluate,etc.  Since we have extremely tight timeframe for companies
to gather this information and rather than forward all of this
information to me to somehow combine.  By noon, Tuesday, October 30th,
please provide from your companies perspective (TDSP, CR, and ERCOT) for
each option:  pros, risks associated with each option, any ways to
mitigate these risks, impacts to the market/customers, and what would be
the contingency plan.  Discussion around these items will also help us
to answer the other questions posed, but please come to the meeting
prepared with your companies response to all of the questions.

I realize that this may not make sense on Monday morning (since it is
1:15 Saturday morning), so please feel free to let me know if you have
any questions, etc.  Thanks.

"RE:","I'm sorry to hear that your daughter is more important than UT football (just kidding).  Anyway, we will have to wait til next year, I guess.  I'm definitely looking forward to this weekend.  I'm not sure when I'm coming into town, but I might stop by before the game.  I'll let you know beforehand.  The weather for Sunday is supposed to be up around 80.

November 10th is Tori's birthday party.  No way I could make the game.  We'll have family in from out of town to entertain.  
Oh, how the weekends fill up.  I'm glad to hear that you'll be hanging out with us Saturday night and Sunday.  If the weather cooperates, we'll try to get the boat out.
See you Sat. night.  Tell your brother that I said Hello and that we need to go get a cheesesteak at Texadelphia.

Unfortunately, no.  We have friends coming in town-Scott and Mandy from 
Dallas.  We thought the 4 of us were going to be able to go to the game. 
However, Scott's hookup for tickets fell through.  Therefore, we will be 
watching it at my house.  It would probably be rude of me to go with you 
and leave them there.  You should come over after the game.  And, you are 
welcome to stay with us Saturday night.  We need to catch up.  We may go 
out on the boat Sunday if the weather is nice. 
Let me know.

Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange Newsletter
The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful

Volume 12, No. 2, October 22, 2001

 Longhorn Defense Stifles Buffs; Simms, Benson Spark Offensive Fireworks in
41-7 Romp

The Texas defense forced four turnovers and totoally shut down Colorado's
offense in the second half to lead the No. 9 Longhorns to a 41-7 victory over
No. 14 Colorado in Austin.
The offense also had a great day, with QB Chris Simms throwing for 234 yards
and three touchdowns and true freshman RB Cedric Benson getting 100 yards for
the second straight Saturday. He also scored two touchdowns and caught three
passes for 59 yards.
Benson had the day's biggest offensive play. It came with the Longhorns
leading 17-7 and facing second-and-20 at their own 5 just before the the
half. The Horns were going into a stout wind and Colorado was threatening to
get the ball back in great field position.
But Simms dropped back and, just before he was hit, flipped a shovel pass to
Benson, who caught it, put an awesome move on two Buff defenders and sped 40
yards to launch the Longhorns on an 85-yard scoring drive that broke the game
open.
The UT defense forced four Buffalo turnovers - three fumbles and a pass
interception - and held the potent Colorado offense to just two first downs
and 45 net offensive yards in the second half.
The three fumbles Colorado lost all came in the first half and cost the Buffs
a first-and-goal at the UT 4 with Texas ahead only 7-0, and set up short
Longhorn scoring drives for the field goal that made it 10-0 and the
touchdown that gave Texas a 17-7 lead.
Colorado's starting QB, Craig Ochs, did not play because of a concussion he
suffered in the victory over Texas A&M last week. His replacement, Bobby
Pesavento, is a better passer, but Ochs is a much better runner and his
absence caused the Buffaloes to change their offensive strategy to include
more passing and less double tight end power running. The Longhorn defense
also had something to do with that.
Here, briefly, is how the game went
First Quarter
Texas won the toss and deferred. Colorado took the ball and the Longhorn
defense stuffed the Buffs' power running game and forced a quick punt.
Starting at their own 40 after a short punt into the stiff wind, the Horns
scored quickly. Benson ran for 5, then Simms hit TE Bo Scaife for 7. A wide
receiver reverse was beautifully blocked, allowing B. J. Johnson to gallop 35
yards to the Buffalo 13. Benson carried three times for a first down at the
3, then Simms, after a fake to Benson going right, rolled left and hit WR Roy
Williams for the TD. Dusty Mangum's kick gave UT a 7-0 lead with 9:09 left.
On the first play after the kickoff Pesavento hit two big passes to the UT
21. Then he threw into a crowd at the Longhorn 10, but WR Derek McCoy
wrestled it away from three Horns and bulled to the four before fumbling.
Freshman LB Derrick Johnson recovered for Texas. The Horns couldn't move and
a short punt gave the Buffs the ball at their own 48. Colorado went to its
power running game and rolled to a first down at the UT 15 before the
Longhorn defense stiffened and forced a 29-yard field goal try that was wide.
CU led in first downs, 6-4, and in total offense, 126-82, but the Longhorns
led, 7-0, because they scored on their only foray deep into Buff territory,
while the Buffaloes'  fumble at the 4 and missed chip-shot FG killed both
their scoring chances.
Second Quarter
DE Kalen Thornton forced a fumble that was recovered by UT CB Roderick Babers
at the CU 21. The Horns drove to the 4 before Mangum kicked a 21-yard field
goal for a 10-0 lead with 11:47 left. UT's kickoff into the wind went out of
bounds, giving Colorado good field position at the 35 and the Buffs got their
running game going and swept in for the TD in just seven plays to cut the
lead to 10-7 with 8:32 left. UT drove into Buff territory, but Simms was
sacked to kill the threat. The third Colorado fumble of the half set the
Horns up at the Buff 35 and they capitalized, but they they had to score two
TDs to get credit for one. First, Simms hit Williams in the end zone and
Williams got a foot down in bounds, but the official waved it off. Benson got
the TD on a 12-yard run and Mangum's kick gave UT a 17-7 lead with 3:22 left.
A quick defensive stop gave the Horns another possession at their 15 with
2:08 left. Simms was sacked at the 5 on the first play, but Benson took a
shovel pass, juked two defenders off their feet at about the 10 and scampered
40 yards down the sideline. Simms passed to WR B. J. Johnson for 22 and to
Williams for 29 before Benson scored from the 4 with 1:10 left for a 24-7
lead. Texas led in first downs, 8-4, and in total offense, 144-118 in the
quarter.
Third Quarter
Texas couldn't move into the wind and had to punt. Colorado drove to the
Texas 32 and went for it on a fourth-and-2, but the Longhorn defense held
Brown to a 1-yard gain to end that drive. The Longhorn offense then drove 69
yards in 7 plays for another TD, with the payoff coming on a 24-yard pass
from Simms to WR Sloan Thomas. Mangum's kick gave Texas a 31-7 lead with 6:47
left. The UT defense stifled Colorado's next effort and Nathan Vasher ran the
Buffalo punt back 44 yards to the CU 18, setting up a 34-yard Mangum FG for a
34-7 lead with 3:53 left. Texas led in first downs, 7-2, and in total
offense, 101-35, in the quarter.
Fourth Quarter
Simms found Thomas all alone in the end zone  for 29 yards and the game's f
inal score on the Horns' first possession in the quarter. Major Applewhite
and Chance Mock took over at QB after that. The Longhorn defense did not
allow Colorado a single first down in the period and the Buffs had only 10
plays for 10 net yards.

older to call.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday studying the films of the Longhorns 41-7 victory
over Colorado Saturday ""proved what we felt all along - our guys played
really well and really hard all day.""
He also said Colorado ""is a much better team than yesterday's score would
indicate. That was just a game that got out of hand because of turnovers.""
He said he was very pleased with the shovel passes, wide receiver reverses
and other misdirection plays the Horns used very successfully Saturday.
""If you are moving the ball, they usually work,"" he said. ""We've talked about
needing a little more misdirection. All of them are things we need to run
because it makes our regular plays work better.""
He had said last week wanted to ""use more traps, run more gaps and counter
gaps,"" saying it slowed defensive pursuit and created more doubt in the minds
of defenders.
After using a lot of them against the Buffaloes, he said they will remain a
part of the UT offense.
Colorado came into the game on a five-game winning streak and with a powerful
running game that ranked No. 13 nationally at 224.7 yards a game and a strong
rushing defense that was No. 15 nationally, allowing only 91.8 yards.
That had allowed the Buffs to dominate time of possession against their foes.
They were averaging about 36 minutes a game, compared to about 24 minutes for
their opponents.
But Texas dominated the time of possession, 33:33 to 26:27, held the
Buffaloes to 124 net rushing yards, 100 yards below their average, and rushed
on the Buff defenders for 161 yards, about 70 more than they had been
allowing.
Brown said the Longhorn defense did an outstanding job against the CU power
runners, and he said the Texas' offense was successful because it was able to
""stay two dimensional.""
But he said the early UT lead, helped along by the Colorado turnovers,
""forced them to try to play catch-up, and playing catch-up is not their game.""
""I think Colorado is really good,"" he said. ""We've played so well at home,
and our crowd gives us a big advantage at home. I think Colorado will win a
bunch more football games this year.""
Longhorn true freshman RB Cedric Benson picked up 100 yards rushing on 23
carries and scored two touchdowns in his second start.
It marked the first time all season a running back has hit the Colorado
defense for 100 yards.
""That's a credit to our balance, our offensive line and to Cedric,"" Brown
said. ""He's a fine running back who has great vision and who almost always
falls forward. He's getting better every week.""
Brown said he and his assistant coaches talk constantly to their players
about the need to show up ready to play every week, and he also said it's way
too early to worry about the BCS bowl situation ""because there are a lot of
football games still to be played before that comes into play.""
""We talked to our team after Florida lost to Auburn about how you can't
control anything except what you do. Anybody can beat anybody.""{
""Our guys understand the only thing they can do is be the best football team
they can be and be ready to play Missouri this Saturday. What we've got to do
is try to win four more football games and see where that takes us.""

Longhorn Notes, Quotes . .
They say football is a game of inches and UT QB Chris Simms will buy into
that, particularly after executiing the shovel pass to freshman RB Cedric
Benson just before the half that went for 40 yards and helped break the game
open.
""I was nervous dropping back,"" Simms said. ""I was in the end zone and saw the
defensive  end coming, and I didn't know if our tackle got a good piece of
him, and I'm thinking, 'Gosh, I have to get it out.' Cedric's still turning
around, and I kind of threw it just as I was about to get hit and hoped he
could catch it.""
""Cedric just got turned around and he caught it and then made an unbelievable
move down the sideline.""
As for Benson, he says college football is a little more complicated than he
thought it would be.
""In high school, it was basically run left, run right,"" he said. ""Here, I'm
learning how to block, how to fake better and how to run better routes.""
Simms said Benson ""is going to be great. He runs so hard on every play, and
the thing I like about him is every time I drop back to pass and he protects
for me, he turns around after his block and goes, 'Did I do okay?' ""
""I say, 'I didn't get hit, did I?' You did okay.""

Dear Longhorns,

One more tip to try to make it easier to get tickets for Saturday's game.


First, go to:

www.ebay.com

Then click on Search and enter ""UT tickets"" or ""Big 12 tickets"" and make sure
you click the box ""Search Description"". One guy who has been there says that
will get you a bunch of them.

"EnronOnline- Change to Autohedge","Effective Monday, October 22, 2001 the following changes will be made to the Autohedge functionality on EnronOnline.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Please see example below:

Parent's Settings:
Minimum: 	5000
Increment:  1000

Volume on Autohedge transaction			Volume Hedged
1      - 2499							0
2500 - 5499							5000
5500 - 6499							6000

At this point I do not have any significant new information about our company status, but I will relay the latest information that I have.  I know there are many rumors swirling around right now.  I will try to answer any questions that people have.  It would be helpful if people would submit questions in advance.  Although this is not a requirement for asking questions, it would be helpful if you would email questions/rumors to Julie Kearney before the meeting.

Please let me or Debra know if you have any questions.

Let me talk to the Germans and see what they say.  I'll see if they are willing to shell out any DM's for your services.  Did you think of taking a part-time job while you are there to subsidze yourself?  Most if not all the Germans will be working for there is not too much money there for salaries.
If you send me a copy of your resume I can send it to them and perhaps they could find something suitable.  Having an EU passport is a HUGE advantage.  Speaking German would be also......

There will be no 3 Allen Center network access during the electrical maintenance and the outage will continue until ENS is able to power up all of the networking devices.  
All 3AC and 2AC employees will have no telephone or voicemail service during outage period. When power is restored to building, systems will be powered back up and telco services tested for dial tone and connectivity.
If you need access to 3AC anytime that Saturday, you will need to contact Trizechan Properties beforehand with your security information (Jael Olson at 713-336-2300).  Anyone who attempts to enter the building on Saturday that is not on the list will be denied access.

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the ""Personal Data"" option off the main log-in screen.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Recruiting Roundup

Today (Monday) was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big
recruiting push by going to top recruits' schools and homes, but the big game
Saturday has pushed that back a week.
But don't worry about it. Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and
his previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have
been great.
This year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants
have signed. There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better
than the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class.
They already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have
been on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked
as one of the top five in the nation.
Let's take a look at where they are and where they are going:
OFFENSE
Quarterback
UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot
better than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot
at Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game
Friday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even
running an interception back for a touchdown. (Yes, he plays defense, too,
when needed.)
Running Back
The Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten Smithson Valley and
are in the hunt for power-runner deluxe Albert Hardy of Galena Park and
elusive Selvin Young of Jersey Village. They have an outside shot at Lorenzo
Booker of Ventura, Cal., the nation's highest rated running back.
Tight End
David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship, a national top 100 player on some lists,
is already committed. He is very good. The only other TE the Horns are
recruiting is Eric Winston, the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at
Midland Lee.
Wide Receiver
National top 100 star Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and Dustin Miksch
of Round Rock Westwood are already committed. Robert Timmons of Flower Mound
Marcus, a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because
of transfer problems, is a possibility, and, if the Horns don't get him, they
might wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein
Forest.
Line
The Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen, a great pass
blocker who is on several national top 100 lists, and from Brett Valdez of
Brownwood, a tremendous run blocker.
They are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of
Spring Westfield. Blalock is the best run blocker I've seen this year.
DEFENSE
End
Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, a national top 100 player, has committed
and will enroll in January and go through spring training, which will give
him a chance to see action as a true freshman. The Longhorns are in the hunt
for Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., a speed rusher deluxe, Larry Dibbles of
Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands. All three are on every national
top 100 list I've seen.
Tackle
Texas has commitments from four top tackles - Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast
Community College, a JC in Mississippi, Earl Anderson of San Marcos, Lyle
Sendlein of Scottsdale Chapaparral and Tully Jantzen of Keller. Davis has
some academic issues. Sendlein also is a very good offensive lineman and
Jantzen is swift enough to play end. Texas has a very good shot at Rodrique Wr
ight of Alief Hastings, the nation's top DT, and at Marco Martin of Mesquite,
another national top 100 player. Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo, who
excels at DT and OG, also is a strong possibility. It's 50-50 on whether he
will play offense or defense in college. He is the son of David Studdard, a
former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos.
Linebacker
Texas starts three seniors and needs a great group. Garnet Smith of Arlington
Lamar, Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are
already committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from
Texas and across the country. A. J. Nicholson of Winston Salem, N. C., and
Aaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top 100 middle backers who are
strongly considering Texas, and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus
Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life, are fast outside backers the Horns
are recruiting. Another possibility is Lance Mitchell a top JC linebacker in
California who ir orignally from Dallas. He is considering taking a visit.
Defensive Backs
Matt Melton, a hard-hitting safety from Tyler, is already committed. Swift
Edorian McCullough of North Garland, the Class 5A 100 meter champ, also is
considering Texas, along with Brodney Pool, a big, fast safety from Houston
Westbury.
Kicker
Texas is looking for a kicker, but has not homed in on one yet. The coaches
want someone who can kick off into the end zone consistently.

Longhorn Basketball Adds Pair

Twotop basketball recruits have signed with Texas, head coach Rick Barnes has
announced.
Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound forward from Austin Westlake, and Kenton
Paulino, 6-2, 165, a com bo guard from  Los Angeles Fremond HS who will play
for Maine Central Institute this season, are the new signees.
""Signing Brad and Kenton is another sign that our program is really on the
rise,"" Barnes said.  ""Both have great athleticism and an attitude of winning
about them that we need to continue to bring to The University of Texas.""
Buckman plays for coach Clifton McNeely is at Westlake and is a national top
30 recruit.
The No. 2 high school prospect in  Texas according to Mike Kunstadt's Texas
Hoops, Buckman averaged 19.8 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 blocks per game
during his junior season.
He also is tabbed the No. 15 prospect in the nation by Clark Francis' Hoop
Scoop.  Buckman earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the prestigious
Pitt3 Five-Star Camp this July in Pittsburgh, Pa.
""There's not a program in the nation that did not go after Brad during the
recruiting period, so to come out on top in that battle is a huge win for
us,"" Barnes said.
""Brad turned down four of the most storied programs in college basketball
history for the opportunity to play at Texas."" Barnes said.
""He made one of the biggest jumps in his game that I have seen during the
summer camp period.
Brad has a tremendous competitive fire and is one of those players that fans
here will really appreciate.""
Paulino plays under coach Carl Hendrickson at Maine Central.  He starred at
Fremont High School under coach Sam Sullivan, where he averaged 24 points a
game and earned Los Angeles Co-Player of the Year accolades during his senior
campaign.
""Kenton is one of those explosive scoring guards that we need in our
program,"" Barnes said.
""He is a very good shooter with range and an exceptional athlete who
high-jumped 6-10 in high school. Kenton is the complete guard we were looking
for.""

Horns Sign 2 in Softball

Texas softball coach Connie Clark has signed centerfielder Tina Boutelle of
Katy Taylor and second baseman Chezare Sievers of Aliso Niguel HS in Mission
Viejo, Calif.
""We are excited about signing two of the top recruits in the country,"" Clark
said. ""Tina and Chezare will be immediate impact players for us. We only lose
two players to graduation in the spring of 2002 and are pleased to have Tina
and Chezare as our newest additions to the softball program.""
Boutelle, a 5-5 left-handed hitter, was named first team All-American as a
junior while helping her team to a 31-4 record and a second-place finish at
the Texas 5A State Championship.
She also is an All-District and All-Greater Houston selection. She was named
to the Texas Girls Coaches Association All-State Team and first team Academic
All-District in 2000.
Boutelle helped the Katy Cruisers club team to its second consecutive ASA
Gold National Championship in 2001, playing with UT freshmen pitcher Cat Os
terman and third baseman/shortstop Tiffany Anders. With her addition, the
Longhorns will have five players on the roster that have played for the Katy
Cruisers.
""Tina is definitely a long-ball threat,"" Clark said. ""She has tremendously
quick hands and extremely good foot speed. Tina also is the type of player to
make things happen because she plays with a lot of passion and enthusiasm.""
Sievers  finished her 2001 season with a .427 batting average and 19 RBIs.
She was named first team All-League and second team All-County as a junior.
The 5-0 infielder also was named first team All-California Interscholastic
Federation (CIF) as a sophomore. She is a member of the California Cruisers
club team, which placed second at the 2001 ASA Gold National Championships to
the Katy Cruisers.
""Chez can cover a lot of ground,"" Clark said. ""She is an extra-base type of
hitter who also has the ability to play the short game. Chez also has
tremendously quick hands and I think fans will be excited to watch her play.""

Longhorn Women Start Fast

Sophomore center-forward Stacy Stephens led the Longhorn women's basketball
team to the championship of the Paradise Jam Tournament in St. Thomas last
weekend.
Stephens was named the tourney MVP after leading Texas past Southern
California, 66-64, in the championship game. She had 16 points and six of
them came in the final two minutes.
Freshman Heather Schreiber was named to the All-Tournament Team after scoring
13 points, and another freshman forward, Kala Bowers, had 10 points.
Stephens and senior point guard Kenya Larkin had led Texas to a 75-70 upset
win over No. 23 Wisconsin in the semifinals game Saturday.
Stephens had 17 points and 13 rebounds against the Badgers and Larkin added
14 points and six assists. She also made four free throws in the final two
minutes.
The Longhorns are off to a 3-0 start and host No. 19 LSU Thursday night.

Texas Men 4th in Tourney

The Longhorn men lost to No. 20 Indiana, 77-71, Saturday in the third-place
game in the Great Alaska Shootout Tournament in Anchorage.
Freshman point guard T. J. Ford led Texas with 16 points and eight assists.
Senior forward Chris Owens, held scoreless in the first half, got 14 after i
ntermission.

points for the Longhorns.

"FW: PUC Concerns with V. 1.4 Cutover","These are the questions and concerns provided by Connie and Trish.
To Dos:
*	For consistency, Dave Odle will you please address the first
four items and provide the functionality difference for Version 1.3 and
1.4 as requested.  Please send this information ASAP to all three
listserves.
*	Upon receipt of the above information, each company should
address from their perspective, the questions posed in the second
paragraph.
*	Each company (TDSP, CR, ERCOT) should then address from your
companies' perspective each of the questions regarding the various
Options.
*	Shirley Whyte - as ITPTA would you please provide to all three
listserves ASAP an explanation of what funcitonality is tested in Frame
6, so that companies may specially answer question #7.
*	Please evaluate the various options provided in the previous
email and document from your companies perspective:  known or peceived
risks, any ideas on how to mitigate these risks, what contingency plans
do we need in place, etc.

I wanted to get these items to you as soon as possible so you may begin
to evaluate,etc.  Since we have extremely tight timeframe for companies
to gather this information and rather than forward all of this
information to me to somehow combine.  By noon, Tuesday, October 30th,
please provide from your companies perspective (TDSP, CR, and ERCOT) for
each option:  pros, risks associated with each option, any ways to
mitigate these risks, impacts to the market/customers, and what would be
the contingency plan.  Discussion around these items will also help us
to answer the other questions posed, but please come to the meeting
prepared with your companies response to all of the questions.

I realize that this may not make sense on Monday morning (since it is
1:15 Saturday morning), so please feel free to let me know if you have
any questions, etc.  Thanks.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Yoder, Christian  
Sent:	Tuesday, December 18, 2001 5:12 PM
To:	DL-Portland World Trade Center
Subject:	Lunch on Thursday

Friends and Co-Workers:

You are hereby cordially invited to a pre-holiday office lunch this Thursday at approximately 11:30 a.m, courtesy of the Trading Attorneys.

LEGAL NOTICE:  Christian Yoder and Steve Hall (hereinafter ""we"" or ""our"" or ""us"" ) intend to pay for the food (which will probably, but not necessarily, be pizza and salad) with post-petition Chapter 11 salary dollars that have already cleared our respective individual bank accounts and, therefore, by joining us in the meal (""Lunch"") you will not be exposed to any retroactive claw-back risk by way of the Cash Account Committee.  We are also investigating the possibility of providing a limited quantity of a certain kind of beverage (""Beer"") under a provisional waiver of the defunct pre-petition Company's drinking policies, subject to approval by the Estate's Liquor Control Board which is being sought on an expedited basis.       

We feel like making this modest holiday gesture for several reasons: 

1.  It has been a pleasure working with you all during the past year.
2.  We are optimistic about this office's prospects in the upcoming year.
3.  American Express forgot to cancel our Corporate Cards.

We hope you will join us for a free lunch as we look forward to a prosperous New Year.

Christian and Steve

"PLEASE READ - IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENRON SAVINGS PLAN","Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Recruiting Roundup
Tyler DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43, committed to Texas last week  ""because
I knew I wanted to stay in state and, after visiting A&M and Texas
(unofficially), I just like Texas better.""
He said he visited UT unofficially because he wants to take his official
visit the December 14 weekend to attend the Longhorn football banquet.
Melton, who has 40 tackles and two interceptions so far this year, said he
had offers ""from about 15 or 16 schools, including Texas, A&M, Purdue, TCU,
Baylor and West Virginia.""
He is the 16th recruit to commit to Texas. He is a member of my Fabulous 50.
The other recruits who have committed to Texas include nine recruits who are
listed on one or more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
Michael Williams, the big and fast linebacker from Lindale I wrote about it
my last issue, went to the Oklahoma-Baylor game Saturday and committed to the
Sooners.
When I talked to him Sunday night, he called it ""a soft commitment,"" and
said, ""I'm still going to visit Texas on December 14 and I might visit
Minnesota and Texas Tech, too.""
I think he's in about the same boat as Garnet Smith, the Arlington Lamar
linebacker who is committed to Texas.
Both say they are committed, but both want to look around a little bit to see
if they find anything better.
I always compare it to being engaged and dating other people, which makes
getting married somewhat iffy.
Williams probably will wind up at OU and Smith probably will wind up at
Texas, but both cases will bear watching right up to and through signing day
in February.

Several top national recruits were in Austin for the Texas-Colorado game,
including DE Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Oklahoma, who was there on his official
visit.
He wasn't expected back at home until Monday, so I wasn't able to talk to him
after his visit, but before his visit he told me he has narrowed his choices
to Oklahoma, Texas and Missouri.
Top Texas players who were at the game included RB Albert Hardy of Galena
Park, MLB Aaron Harris of North Mesquite, DE Travis Leitko of The Woodlands
and WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus.
Players already committed to UT who were there included Smith, Anderson,
Thomas, Janszen, Myers and Miksch.
This Longhorn recruiting class is already ranked No. 5 in the country by a
couple of national recruiting services.
The ranking will improve dramatically if the Horns hold what they have and
add a few top national recruits like DT Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, QB
Vincent Young of Houston Madison, DE Larry Dibbles of Lancaster, and some of
the players who attended the game Saturday, like Pickryl, Hardy, Harris,
Leitko and Timmons.
The Horns won't get all of those guys, but they
(continued on page 6)

Recruiting . . (continued from page 3)
will get several of them and their chances are very good with Wright,
Dibbles, Harris, Hardy and Timmons, if he walks the straight and narrow path
for the rest of the season.
They also are close to 50-50 with Pickryl, Young, and Leitko.
If Williams does follow through on his plans to visit Texas the Dec. 14
weekend, his pledge to OU might turn out to be really soft.
Of course, the same could be said of Smith's commitment to Texas, if he
follows through on his announced plans to take other visits.
* * * *
Texas has pledges from five players on my 25-man ""difference maker"" list,
including No. 4 DT Anderson, No. 11 LB Smith, No. 17 LB Brian Robison of
Splendora, No. 23 OL Brett Valdez of Brownwood and No. 24 QB Billy Don Malone
of Paris North Lamar.
The Horns have a pretty good shot at everyone in the top seven on that list -
No. 1 DT  Wright, No. 2 QB Young, No. 3 DE Dibbles, No. 5 DE Leitko, No. 6 RB
Hardy and No. 7 LB Harris .
They won't get all of that group, but they might get most of them.
* * * *
I think the Longhorns will sign at least four  players from the eight-member
group of superstars that includes Wright, Dibbles, Harris, Hardy, Pickryl,
Young, Lietko and Timmons.
If they do, this class will rank very high nationally, probably in the top 3.
That would give the Longhorns four straight super classes heading into next
season and, for the first time, the oldest group of that foursome would be
seniors or juniors who have redshirted.
* * * *
The Longhorns, with 16 commitments already, have a couple of shaky ones in
Smith, who plans to take other visits, and one player who has an uphill
battle to qualify.
They can take more than the normal 25 limit in a single year because Pittman
plans to graduate from Shreveport Evangel in December and enroll at Texas in
January, which will let him count against last year's total.
Pickryl also plans to graduate early, so he also could be counted back to
last year if he signs with Texas.
I expect the Longhorns to take commitments from another 10 to 12 recruits.
The number will be on the low side if Smith stays solid and Pickryl goes
alsewhere, but it will rise if Smith strays and Pickryl comes aboard.
* * * *
Sonny Davis suffered a torn ACL in a recent game at Gulf Coast JC in
Mississippi and is due to undergo knee surgery this week.
His mother told me he still hopes to graduate early and enroll at Texas in
January. The surgery probably would knock him out of most or all of the
contact work, but should allow him to be fully recovered by the start of next
season.

Game Quotes . .
""We played poorly. We turned the ball over and could not overcome the
adversity we created for ourselves. I give Texas a lot of credit. They have
good players who are well coached. I feel bad that we didn't give them a
better game.""
- Colorado head coach Gary Barnett
* * * *
""We did not want to be one dimensional. We knew it wouldn't be easy to run on
Colorado, but we knew we had to keep at it. I thought the offensive line did
a good job and Cedric (Benson) did a great job.""
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""We worked all week against two tight ends and I think in this game they ran
two tight ends maybe four times. They did a great job of coming and doing
exactly what we weren't planning on. But our guys did a pretty good job of
improvising.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""We forced some turnovers today, and when you got most of the turnovers, you
usually win the game.""
- UT linebacker De'Andre Lewis
* * * *
""Sloan Thomas is probably the most underrated wide receiver in the country.""
- Longhorn QB Chris Simms, talking about the backup wide receiver who has
scored two touchdowns in each of the last two games
* * * *
""We did self destruct a little bit, but I don't want to take anything away
from Texas. They came out ready to play on both sides of the ball, as well as
on special teams. We made a lot of mistakes today and they had us on our
heels throughout the second half.""
- Colorado linebacker Joey Johnson
* * * *
""He's an unbelievable running back. He runs hard and that move he put on to
break that long gain on the shovel pass at the end of the first half was
unbelievable.""
- Simms, talking about Longhorn freshman running back Cedric Benson
* * * *
""They beat us in every phase of the game. I don't think it was one particular
thing. We had some turnovers and they put together some long drives. They
also did a nice job in the punt return game.""
- Buff linebacker Robbie Robinson
* * * *
""We can't keep our defense on the field that long. We let the defense down.
We self-destructed and Texas took advantage of everything.""
- Colorado running back Cortlen Johnson
* * * *
""We not only won, but we dominated, and Colorado is a good football team.""
- UT head coach Mack Brown

First BCS Standings Due Today

The first Bowl Championship Series standings are going to be released today
(Monday) and the Longhorns should rank just about seventh, which,
coincidentally, is where they are in both major polls this week.
What that mean is that Texas has a very good chance to land one of the four
major BCS bowl spots if they take care of business and win their final four
games to finish the regular season at 10-1.
Upsets have thinned the ranks of unbeaten teams in the last two weeks,
leaving only eight teams in major college football with perfect records.
They are No. 1 Miami, No. 2 Oklahoma, No. 3 Nebraska, No. 4 UCLA, No. 5
Virginia Tech, No. 10 Maryland, No. 14 Washington State and No. 16 Brigham
Young.
At least two of those teams will lose in the near future because Oklahoma and
Nebraska clash this week and Washington State and UCLA meet in early November.
The top two teams in the final BCS standings will play for the national title
in the Rose Bowl on January 3.
Texas coach Mack Brown and his Longhorns hope to be in that game, but their
chances are somewhere between very slim and none because Oklahoma would have
to lose twice in the regular season for that to happen and then the Horns
would have to beat the Big 12 North winner, probably Nebraska.
But, by winning out and finishing 10-1, the Longhorns would have a great
chance to play in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans in the post-season.

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system

"Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit","Thursday December 20 5:39 AM ET 
Bids Open for Enron Trading Unit
By KRISTEN HAYS, Associated Press Writer 
HOUSTON (AP) - A U.S. bankruptcy judge has set in motion the bidding process for embattled Enron Corp.'s once-dominant trading operation, which some Wall Streets insiders say could fetch up to $1 billion. 
Enron said at a hearing Wednesday before Judge Arthur Gonzalez in New York that it would allow parties to bid for all or part of the wholesale trading unit. 
Enron lawyer Martin J. Bienenstock said none of the 14 potential bidders to come forward so far have expressed interest in bidding for Enron's book of contracts, which Enron values at $5 billion to $7 billion. 
Bids are due Jan. 7; an auction will be held Jan. 10. 
Bienenstock said bidders are wary of the potential liabilities in the contracts and that the short time frame does not allow for a full review of the books. The company, however, wants to complete the auction as soon as possible to avoid losing traders to other financial companies. 
In Enron's home base of Houston Wednesday, a federal judge ruled that a state court should decide whether Enron must give rival Dynegy Inc. a key natural gas pipeline. 
Dynegy claims Enron signed away its right to Northern Natural Gas Co. pipeline, a prized 16,500-mile system running between Texas and the Midwest, in exchange for $1.5 billion invested in Enron before a proposed merger of the two competitors collapsed in late November. 
Enron claims its smaller rival illegally terminated the $8.4 billion deal and therefore has no right to the pipeline. Enron and had argued that Dynegy's claim should be part of Enron's massive bankruptcy case filed in federal court in New York. 
U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon ruled that Dynegy's suit should be heard in state court because the company's claim was not a core element of the bankruptcy. Harmon noted that Dynegy could have sued Enron if the former energy giant didn't seek Chapter 11 protection. 
``It's what we predicted,'' said David Burns, a lawyer representing Dynegy in the lawsuit. ``If we don't have Northern Natural Gas turned over to us promptly, we will ask the court to provide an accelerated trial date on this.'' 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined comment on the decision. 
Dynegy sued Enron in Texas state court in Houston the day after Enron filed one of the largest Chapter 11 bankruptcies in U.S. history Dec. 2 and sued Dynegy for $10 billion for breach of contract in New York. 
Dynegy and other creditors also have asked that the bankruptcy case be moved to Houston, where Enron, Dynegy and many of Enron's 800 or so creditors are based. Gonzalez will consider those requests Jan. 7. 
Also Wednesday, nearly 40 of some 4,500 Enron employees laid off after the company filed for bankruptcy gathered outside Enron headquarters here to discuss the company's severance policy and sign a complaint to Enron on the lack of information. 
Some carried signs that displayed the word ``Moron'' under Enron's logo and said ``What were they thinking?'' Others wore T-shirts that said ``The Execs Who Stole Christmas.'' 
Gonzalez on Dec. 4 $1.5 billion in short-term financing to keep the company afloat and fund $4,500 severance payments. 
Former workers received those checks last week, but revelations that nearly 600 employees deemed critical to Enron's survival received more than $100 million in retention payments upset those entitled to more money under Enron's severance policy, they said. 
The company's severance policy says eligible workers are entitled to a week's pay for each full or partial year of employment and another week's pay for each $10,000 they earned in salary, up to a maximum of 26 weeks. 
``We would like the company to honor its commitment,'' said Pete Chase, 31, who worked for Enron Energy Services for 18 months. 
Denne said the company cannot approve any severance payments above $4,500 for each employee without Gonzalez' approval. Employees can file claims with the judge for more severance pay. Instructions on how to do so are available on Enron's Web site (www.enron.com). 
``The next step for Enron is for its creditors to assess its financial condition and assets,'' Denne said. ``Every employee is absolutely free to file a claim.'' 
Enron, formerly No. 7 on the Fortune 500 with stock trading near $90 a year ago, plummeted into bankruptcy after revelations of hidden debt and overstated earnings in October siphoned investor confidence and prompted traders to flee from what was once the world's largest buyer and seller of natural gas. 
Dynegy abandoned a plan to buy Enron for $8.4 billion when it continued to reveal serious financial problems and Enron's credit was downgraded to junk. 
Dynegy shares rose $3.08 to close at $23.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. Enron shares were down 6 cents to 44 cents, also on the NYSE.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Subject:	results of football pool

Hello Everyone,

	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners. Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week. Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game. Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville. In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people. 

	Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong. Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points. Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win. George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored. There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62. 

	There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon. I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win. Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2. If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it. I do not want to go more than $3 for now. Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars. This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people. 
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

"FW: Move Related Issues","

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

The infected email has the following characteristics :
Subject :	Hi

An alternative version of the infected email also have an Excel spreadsheet attachment.

If you receive this email, DELETE it immediately. DO NOT CLICK ON THE WEB LINK. DO NOT LAUNCH THE EXCEL ATTACHMENT!

Please note that opening the email automatically via the ""preview pane"" does NOT launch the virus.

The Enron global messaging service has taken the necessary steps to ensure all internet email sent to your Enron internet address is virus free. But there are ways that you can ensure viruses do not make their way into our environment  :

Always ensure you do not launch attachments or web links received from people you do not know. 

Always ensure that you do not access/launch/download any attachments from external (web-based) email service providers while you are using the Enron network.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Dean, Clint  
Sent:	Tuesday, October 09, 2001 2:57 PM
To:	Curry, Mike; Jester, Larry
Subject:	industrial load locations

Gentlemen,
I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.  

Airproducts [Curry, Mike]   - north(dallas) max=24mw min=10mw, south (houston)max=224mw min=123mw 
Alcoa [Curry, Mike]   - 25 MW in the south (valley - point comfort) 
BOC gases
Corrugated Services
Crown
Huntsman
Kinder Morgan
Koch
Praxair [Curry, Mike]   - South(reliant) max=115mw min=90mw, South(TNMP)-5mw 
TotalFina

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks, 
Clint

"ERCOT Budget Items","It has come to the attention of RMS that many items that had been
identified as requested/required ERCOT system changes were inadvertently
not included in the ERCOT 2002 budget.  I have attached a spreadsheet
with more detail regarding these items.

Three PRRs (258, 259, 260) and one PIP were included in the budget.  We
also had one PRR (261 - CR Notification) that had been returned to RMS
and TX SET for changes and resubmission that was not included.  This PRR
was a High Priority/High Impact RMS issue previously identified in our
RMS workshops.  PRRs 262, 263, 264, 265, and 266 were all approved by
TAC but we are unsure where these items fit in the budget process and
the status of the associated ERCOT system changes.

In addition, we also have the following items that were not included:
*	Three approved change controls (Nos. 155, 178 and 179)
*	Two emergency changes that ERCOT and MPs request be implemented
ASAP:  (1) CR cancellation of a switch and (2) Premise Info Rejects
*	Four additional items that require ERCOT system change requests

RMS also feels that once the market opens on January 2, 2002, there is a
huge potential that additional issues/problems requiring system changes
will become evident and that there needs to be some type of contingency
funding for these types of items that have not yet been identified.

The majority of changes on the retail side do not require protocol
revisions and as I have mentioned previously, there is no documented
process, procedures, or prioritization for ERCOT System Change Requests.
I feel like this is one reason that these items were not originally
included in the budget.

On behalf of RMS, I would appreciate your assistance in getting these
key items added to the ERCOT 2002 budget.  I have spoken to Cheryl
Moseley about these items also.   Please feel free to contact me if you
have any questions.  Thanks for your time and assistance.

To whom it may concern:

For January 2, 2002, the in order to pass phase II within the CISO market, I agreed to take a schedule from the DA to the HA in NP15 with the APX.  The schedule is for 17mw on peak.  I built a load zone in PGE3 (ST Cali) and took the trade with the APX to zero.  Please be sure to reempliment the original schedule.  I spoke with Max @ the APX and the schedule was changed because the APX could not verify the schedule with their customer (Sierra Pacific Holdings).  If you have any questions please give me a call.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","tEXas tailgatES talk

Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of
the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma
Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is
I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

45-17

Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise
on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas
adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running
game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got
his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day
with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing
lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary
to the tune of 5 touchdown passes. All in all, the much-anticipated OU
hangover did not come to pass. Texas took care of the weaker opponent,
as they should have.
___________________________________________________________
Colorado
2:30 pm
ABC telecast

ESPN Gameday (the radio edition, not the t.v. show) will be here for
the game. Texas comes in ranked #8, and CU comes in ranked #14. This
is a game both teams need to validate their seasons. Texas needs to
show the world, and themselves, that they can indeed win a big game.
A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a
probable 10-win season (no offense, Aggies), while a loss could send
this team into a tailspin. Colorado, much like Texas, is a different
team at home. They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder, but now
must show they have grown up and can win on the road. This is a HUGE
game. If the 'horns hold serve, they should sail into College Station
9-1, with a BCS birth on the line. This will not be easy. Texas has
not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does. The Buffs are #2
in the Big XII/#13 in the nation in rushing offense (224.7 ypg).
National t.v. coverage, temperature in the high 70's, 2 top 15 teams
getting after it? I wouldn't want it any other way.


___________________________________________________________

There will be no television for the Missouri game. The Texas Athletic
Department has asked the Missouri A.D. to allow a pay-per-view
broadcast for next week. The final decision has not been made
(as of Wednesday morning). If the game is on pay-per-view, it will be
at 2:30, if it is not, it will be at 1:00. For those of you going to
Columbia, the tailgate party will be at the Holiday Inn in Spanky's
Sports Bar. I will have a start time as soon as I know a game time.
It will be posted on the link below:

http://www.texasexes.org/chapters/TexasTailgates.html

The Baylor tailgate will be at George's Party Zone on Dutton Avenue
(just east of Floyd Casey Stadium) and is hosted by the Waco Texas
Exes. Start time will be announced next week. Plans for the Texas
A&M game are still being discussed. Click the link below for more
information.

___________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Chris Simms tied a school record with 5 touchdown passes vs.
Oklahoma State (James Brown-'94- vs. Baylor). It's amazing what a
running game will do for you.
* Cedric Benson now ranks #10 on the all time single-game freshman
rushing record with his 131 yards. Charles Hunter holds the record
with 187 (Houston - '87).
* Benson was also named the starter for the CU game. His reign begins.
* Look for Texas to run the 3-4 and the 4-3 this week. The way the Buffs
run the ball, Texas will show them many different looks.
* Last week Texas A&M threw for 334 yards vs. CU. 334 yards from a
team that HATES to throw. Look for the 'horns to throw early to set
up the run.
* Injury update: Kalen Thornton (knee) is returning to practice this
week. The defensive end should be ready to this weekend. The news is
not as good for another de, O.J. McClintock (lacerated arm). Look for
him to redshirt this year, unless they absolutely must have him.
* Colorado starting cb Roderick Sneed is out for this game with a
pulled hamstring, and his backup, Phil Jackson, has a broken hand.
3rd team corner on Roy/B.J./Sloan/Tony/Kyle? Nice.
* Some Buffalo news you may not have heard: Jashon Sykes, the
All-America candidate at middle linebacker, is done for the year with
a herniated disc. His backup, Joey Johnson, was the Defensive Big XII
Player of the Week last week.

___________________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Nebraska beat Baylor, 48-7, but that's not the story, this is:
the Cornhuskers had 641 yards rushing in the game. They had 4 backs
go over 100 yards. 641 yards in one game. That's almost twice what
Baylor has for the season (374).
* Texas Tech whipped the Purple Wildcats from Kansas St, 38-19. Kliff
Kingsbury threw for 409 yards and 4 touchdowns for the Red Raiders,
the most passing yards ever allowed by K-State. The Wildcats are
circling the drain. They are 0-3 in conference and 2-3 overall.
They draw the Aggies this week, while Tech gets a head check at
Nebraska. Good luck, Raiders.
* Texas A&M seems to run into the same wall when they don't play well:
turnovers from sacks. Quarterback Mark Farris has fumbled 3 times
after being hit from the blindside, and all 3 have been returned for
touchdowns, the last one vs. Colorado.
* OU has named Jason White their starting quarterback, benching
ineffective Nate Hybl. A quarterback controversy, how interesting.


Have a good weekend. See you at the Alumni Center on Saturday!

Subject:	Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation


        I want to thank you for your cooperation in responding to my previous notice regarding the suspension of our document retention policy.

        Through the excellent work of our  IT group, we have now secured our electronic media as needed for litigation purposes.  Accordingly, except as noted below, we will now return to our normal electronic document retention policy.

        In order that we may capture all possible electronic information related to the litigation, please do the following:

        1.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6800.

        2.      If you have any voice mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any voice mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the voice mails to  x3-6801.

        3.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to the LJM Deal or Chewco Investments L.P., including any accounting issues related to these transactions, please forward the e-mails to  LJM.Litigation@enron.com.

        4.      If you have any e-mails that relate in any way to Enron's public statements regarding EBS, Azurix, New Power Co., or any  e-mail regarding financial transactions involving these matters, including accounting issues related to these matters, please forward the e-mails to ClassAction.Litigation@enron.com.

        ""LJM Deal"" includes LJM Cayman L.P., LJM Co-Investment L.P., TNPC1, Margaux1, Cortez (TNPC), Osprey1, Avici, Catalytica, Fishtail (Pulp & Paper), Backbone, ENA CLO (Merlin), Nowa Sarzyna (Poland), Bob West, MEGS, Yosemite, EECC Turbines (Blue Dog), Raptor 1, Raptor 1a, Raptor 2, Raptor 2a, Raptor 3, Raptor 4, Rawhide, LJM2/WW Loan Agrmt, Osprey 2 LLC1, Rythms, Osprey, Cuiaba,  and LJM Cayco Investments.

Also, please forward all future e-mails and voice mails that relate to the above-referenced subjects to the appropriate e-mail address or voice mail box.  These procedures will ensure that our electronic documents and voice mails are properly preserved.

        Over the next month, our lawyers will be collecting our traditional files, i.e., written documents, for possible production in litigation.  In the meantime, please retain all of your hard-copy files that in any way relate to:

        1.      The LJM Deal 
        2.      Azurix 
        3.      New Power Co. 
        4.      EBS 
        5.      Chewco Investments L.P.
        6.      Accounting for any Enron investments 
        7.      Any Enron public statement made to the investment public 
        8.      Any Enron public filing with the SEC or other regulatory bodies 

        Please err on the side of retention of documents. 

        If you have any questions, please call Andrew Edison at x5-7105.

"Drop to POLR issue","All,
I appreciate all of the input I received in response to my email on the
Drop to POLR issue.  I have taken a few comments in mind in restructuring
the text.  I have not adjusted it much however, and there is a reason for
this.  The postcard which ERCOT mails out  has a limit of 600 characters
(spaces included) to use on either side of the card.  So when comments came
back I had to adjust the Drop to POLR language on a very limited basis,
especially when you take into effect how the Spanish translation will be
adjusted.  What I have below is my proposal of how the English and Spanish
translations should look on the postcard when mailed to the customer.  The
only language added to the post card is the text that is denoted between
the double asterisks below (**).  Right now the English stands at (503)
characters, while the Spanish side stands at (593).  I must offer a great
deal of thanks to those who were helpful working on the Spanish
translation, it was a very difficult standard to meet.  This proposed
language fully complies with ERCOT's requirement. I believe the language is
simple yet explanatory enough to provide either English or Spanish speaking

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.

I am in the process of putting together an ERCOT industrial load database.  It will be something that in the future will help us value load in Texas.  As you know, one of the factors in determining price is location.  Could you please provide me with the locations of these customers so that I can correctly assign a CSC zone to them.

I know this is a fairly generic list, but it is straight from the ERCOT region list that structure keeps, so hopefully it will be very familiar to both of you.

Thanks, 
Clint

"Re: FW: You still suck at baseball....","Ollie,

Congrats on hooking up with a little long-term action.  Always thought you'd be one of the first to go.  Send her down south to Portland if it looks like she's getting board with your ""itsy bitsy"".

I've kept in touch with Carl and Brett but not much else.  Funny how time can just slip by.  I think back to the days in school and yup...just like I thought, everything seems so cool.  I think of how nice it would be to have scores of friends within a block and three bars to choose from... but it didn't seem that super at the time.  I specifically remember getting pissed on a Tuesday night, playing darts at Shakers with throngs of 20 something girls around and shrugging it off as ""boring"".  

You may be suprised to hear it, but I am still on with Enron and looking forward to a buyout in a week or so.  As strange as it may seem, this whole fiscad may have been a huge blessing in disguise...I'll just keep my fingers crossed.

I'm doing a lot of skiing this year.  Let me know when and where we should meet up.  I'd like to see the likes of Toby, Ty, Nate, Ken and even Palmy.

Part 2

Recruiting Roundup

The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky
at this time.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas, but is setting up
visits to Oklahoma (he was once committed to the Sooners) and several other
schools.
WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael
Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week, but then they both
decommitted.
Williams attended Texas A&M's game Saturday and plans to come to take an
official visit to Texas the December 14 weekend.
* * * *
The Longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or
more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in
Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel;
LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1,
320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl
Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of
Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona;
OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260,
4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year. However, he injured a
knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a
lot of academic ground to cover to graduate.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;
LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,
4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round
Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North
Lamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,
5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * *
The Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of
them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent
Young of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of
Houston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony
Wright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of
Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,
Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs
Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey
Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and
Lindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool
of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
If the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four
top players on my 25-man ""difference-maker"" list.
They already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.
1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.
If Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the
leader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.
The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at
kicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the
best I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five
yards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.
* * * *
INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many
years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. Consider this item
in last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50
national  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled ""8
Players to watch:
""Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something
special.""

Game Quotes . .

""We were able to spread the field today because (tight end) Bo Scaife made
some great catches and that opened things up. I think Bo gives us the ability
to stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the
defense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris
(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half.""
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on
the ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting
some three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it
up. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai
Pearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin
Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we
decided to give him the primary coverage on him.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our
offensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told
me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep
running and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the
record book.""
- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he
is the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at
Texas
* * * *
""I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was
getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and
our wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to
them.""
- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones
for 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns
* * * *
""We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA
(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day.""
- UT quarterback Chris Simms
* * * *
""When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the
Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game
came as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS.""
- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams
* * * *
""He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen
this year.""
- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin
Jammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards

Key Statistics

Missouri had 10 possessions and five of them were three-and-out series, while
another gained only four yards in four plays and ended with an interception.
The Tigers also started both halves with terrible offensive statistics,
making zero first downs in the first quarter and one first down in the third
quarter.

Scouting Baylor

Texas will play at Baylor at 11:30 a.m. Saturday in a game that will be
televised by Fox Syndication.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 5  in both polls, are 7-1, while the Bears are 2-5.
Texas is a 34-point favorite.
Baylor has lost five straight after opening the season with a 24-3 victory
over Arkansas State and a 16-13 win over New Mexico.
The Bears then lost to Iowa State, 41-0; Texas A&M 16-10; Nebraska, 48-7;
Oklahoma, 33-17, and Texas Tech, 63-19.
QB Greg Cicero, a former Longhorn, is the Bears' main offensive threat
As you can see from the teams' respective national rankings below, Baylor has
had trouble running the ball. There are 115 Division 1 teams playing football
and the Bears are 113th in rushing and also 113th in total offense and 112th
in scoring.
The Baylor defense has been tough at times, particulary in the 16-10 loss to
A&M.
But this is a game the Longhorns should win easily. Look for RB Cedric Benson
to extend his UT true freshman record of three straight 100-yard rushing
games to four and look for QB Chris Simms to have a great day.
It also should be a good day for the Longhorn defense to get back in the top
10 nationally.
Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Texas                    Baylor
Offense
(42)     169.1       Rushing Avg.        (113)    79.9
(43)     236.1       Passing Avg.         (86)   176.4
(42)     405.2      Total Off. Avg.     (113)  256.3
(7)        38        Scoring Avg         (112)    10.3
Defense
(12)       96        Rushing Avg.         (88)   194
(8)       163.1      Passing Avg.          85)   238.3
(4)       259.1     Total Def. Avg.       (94)   432.3
(6)        13.5  Opp. Scoring Avg          (92)   31

Longhorn Notes . .

Starting guard Antwan Kirk-Hughes sprained an ankle in practice last week and
was held out of the Missouri game. Coach Mack Brown said Derrick Dockery and
Tillman Holloway played well at guard. ""We have three really good guards,"" he
said.
* * * *
QB Chris Simms climbed into fourth place on the Longhorn list for touchdown
passes. He has 28 after throwing four against Missouri. He passed Shea Morenz
and Bobby Layne, who had 24 each. Peter Gardere is in third place with 37.
Major Applewhite holds the school record with 58 career touchdown passes.
* * * *
WR Roy Williams had five receptions and a touchdown pass to move into 10th
and 5th places, respectively, in the UT career charts.

Unfortunately, no.  We have friends coming in town-Scott and Mandy from Dallas.  We thought the 4 of us were going to be able to go to the game.  However, Scott's hookup for tickets fell through.  Therefore, we will be watching it at my house.  It would probably be rude of me to go with you and leave them there.  You should come over after the game.  And, you are welcome to stay with us Saturday night.  We need to catch up.  We may go out on the boat Sunday if the weather is nice.

"COME EARLY, BE LOUD, STAY LATE","This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.

Game Quotes . .

""We actually had an Aggie block. We'd worked on it all week, but it wasn't
working, so we went back to our regular block ande I just had to beat the guy
in front of me. When I saw it was a linebacker, I knew he was in trouble.
Linebackers aren't quick enough to block me. If I can't get by a big old guy
like that, I don't deserve my scholarship.""
- Longhorn cornerback Rod Babers, who blocked the punt that resulted in UT's
first-quarter touchdown
* * * *
""We were both on the right side (he and Babers) and they weren't zone
blocking like we do. They were in man-for-man, and all we had to do was beat
the guy in front of us. That's my first touchdown as a special teams player.""
- Texas wide receiver Tony Jeffery, who scooped up the ball Babers blocked
and ran it in for the game's first touchdown
* * * *
""We did a good job against the run. I thought Maurice Gordon probably played
as good as he's every played for us. Their center (All-Big 12 Seth McKinney)
is a good ball player and at times he couldn't block him. I thought all our
guys played pretty well today. This was a good old-fashioned football game,
with both teams playing good defense, and a break or two deciding the
outcome.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese
* * * *
""We felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there, we'd
eventually get the running game going, and Cedric (Benson) and the offensive
line did a great job in the fourth quarter. With Cedric, you don't have to
abandon the running game because you know he'll break loose sooner or later.
We didn't want to take too many chances and give them a short field because
we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense
playing so well.""
 - Texas defensive coordinator Greg Davis
* * * *
""It never got easier, but it did get better. I think our linemen finally wore
them down and I started getting a little more room. It would have been nice
to get 1,000 yards, but winning the game is the main thing, and we did that.""
 - Texas running back Cedric Benson
* * * *
""Give the Longhorns some credit. Their defense is really good. It ranks with
any we have seen this year.""
- A&M quarterback Mark Farris
* * * *
""The game was up for grabs in the fourth quarter. They just made some plays.
It was 7-7 and they did what they had to do in the fourth quarter to go up,
14-7. They have some great offensive weapons, and we held them in check for
most of the game.""
- A&M head coach R. C. Slocum

Key Statistics

Texas A&M started three drives in Texas territory and the Aggies scored their
touchdown on a 27-yard drive on one of them, but missed a field goal and
punted on
the other two possessions. Texas started two drives in Aggie territory, both
in the fourth quarter, and scored touchdowns on both drives.

Scouting Colorado

Texas and Colorado meet for the second time Saturday at 7 p.m. in Irving's
Texas Stadium in the Big 12 Conference Championship Game.
It will be televised nationally by ABC and it should be a good one. Texas is
an 8-point favorite.
The Longhorns mauled the Buffaloes, 41-7, on Oct. 20 in Austin, but that
Colorado team bore little resemblance to the one that hung a 62-36 lashing on
No. 1-ranked Nebraska Saturday.
For starters, Bobby Pesavento, who passed for 202 yards against Nebraska, got
his first start against Texas and he looked like a first-time starter.
He was a poised, confident sharpshooter Saturday against Nebraska, the
perfect complement for the Buffs' power running game that produced 380 yards
and eight rushing touchdowns against the proud Blackshirt defense of Nebraska.
Sophomore Chris Brown scored a school record six rushing touchdowns while
rushing for 198 yards. He had 26 yards against Texas in October.
 Colorado is 9-2. It's only losses were 24-22 in the season opener with
Fresno State and the one at Texas. The nine victories were 41-14 over
Colorado State, 51-15 over San Jose State, 27-16 over Kansas, 16-6 over
Kansas State, 31-21 over Texas A&M, 22-19 over giant-killer Oklahoma State,
38-24 over Missouri, 40-27 over Iowa State and, of course, the big one over
Nebraska.
Texas won the first game against Colorado by using four first-half turnovers
to take a 24-7 lead and force the Buffaloes the abandon their running game
and try to play catchup.
In that game, Colorado had 244 yards offensively in the first half, but was
stymied by a fumble at the UT 4 on first-and goal, a fumble at the CU 21 that
set up a Texas field goal, and another fumble at the Buff 35 that set up
another UT touchdown.
Unless history repeats and the Horns force more early turnovers, this game
will be a terrific challenge for Texas.
I think there are three keys to a UT victory:
1. Win the turnover battle again.
2. Keep balance between running and passing, but challenge the Buffs suspect
pass defense frequently.
3. Slow down Colorado's power running game, which ranks No. 9 nationally at
229 yards a game.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis):

Last Meeting Highlights

When Texas beat Colorado, 41-7, on October 20 in Austin, QB Chris Simms
completed17 of 28 passes for 234 yards and 3 touchdowns, and freshman RB
Cedric Benson had 23 carries for 100 yards and 2 touchdowns. The Longhorn
defense gave up 244 yards in the first half, but forced four game-turning
turnovers.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown has told his team and Longhorn fans all season that good
things happen to teams who keep winning.
After a mid-season loss to Oklahoma, the Longhorns have reeled off six
straight wins, and Oklahoma State's stunning upset of Oklahoma Saturday gave
Texas the Big 12 Southern Division title.
""Obviously,"" he said, ""we are excited about it because it proves to our guys
that when people questioned whether their season was over after the Oklahoma
game, that it wasn't.""
""They realized that what they needed to do was take care of their business
and there might be some good things that happen at the end.""
""Our team could've taken the Missouri game or the Baylor game for granted,
but they didn't. They took care of their business every week. They didn't
worry about the BCS and now they've got themselves in position for a
championship game for the second time in three years.""
""We are really, really excited. I am proud of our team and of the way they
played at College Station. What an awful thing it would have been if we had
not taken care of business (Friday) in College Station and this would have
happened (OU's loss Saturday).""
""So, give credit to our team for being mature, playing hard and putting
themselves in position to have a rematch with Colorado.""
He also said the Longhorns' 41-7 victory over Colorado in Austin back on
October 20 means little because ""this isn't the same Colorado team we played
at mid-season.""
""Any team that can get 62 points against Nebraska gets your attention,"" he
said. "" I think it is obvious that Colorado is a great football team. They
are running the ball as good as anybody in the country right now.""
""What a great challenge it will be for our defense, which has played as good
as any defense  in the country,"" he said. ""That will be a great matchup.""
Brown said the Longhorn offense had a tough day against A&M. ""We will need to
play better on offense in this game and what a great challenge it will be to
try to stop Colorado from running the ball as well as they ran it against
Nebraska,"" he said.
Brown also said Saturday's game is huge because it is for the Big 12
Championship
""You always want to win your conference championship,"" he said. ""It is one of
your first goals each year. This is our second opportunity to win a
conference championship in four years here and are we excited.""
""The BCS is not an issue today and a bowl game is not an issue today,"" he
said. ""This is what you fight to get into, but when you get there, you've got
to win. After that, you try to look up and figure out where you are.""
But Brown said beating Colorado again is a huge challenge for the Longhorns.
""If our guys weren't convinced before the Nebraska game, we will convince
them that this Colorado team is different,"" he said.
""Give (Colorado coach)  Gary Barnett credit. He took his kids to Texas
Stadium this summer and said that is where we want to end up, and as of
(Saturday), nobody thought that Colorado and Texas would end up in this ball
game.""
""So, give both teams credit,"" Brown said. ""It is two teams that have been
down this year and have gotten themselves back up, gone back to work and are
playing as well as anyone in the country at the end of the year.""
""One of the things that we have talked about with this team is respect. You
need to respect yourself and your teammates, but you also need to respect
your opponent. Every Saturday has to be a real important game for us and a
really exciting game for us. Our guys will play hard this Saturday because
they understand what is at stake.""
""To win the conference championship in this league,"" Brown said, ""you have to
beat the same team twice a lot of the time. That is something that is just
there. To be the champion you have to do it, so we are excited about it.
There is no question that it is harder, because they will have a lot of
motivation coming in. But we are also going to have a lot of motivation
coming in to try to be the champions of the Big 12.""
He said the players and coaches are excited about the challenge.
""This is a championship game week,"" he said. ""You understand that this is 
like playing your biggest rival and that makes it fun. What we have to do to
win the championship every year is play a huge rival like Texas A&M and then
play this game the next week. We need to get used to that.""
""There are a lot of things that are different now in the Big 12 that they
were around here for a long time with the Southwest Conference. One of them
is being able to play big game after big game and especially at the end of
the year.""
""We have been here before, but we haven't taken the other step yet. This is
the week for us to take the other step and win the championship.""
""Our players are the reason why we are here. Different things have happened
throughout the year and this was just the latest one.""
""The reason we are playing in this game is our assistant coaches and our
players have worked really hard to take advantage of every opportunity that
they have had since the Oklahoma game. They never got their head down and
still believed. They kept themselves in a position to win if the opportunity
came up.""
Brown had planned a big recruiting push this week, but said, 'We will put our
recruiting on hold. All of the coaches could go out on Monday for the first
time and be in schools and the homes, but  the players out there will
understand that our recruiting will be better by winning the championship
game.""

Scouting Missouri

Texas will play at Missouri Saturday in a game that will start at 1 p.m. and,
despite prior announcements, will not be televised - not even on a pay per
view basis.
The Longhorns, ranked No. 7 in both polls, are 6-1, while the Tigers are
unranked at 3-3.
Missouri opened the season with a 20-13 loss to Bowling Green, then thumped
Southwest Texas, 40-6, before getting mauled by Nebraska, 36-3.
Then the Tigers beat Oklahoma State, 41-38, in a triple overtime, before
losing to Iowa State, 20-14, and then outscoring Kansas 38-34.
Tiger QB Kirk Farmer has had a hot hand in recent weeks, and he kept both
teams in the game last week, blistering Kansas with 246 yards and three
touchdowns passing, plus another 82 rushing yards. But he also had two
interceptions run back for touchdowns.
Farmer, a 6-5, 210-pound junior, has completed 73 of 147 passes for 804 yards
and 8 touchdowns, but he was very productive in the Tigers' three most recent
games.
He also is a slippery runner who is a great scrambler.
WR Justin Gage, a 6-5, 205-pound junior, is one of the nation's most
productive pass receivers. He has caught 45 passes for 518 yards and 3 TDs
and ranks second in the Big 12 in receptions per game with a 7.5 average.
RB Zack Abron, a 5-10, 230-pound sophomore,  is the main threat on the
ground. He has rushed 94 times for 453 yards and 5 TDs. That's an average of
4.8 yards per carry.
New coach Gary Pinkel inherited eight offensive and six defensive starters
from a 3-8 team, and he has shifted players around, particularly on defense,
to try to get more speed on the field.
I had to use Big 8 statistics in my team comparisons this week because the
NCAA defensive statistics and rankings were not available at press time.
As you can see from the statistics below, the Longhorns appear to be far
superior to the Tigers.
This is a game the Longhorns should win and will win if they:
1. Avoid costly turnovers
2. Keep on running the ball to provide more offensive balance
3. Get their usual great defensive game.

Here's how the teams compare statistically (Big 12 rank in parenthesis):
Texas                    Missouri
Offense
(5)     165.9        Rushing Avg.          (6)   165

Big 12 Roundup

The Big 12 is down to two teams with perfect records and one of those will
fall Saturday when Nebraska plays host to Oklahoma.
Both unbeaten powerhouses struggled in their games last week, undoubtedly
because their thoughts kept drifting to the big showdown in Lincoln.
Iowa State travels to Texas A&M in another key conference game because both
clubs are 3-1 in league play.

Buckman Close to Decision

Brad Buckman, the 6-8 Austin Westlake forward who is the object of the big
recruiting battle between Texas and North Carolina, is very close to making
his choice.
In fact, two North Carolina internet sites claim he has already made it and
the Tar Heels are the winners.
Buckman isn't saying. He says he has always been a Texas fan, but really
likes North Carolina and the ACC because basketball is so important in that
area.

Top Women Visit

Center LaToya Davis, 6-2, of Houston South Houston, took her official visit
to Texas last weekend after visiting Texas Tech the previous week.
Davis, the state's top uncommitted player, has narrowed her choices to those
two schools and is expected to make her decision this week.
Three top juniors also took unofficial visits to Texas the same weekend. They
are Kalee Carey, 6-5, of Canyon, 6-1 Destiny Drew of Crosby and 6-0 Emily
Niemann of Houston Westbury Christian.


UT Men, Women Picked 5th

The Longhorns aren't getting alot of respect in basketball.
The Texas men and women were both picked to finish fifth in a poll of Big 12
coaches last week.
The men's coaches picked 6-8 Chris Owens to the All-Big 12 first team and
tabbed 5-11 freshman point guard T. J. Ford as co-newcomer of the year.
The women's coaches didn't name any Longhorns to their honor teams, which
probably was a mistake because the Longhorn women were headed toward a very
good season last year when a rash of injuries destroyed their chances.
With an outstanding group of incoming recruits, the Longhorn women will have
much more depth this year.

Turnover Troubles

Texas is 6-1 and Colorado is 5-2. You knew that, didn't you?
But did you know that in the two games Colorado lost, the Buffaloes suffered
nine turnovers (five against Fresno State and four against Texas) and did not
cause a single one?
 And did you know that in the game the Longhorns lost they gave up four
turnovers against Oklahoma without gaining a single one?
What that statistic proves is that going 0-13 in turnovers is a really
sure-fire formula for going 0-3 in games.

"Enron Net Works and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing announce new procedure for using 800-97-Enron telephone number","As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.

Kearney Recruits Terrific Class
Five of the nation's top prep track and field prospects, including four state
champions and one national high school record-holder, have signed with
Longhorn women's track coach Beverly Kearney.
The class is headed by four of the nation's top sprinters - Ychlindria Spears
of Luling, who also is the national record holder in the triple jump; Ashlee
Williams of Dallas Bishop Dunne, who also had the nation's top high hurdles
clocking last season; state Class 4A 100, 200 and triple jump champ LaToya
Phelps of Greenville; Florida sprint-jump star Sanya Richards of Fort
Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, and relay ace Sheretta Jones of Houston Forest
Brook.
""We are really excited about the class we have coming in for the 2003
season,"" Kearney said. ""The quality of this class is phenomenal and this may
be one of the best we've put together since we've been here.""
""Each athlete in this class is an exceptional signee, but together they take
it to a whole other level. They are competitive, mature and focused, and we
are extremely excited about the quality of individuals we are bringing into
the program.""
Kearney's class is headlined by Spears, who was the 2001 Gatorade National
High School Girls' Track and Field Athlete of the Year as a junior.
The nation's top prep female jumper and a proven sprinter, Spears set a
national high school record in the triple jump with a 44-2 1/4 mark at the
2001 Texas 3A State Championships last May.
Besides winning the triple at last spring's state meet, Spears claimed gold
in the long jump and swept the 100- and 200-meter dashes on her way to
scoring all 40 of Luling's third-place points.
Her season-best long jump of 20-9 1/4 also led the nation last year, and she
went on to win the USATF Junior Nationals in the event with a wind-aided 20-9
3/4 effort.
She ended her junior season as the state's top performer in all
classifications in the long and triple jumps, No. 2 in the 200 (23.84) and
No. 5 in the 100 (11.64).
Prior to her junior year, Spears qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials
in the long jump where she finished 14th in her flight. Over the last three
years, Spears has won 11 out of a possible 12 gold medals at the state meet
and won over 40 events on the district, regional, state and national levels.
Spears is also an honor student, ranking in the top five percent of her class.
""Ychlindria is a phenomenal athlete who can add quality depth in the long
jump, triple jump and 100 immediately,"" Kearney said.
""She has all the tools necessary to be successful not only on the collegiate
level, but internationally as well. She is talented and versatile and we
think she is one of the most competitive athletes out there.""
Williams is one of the top prep sprinter-hurdler prospects in the country. A
standout for Dallas Bishop Dunne High on the TAPPS 4A level, she has swept
state titles in the 200, 100 hurdles and 4x100 and 4x200 relay the last two
seasons in leading Bishop Dunne to consecutive team titles
Last March, Williams set a state record in the 100 hurdles with a
personal-best 13.23 clocking at the Texas Southern Invitational in Houston.
Last summer, she struck gold in the 100 hurdles at the USATF Junior Nationals
in Richmond, Va., and at the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, Calif.
She closed her junior season as the nation's top prep performer in the 100
hurdles and No. 15 in the 100 (11.67). Williams also posted the state's third
fastest time in the 200 (23.81) and the No. 7 time in the 100.
""Ashlee is one of the fastest hurdlers to come out in several years,"" Kearney
said. ""She has the potential to develop into a great hurdler and sprinter.
She reminds me a lot of (former Longhorn track and field star) Angie Vaughn,
but she is much faster and more seasoned at this point.""
Richards has been one of the top all-around track and field performers in the
Florida high school ranks for the past three years, making her mark in the
sprints and jumps. She has led St. Thomas Aquinas to three consecutive
Florida 3A State Championships, the most recent coming last spring when she
grabbed gold in the 100, long jump and 4x100 relay and silver in the 400.
At the 2000 state meet, Richards swept the 100, 200, long jump and 4x100
relay to lead her team to a convincing 110-point win. On the national level
last summer, Richards swept the 100 and 200 at the USATF Junior Olympics and
placed fourth in the 400 at the Adidas Outdoor Championships in Raleigh, N.C.
Indoors, she was second in the 200 and third in the 60 at the New York Armory
NSIC last March.
She finished her season ranked No. 6 nationally  in the 200 (23.57) and long
jump (19-11 1/2), No. 7 in the 400 (53.47) and No. 8 in the 100 (11.59).
""Sanya is the youngest member of this class, but she is a soldier,"" Kearney
said. ""She is a team all wrapped up by herself, because she can do so many
different things.""
Phelps , who also a standout basketball player, won the 100 in 11.55, the 200
in 23.8 and the triple jump  with a 42-8 1/4 leapat the 2001 Texas 4A State
Meet.
She won district titles in the 100, 200, 4x200 relay, long jump and triple
jump and regional titles in the 100, 200 and triple jump. Her personal-best
triple jump of 42-8 1/4 ranked No. 2 nationally at the end of her junior
season.
""LaToya may be the sleeper of this class,"" Kearney said. ""She is a phenomenal
athlete and an excellent basketball player. She won three state titles last
year as a junior, and she is one of the top triple jumpers in the country.""
Jones has been one of the state's top quarter-milers as a member of perennial
power Houston Forest Brook's track and field teams the past two years. She
won district and regional titles in the 400, with a best time of 55.5, on her
way to finishing fourth in the quarter at the Texas 4A State Championships
last May.
She also helped the school's 4x400 relay squad to the district title and
runner-up finishes at the regional and state meets. As a sophomore, she
finished third in the 400 and 4x400 relay at the state meet.
""Sheretta has done an outstanding job for Forest Brook on the relays and in
the sprints,"" Kearney said. ""I look at her open performances and I think
she'll be able to contribute right away. She reminds me of (current Longhorn)
Raasin McIntosh, and we think she can end up being as good as anyone.""

UT Men Sign Great Track Class
Five top high school recruits, headed by Austin Reagan High sprinter Brendan
Christian, plus one All-American transfer from Arkansas, have signed with
Longhorn men's trackcoach Bubba Thornton. The NCAA track and field signing
period started last Wednesday and extends through this Wednesday.
In addition to Christian, the Longhorn track signees include twin brothers
Aaron and Ashton Collins of New Orleans Clark, Nicholas Johnson of Fort Worth
Wyatt, Joe Thorne of Atlanta Lakeview)and the Arkansas transfer - Jason Ward
of Tilgham HS in Paducah, Ky.
Christian is one of the nation's top sprinters in the 100 and 200, where he
holds the state Class 4A record with a 20.56 clocking at the State Meet last
May, and he also has run a 45.5 leg on Reagan's 1,600-meter relay team.
Johnson, the younger brother of Longhorn senior sprinter Amar Johnson, is
another top sprinter with a 10.33 100 meters clocking. The Collins brothers
are outstanding in the longer sprints, Thorne is one of nation's top
performers in the distance races and the steeplechase, and Ward is already
established as one of the top triple jumpers at the collegiate level.
""In our minds, this is one of the top classes in the nation,"" Thornton said.
""Each athlete has an immediate chance to contribute to our program next year.
They can have a national impact for us right away, not just in their
performances but as leaders as well.""
""Each individual has great qualities, and we're excited about this class as a
whole,"" he said. ""They all are aware of the national scene and are looking
forward to competing against NCAA-caliber athletes.""
Christian, one of the top three or four sprinters in the country, is the
defending Texas Class 4A state champion and record holder in the 200-meter
dash, as well as anchoring  Reagan's regional champion 4x100 and 4x400 relay
teams.
Christian also won 100-meter title last summer at the Adidas Outdoor Track &
Field Championships in Raleigh, N.C., and Golden West Invitational in
Sacramento, Calif. He set the national high school indoor record in the 200
(21.02) at the New York Armory NSIC in March. He  also won the 60 at that
meet and swept the 55 and 200 at the Arkansas National High School
Invitational in January. Christian enters his senior season ranked No. 2
nationally in the 200 (20.56) and No. 4 in the 100 (10.40).
Johnson is a Texas 4A district and regional 100-meter champion for perennial
track power Fort Worth Wyatt. In addition to finishing fourth at last year's
state track meet in the 100, Johnson also ran legs on the Chaparrals'
district champion and state runner-up 4x100-meter relay squad which ended the
season with the second-fastest time in the country (40.39). He ranks in the
national top 10 in the 100 (10.33w) as he enters the 2002  season.
The Collins twins have been stars on the Louisiana track and field scene for
the last three years for New Orleans Clark High. Ashton was a five-time 4A
state champion last year, winning titles in the 400 (indoor and outdoor),
800, 4x200 and 4x400 relay.
He also placed fourth in the quarter at the Golden West Invitational last
summer, and is the No. 2-ranked returning quarter-miler in the nation
(46.29). Aaron won three state crowns last year in the 200, 4x200 and 4x400
relay.
Thorne won the Georgia 5A individual cross country title in leading his
Lakeside High team to a fourth-place finish at the state meet on Nov. 3. He
also posted the second-fastest 5k time in the country this season with a time
of 14:41 at the Alexander Invitational on Oct. 6.
Thorne is the defending state champion in the 1,600 and 3,200, posting the
state's top times in both events last season. Against some of the top runners
in the country, he finished fourth in his first-ever 2,000-meter steeplechase
at the 2001 Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships.
He also placed 12th at the 2000 Foot Locker National Cross Country
Championship in Raleigh, and is one of the favorites to challenge for the
South Regional and National crowns this year.
Ward, the sophomore transfer from Arkansas, was an All-American and All-SEC
performer in the triple jump as a freshman. He skipped to a personal-best
mark of 54-6 to become the national runner-up at the 2000 NCAA Indoor
Championships in Fayetteville, Ark.
He also finished fourth at the SEC Championships with a 52-2 3/4 effort. At
Paducah Tilgham High, Ward was a five-time All-American in track and field.
He also won the triple jump at the USATF Junior Nationals in 1999.

Hello everyone, 

	More upsets in the college and pro games this week sent most people into double digit incorrect picks this week. Most people missed the Washington St/Stanford game won by Washington St; most people missed the Kansas St/Texas Tech game, won by Texas Tech; most people missed the South Carolina/Arkansas game won by Arkansas; and everyone missed the Florida/Auburn game won by Auburn. The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.

	 In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well. 

	Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis. I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight. The other 2 people still alive tonight are Steve Pan and Daniel Muschar. If Dallas wins tonight, I will win outright, if Washington wins, then it will come down to total points scored. I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37. Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts. and Steve will win with 34-35 points scored and tie with 36 pts. Daniel will win with Washington and 37 or more total points scored. 

	I came in a close second place last week to Joe Step. My picks were given as always to Todd or Dave on Friday for verification. There were a record 34 people in the pool this week, therefore the prize is $68. 

	This coming week and next week there is a pro game on Thursday night because of the baseball playoffs. Therefore, I will hand out the pools this week and next week on Tuesday and they will be due before I leave on THURSDAY afternoon. Finally, here are the results of this past weekend's picks with the number missed by each person after their name.

FERC held a discussion today on the status of NE, SE, and Midwest RTO proposals.  The FERC judges and staff gave the Commission reports from the mediations and current MISO, SPP and Alliance filings.  While there was much discussion about the appropriate model (non-profit ISO, Transco, ITC), with questions on whether congestion management models were the same or simply compatible, no decisions were made by FERC.  Chairman Wood did commit to quickly providing ""certainty"" to all stakeholders, including the investment community.  He asked FERC Staff to prepare reports on each region based on comments received at RTO week and through filed RTO week comments (Enron will file Nov. 2) and report back to FERC at the Nov. 7 meeting.

Importance:	High

Repairs to the internal coating of the demineralized water storage tank have
been completed.  Therefore, I would like to request an outage for the Sand
Hill Energy Center on Friday, October 26 from 7 AM to 4 PM.  The purpose is
to remove temporary piping and restore normal connections to the
Demineralized Water Storage Tank.  This will restore the Demin. water system
to its normal configuration.  We will not be able to operate the units while
this work is in progress.  Your immediate approval of this outage is
requested.

"Interval Data Question","Can you please clarify how interval data should be reported?

In the SR test scripts, there are up to three different values reported for
interval usage:

1.  The value reported in the QTY02 of the PTD*BO loop
2.  The value calculated from data provided in the PTD*BO loop [Ending Read
(MEA06) - Beginning Read (MEA05) * Meter Multiplier (MEA03)]
3.  Sum of intervals in PTD*PM loop

Most of these differences are due to rounding issues.  Meaning that the
number of decimal places is inconsistently applied.  Some of these rounding
issues can be significant on large usage values.  What is the standard for
these variances or the percent of tolerance?

My expectation is a clean tie (validation) between the three values listed
above.  And, for the validated usage value from the 867 to tie out to the
usage reported on the 810.  Is this an unrealistic expectation?

Thanks a bunch,

"Bankruptcy Management Committee","
In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

"Update on Credit Card Use and Company Expenses","Our Director of Corporate Travel has informed us that American Express will not be able to establish a new Corporate account for us at this time.  

Until we are able to obtain company-sponsored credit cards, when incurring company expenses it will be necessary to use personal credit cards or cash, which can then be submitted for reimbursement through the expense report system.   You may want to refrain from incurring any reimbursable expenses until we receive further assurances from the company that they have the processes in place to pay them.  As information becomes available about administrative operations, I will relay it to you.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

"Security Update","
Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Some of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business controls organization.  You can contact this organization through their website (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email (CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for the Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?	Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

?	Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

?	Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

?	Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to you or hold doors open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. 	


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommendations:

?	While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to strongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?	For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate security recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a result, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the United States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immigration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Crossing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your current lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay
