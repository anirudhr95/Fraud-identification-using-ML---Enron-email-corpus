"RE: Hey buddy","Amigo,
Good to hear from you.  Yeah, the pending merger with Dynegy will greatly impact our business.  We are not sure what the power trading desk will look like in the new structure.  Dynegy has a sizable real-time trading desk due to it's assets.  The good thing is that I just signed a two year contract, about a month ago.

How is your gig?

The Southwest Power Pool (SPP) was provided notice at 1200 on 11/2/01 that the termination will occur hour ending 24 on November 3, 2001. At that time, KCPL will no longer be a member of MAPP. KCPL will maintain its membership in SPP as a Transmission Owner under the SPP OATT. This requires a modification of how reservations under the SPP OATT should be made and how associated schedules should be submitted. Only reservations with a POR/POD of KCPL are at issue. SPP wants to take this opportunity to inform our customers of the associated changes. Please see the attached document, which has also been posted on the SPP OASIS page, on how reservations will be treated.

I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See my notes below:

M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info

The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We will not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your organization will need the information.  

Please let me know if you need me to check others for you.

rita and then head over to the dance.  Is Travis coming also?

Don, it was great talking to you about hunting and shooting today.  Below is the link to Central Flyway Outfitters (CFO).  They are a top notch guide service out of Winnie, Texas (near Beaumont) that specialize in duck and goose hunting.  They have hunting packages around $150 a gun (they offer corporate discounts as well).  All you need is a license, shells, gun, and waders:  they will take care of the transportation (4 wheelers), guide, and dog.  

I am heading down there tomorrow for a hunt with my uncle.  I will let you know how we do.  If you are interested I can arrange hunt on a future Saturday or Sunday morning.  Regards, Lyle

"FW: Manitoba Services Deal","Hey y'all,

Please, comply with the following request from Eservices.  Let's run through the paces every a.m.  In addition, please review the previous Manitoba Business Procedures.  
Thanks,
Don


An extension of the Services contract with Manitoba (MHEB) has been signed and begins tomorrow, November 1st.  In addition to purchasing from MHEB, we need to focus heavily on selling to MHEB.  With the change of season, MHEB may frequently be short.  As with purchases, EPMI will split any net savings with MHEB and adjust their Reference Price accordingly- see 'M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/Manitoba Hydro Services Deal Procedures.doc. I realize that  market conditions have not been favorable for doing much business with MHEB, but we need to give this deal more attention.  We are working on other business opportunities with MHEB, and how we handle this deal will affect future relationships with them.    In an effort to generate information with which to formulate strategies to better service MHEB, please maintain the price log located at: M:Eservices/MIDWEST SERVICE DEALS/Manitoba/MHEB Price Log/MHEB November'01.doc. In addition to prices, both hourly and next day, record any relevant market information (see the log for examples). Include responsibility for handling MHEB in the daily transition to the night shift.  Dean will coordinate these efforts. Please call me (cell - 713-962-0526) with any questions.  Thank you!

One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to
look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery
substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by
Coach R.C.
Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.

After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign

"FW: Hunting Joke","Frank was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He
spotted a small brown bear and shot
it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a
big black bear. The black bear
said: ""You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have
rough sex.""
Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,
Frank soon recovered and
vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black
bear and shot it.
There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear
stood right next to him.
The grizzly said: ""That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two
choices. Either I maul
you to death or we have REALLY rough sex.""Again, Frank thought it was
better to
comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before
Frankfinally recovered.
Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly
and shot it.
He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He
turned around to find a giant polar bear
standing there. The polar bear said: ""Admit it, Frank, you don't come
here for the hunting, do you?""

Yes, I believe we will.  It is a $1000 penalty -- ridiculous.  We will oppose the concept of a penalty in general, as well as the amount, which seems very arbitrary.  We are also requesting, in a separate proceeding, a moratorium on tariff filings by MISO until the Midwest RTO process has progressed sufficiently to allow meaningful consideration of the tariff.
I am not sure who is doing the writing but we'll run a draft by you.

Subject:	MISO proposed tariff change

On October 15, 2001, the Midwest ISO filed an amendment to 
Section 17.5 of its Open Access Transmission Tariff to charge 
a fee for non-confirmed transmission service requests for 
transmission service greater than one week. Midwest ISO 
has requested an effective date December 15, 2001.
Interventions and protests are due November 5.

Let me know if you need further information.

"FW: I like this one, well said","Berkeley, California bans U.S. Flags from being displayed on city fire
trucks because they didn't want to offend anyone in the  community.

In an ""act of tolerance"" the head of the public  library at Florida Gulf
Coast University ordered all ""Proud to be an  American"" signs removed so as
to not offend international students.

I, for one, am quite disturbed by these actions of  so-called American
citizens; and I am tired of this nation worrying  about whether or not we
are offending some individual or their culture.  Since the terrorist
attacks on September 11, we have experienced a surge  in patriotism by the
majority of Americans. However, the dust from the attacks had barely
settled in New York and Washington D.C. when the  ""politically correct""
crowd began complaining about the possibility that  our patriotism was
offending others.

I am not against immigration, nor do I hold a grudge against anyone who is
seeking a  better life by coming to America. In fact, our country's
population is  almost entirely comprised of descendants of immigrants;
however, there  are a few things that those who have recently come to our
country, and  apparently some native Americans, need to understand.

First of  all, it is not our responsibility to continually try not to
offend you  in any way. This idea of America being a multi-cultural
community has  served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national
identity. As  Americans, we have our own culture, our own society, our own
language,  and our own lifestyle. This culture, called the ""American Way""
has been  developed over centuries of struggles, trials, and victories by
millions  of men and women who have sought freedom. Our forefathers fought,
bled,  and died at places such as Bunker Hill, Antietam, San Juan, Iwo
Jima,  Normandy, Korea, Vietnam.

We speak English, not Spanish, Arabic,  Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any
other language. Therefore, if you  wish to become part of our society --
learn our language!

""In  God We Trust"" is our national motto. This is not some off-the-wall,
Christian, Right Wing, political slogan -- it is our national motto. It is
engraved in stone in the House of Representatives in our Capitol and it is
printed on our currency. We adopted this motto because Christian  men and
women, on Christian principles, founded this nation; and this is  clearly
documented throughout our history. If it is appropriate  for our motto to
be inscribed in the halls of our highest level of  Government, then it is
certainly appropriate to display it on the walls  of our schools.

God is in our pledge, our National Anthem,  nearly every patriotic song,
and in our founding documents. We honor His  birth, death, and resurrection
as holidays, and we turn to Him in prayer  in times of crisis. If God
offends you, then I suggest you consider  another part of the world as your
new home, because God is part of our  culture and we are proud to have Him.

We are proud of our heritage and those who have so honorably defended our
freedoms. We celebrate Independence Day, Memorial Day, Veterans Day, and
Flag Day. We  have parades, picnics, and barbecues where we proudly wave
our flag.  As an American, I have the right to wave my flag, sing my
national  anthem, quote my national motto, and cite my pledge whenever and
wherever I
choose. If the Stars and Stripes offend you, or you don't  like Uncle Sam,
then you should seriously consider a move to another  part of this planet.

The American culture is our way of life,  our heritage, and we are proud of
it. We are happy with our culture and  have no desire to change, and we
really don't care how you did things  where you came from. We are
Americans, like it or not, this is our  country, our land, and our lifestyle.

Our First Amendment gives every citizen the right to express his opinion
about our government, culture, or society, and we will allow you every
opportunity to do so. But once you are done complaining, whining, and
griping about our flag, our pledge, our national motto, or our way of life,
I highly  encourage you take advantage of one other great American freedom,
the  right to leave.

Barry Loudermilk
If you agree, pass this  onto other Americans!!
It is time to take a  stand!!

Subject:	FW: Move Related Issues



As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen bounding
around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
Thursday.
A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was not
clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday afternoon,''
said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also covers
suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons ``are
deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne, the
family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He will
be truly missed.''
Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White House
as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House in
January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton

Feudalism - You have two cows. Your lord takes some of  the milk.  
Fascism - You have two cows. The  government takes both, hires
you to take care of them, and sells you the  milk.  
Communism - You have two cows. Your  neighbors help take care
of them and you share the  milk.  
Totalitarianism - You have two cows.  The government takes
them both and denies they ever existed and drafts you  into the
army. Milk is banned.  
Capitalism -  You have two cows. You sell one and buy a
bull. Your herd multiplies, and the  economy grows. You sell them
and retire on the  income.  
Enron Venture Capitalism - You have  two cows. You sell
three of them to your publicly listed company, using  letters of
credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute  
debt/equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get
all  four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows. The milk
rights of the  six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a
Cayman Island company  secretly owned by the majority shareholder
who sells the rights to all seven  cows back to your listed
company. The annual report says the company owns  eight cows, with
an option on one more.

"Howdy from Don Baughman","Bad-dream Shotwell,

I got your e-mail address from Andrea Korth Walters the other day.  I tried to get a hold of you earlier in the year, to no avail.  Just wanted to catch up, and go drink a beer and eat a cheeseburger.  

Doing fine down here in Houston.  I bought a house in League City.  In addition, I asked Shannon to marry me but that fell through during the summer.  We are trying to see if we can salvage any of the relationship.  I am doing well at Enron, managing the real-time power trading desk and trading.  Enron, as you have seen in the paper, is experiencing some trouble.  We are reasonably sure we will merge with Dynegy in mid to late 2002.  Family is doing well; my sister is about to have her second baby.  Travis is back from his year and a half tour in Europe, and took a position with Cemex as an account manager.  Dad is about 3/4 retired and he and mom are doing a fair amount of hunting & fishing.  Travis & I are gonna spend Thanksgiving in West Texas, deer hunting.  

How's life in Hooterville?  I heard that you are full on retired! FANTASTIC!  What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?  Hopefully consuming large quantities of beer & tequila and blowing you eardrums out with Jimmy Buffett!

Tell when you are not busy and I will drive up, or have you down to the house and the bayhouse.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Drop me a line when you have a chance!

I have been on vacation since the middle of last week.  I have now received your multiple emails and vmails.  As you are well aware Enron is dealing with a multitude of challenges at the current time.  I appreciate your and Miles' patience regarding the possibility of Enron creating and trading a TradersNews Cinergy product on EOL.  We are currently still evaluating the TradersNews historical data and market conditions pertaining to the viability of such a product.  I will contact you as soon as I am able to move forward with this project on this side.  The best way to reach me is currently via e-mail.

Enron Executives Blamed For Missing Employee Donut Fund
HOUSTON- The Enron Corp. scandal widened Monday, when The Houston
Chronicle reported that top company executives stole nearly $10 from the
employee donut fund sometime between June and August of last year.
""There should be at least $9.25 in the coffee can next to the filters,""
said Laurie Baker, a recently laid-off Enron employee. ""I personally put
$2.50 into that fund, and now it's gone."" Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is
already under grand-jury subpoena regarding $45 in Chinese-food-delivery
allocations that mysteriously vanished on Nov. 17, 2001.

We are about to transition to UBS Warburg, hopefully next week.  The whole thing is a pain in the ass, but, I think that it will have very lucrative returns in the future!


So what's been goin' on?  You never returned my call last week.  How's the B&B project?  I heard supper with R & S & R & M went well, except for you having some G.I. problems.  Drop me a line or call if you want to catch a movie or grab  supper some time.

Three interesting things.

2.  The Rodeo Kickoff dance is going on next  Wednesday the 16th.  You and Travis are invited to come with me if ya'll  would like.  Or meet me somewhere in the area.  It starts at 7:30 or  something like that.
 
3.  On Friday night some of us are going to  the Firehouse to celebrate Barbara Prukop's 35th birthday.  Ya'll are  invited to that also.
 
So let me know something about joining us for any  of the above social events.

   Clinton's Beloved Dog Buddy Killed by Car
   NEW YORK (Reuters) - Buddy, the chocolate retriever once seen
bounding
   around the White House gardens with Bill Clinton, was killed by a car
   near the former president's home in Chappaqua, N.Y., police said
   Thursday.
   A police officer said the dog was hit Wednesday afternoon but it was
not
   clear whether it was being walked at the time or had wandered off the
   property owned by Clinton and his wife, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton
   ``His dog was hit by a car ... we received a call yesterday
afternoon,''
   said Sgt. Charles Ferry of the New Castle, N.Y., police that also
covers
   suburban Chappaqua in Westchester County north of New York City.
   The former president's spokeswoman Julia Payne said the Clintons
``are
   deeply saddened by Buddy's death.'' In a statement issued by Payne,
the
   family said, ``He was a loyal companion and brought us much joy. He
will
   be truly missed.''
   Payne said Buddy was 4-1/2 years old and was taken into the White
House
   as Clinton's pet soon after he was born. Clinton left the White House
in
   January 2001 after serving two four-year terms. Hillary Clinton
