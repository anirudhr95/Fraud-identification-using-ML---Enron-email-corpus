"New Stock Symbol","
Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

"","Hi Don,

Just wanted to get this out to you in the hope that you havent worked on January's and this month's schedule. I had already planned to be in Denver to ski (know any good resorts?) and then spend the new year with my family..earlier the plan was to do this from the26th onwards..as scheduled, but since we might not get our vacation from Enron at all.. I was wondering if everything being exegient, I could take off a little early and arrive into say the 4th or so of Jan?

This of course being that I dont upset too many other schedules and no news occurs upon us which would preclude this.

Also on an unrelated note..the people from Trader News called and wanted prices,...but I have not sent them anything not knowing our legal position on the same.


See you in a bit.


Regards,


Punit.

"Access to EPA systems - OATS and ETS","Hello ATW User Group!

OATS WILL BE UNAVAILABLE DECEMBER 29

Below is a message that was sent out by Alex Salpter of the EPA this
morning.  The scheduled shut down of the OATS system should be planned on so
that you don't find yourself in a last minute attempt to transfer allowances
online and not be allowed.  As mentioned below, this especially affects NOx
compliance since December 31, 2001 is the last day to transfer allowances in
NATS.  Please review and prepare.

Best Regards,
Ona Papageorgiou
ESP

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dear Clients of the On-Line Allowance Transfer System (OATS):

This to to let you know that the National Computer Center (NCC) at Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina, will be moving its location and will be shut
down between Saturday, December 29 and Monday, December 31, as follows:

-- OATS will be unavailable on Saturday, December 29.

-- The mainframe, used for submission of quarterly emission reports, will
not be available from Saturday, December 29 through Monday, December 31.

OATS should be back in operation by Monday, December 31 and the mainframe
should be back in operation by Tuesday, January 1. There is a (small)
possibility that problems may arise and delay availability.

This is especially important to Authorized Account Representatives of
accounts in the NOx Allowance Tracking System (NATS), since December 31 is
the NOx Budget Program (NBP) allowance transfer deadline. December 31 is the
last day that a transfer of allowances, of 1999 through 2001 vintage, can be
recorded via the On-Line Allowance Transfer System (OATS). It is also the
last day for mailing a hardcopy Allowance Transfer form for NBP 2001 Annual
Reconciliation purposes.

Please do not wait until the last minute to do on-line allowance transfers!!
Should any problem arise in accessing OATS, please make sure to mail a
hardcopy NBP Allowance Transfer form by midnight, December 31.

Dear Investor,

I know you're frustrated by the lousy market over the past 18 months.
But I warn you...

...now is not the time to start taking big risks in hope of making up
for lost time.  You'll just end up in a bigger hole. And frankly, it
just isn't necessary to take chances to achieve great profits.  There is
a much better, time-tested way.

YOU CAN become an ""Armadillo Investor.""

The armadillo is nature's perfect survivor.  A thick plate of armor.
Sharp claws.  And a clear focus on the hunt.  Armadillo Investors build
profits aggressively -- but we also use proven techniques to protect
against the losses most investors inevitably suffer.  Our mantra: ""Win
at investing by never losing.""

I don't take big risks when hunting for oversized profits.  I simply
follow the armadillo strategy that has made me wealthy -- and made
thousands of investors who've followed my advice quite wealthy, as well.
 Here's just one example of an Armadillo stock we're recommending today
-- I think you'll see why it's the kind of investment EVERY investor
should own.

This company has achieved 31 consecutive years of revenue growth!  It's
gained 72% for us so far this year.  That sounds like heaven, compared
to the hell most investors have been sliding through.

I came upon this story in an afternoon of serendipity.  Debbie and I
were out riding our Harleys on a beautiful fall day when we passed an
impressive-sized store in South Deerfield, Massachusetts.  While that's
not exactly the middle-of-nowhere, it's close.  And the huge parking lot
was JAMMED with hundreds of cars.

At first, I thought it must be a mall.  Curiosity got the best of us, so
we stopped for a peek.  No mall.  Just a single store, selling just one
product line, with folks lined up at the registers ten-deep!  Okay, this
was something worth checking out, so I put my research team on it.

It turns out that this store is the second most-visited tourist
destination in Massachusetts.  And it's the front for one of the
most-amazing little companies I've ever run across -- devoted followers,
fat profit margins and some heavy hitters behind the scenes.  Directors
include Hollywood deal man Michael Ovitz, the president of Staples and
the chairman of J. Crew.  This is just a neat story that can make you a
lot of money.

I outline the best ways to profit from this Armadillo and 4 more in my
new FREE report: ARMADILLO STOCKS: 5 INVESTMENTS THAT WIN BY NEVER
LOSING. This new report is yours absolutely FREE for the asking.
Nothing to buy.  Nothing to try.  No cost.  No commitment.  No kidding.

Just read it and profit.

Why am I giving this report away FREE?  Because it's the best way I know
to introduce you to my advisory service.

Each month in INTELLIGENCE REPORT we outline the profit champions of
tomorrow.  We call them ""armadillo stocks"" because they have sharp claws
to rake in fat profits and a hard shell for protection from competitors
and recession.

Simply read this new free special report to learn all about 5 Armadillo
Stocks that will weather any storm.

All,

Here is the schedule for TDS databases on Netco: (as confirmed by Diana Allen)

TDSP	:	Will be a copy from esttdsp as of Thursday, January 17 2002 at 4:00pm (the day before Netco goes live on Friday)
TDST	:	Will be a copy from tds8itst. As requested, whenever the Netco production migration is completed, this will be refreshed from tape as of prior Dec 19 2001. 
TDSD	:	Will be a copy from tds8idev. I have moved this database into a netco server.  As soon as Clement pushed the tnsnames.ora change, you will be able to connect to TDSD


Please let me know if you have question or modification.

Tantra.

Subject: one of the all-time best comeback lines ever
Regardless of how you feel about gun laws, you have to love this  one!  On the radio the other day, there was one of the all-time best  comeback  lines ever.   [Note: This is an exact replication of  National Public Radio (NPR) interview  between a female broadcaster and  US Army General Reinwald who was about to  sponsor a Boy Scout Troop  visiting his military installation.]   FEMALE INTERVIEWER: So,  General Reinwald, what things are you going to  teach these young boys  when they visit your base?  GENERAL REINWALD: We're going to teach them  climbing, canoeing,  archery and shooting.   FEMALE INTERVIEWER:  Shooting! That's a bit irresponsible, isn't it?  GENERAL REINWALD: I  don't see why. They'll be properly supervised on  the rifle range.    FEMALE INTERVIEWER: Don't you admit that this is a terribly  dangerous  activity to be teaching children?  GENERAL REINWALD: I  don't see how. We will be teaching the proper  rifle discipline before  they even touch a firearm.   FEMALE INTERVIEWER: But you're  equipping them to become violent  killers.  GENERAL REINWALD: Well,  you're equipped to be a prostitute, but you're  not one, are you?    The radio went silent and the interview ended.  Go Army!

      <p>Dear Don,</p>
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Don Baughman"" <don.baughman@enron.com>, who belongs to list
enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->

<p>The <b>General Accounting Office</b> made it official on Wednesday -
the investigative arm of Congress will <b>sue Vice President Dick
Cheney</b> over his <b>refusal to turn over information</b> related to
the work of his <b>energy task force</b>.  The GAO wants to know with
whom the task force met, especially within the energy industry.  The
<b>White House insists the request is inappropriate</b> and promises to
put up a fight.  On Thursday from the Washington bureau, we'll hear
where this dispute is headed.
<p>The Washington bureau will also have the latest on the Congressional
investigation into Enron.  Several new <b>Enron hearings</b> have been
added to next week's Congressional calendar.  <b>Two big hearings</b>
are scheduled for Monday and former <b>Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is expected
to make an appearance at both</b>.  This will be the <b>first time any
Enron executive has testified before Congress</b>.
<p>West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas will speak one-on-one
with <b>Southern California Edison President Bob Foster</b> Thursday.
He'll discuss <b>SoCal Edison's road to recovery</b> during 1:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p>On Thursday from Houston, <b>Haynes and Boone LLP Attorney Lenny
Parkins</b> will join us to <b>provide legal analysis on the latest
Enron developments</b>.  Parkins is stopping by the bureau during the
noon ET newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>Energy Intelligence Group Bureau Chief Barbara Shook talks about
LNG projects</b>.  Some of the <b>projects that were scheduled to come
online in the U.S.</b> are now being <b>placed on the back burner due to
low gas prices</b>.  Catch Shook from the Houston bureau on Thursday.
<p>Finally from the NASDAQ in New York, <b>Tyumen Oil Company President
and CEO Simon Kukes</b> will join us.  He'll give us the <b>lowdown on
Russian oil issues</b> at 9:00 a.m. ET on Thursday.

"Employee Meeting Postponed","We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

Subject:	The Senior Citizen and the State Trooper


Hit you all with a funny early this morning! Holla


The Senior Citizen and the State Trooper
There was a middle aged guy who bought a brand new Mercedes Convertible SLK.
He took off down the road, flooring it up to 80 mph and enjoying the wind
blowing through what little hair he had left on his head.
""This is great,"" he thought and floored it some more. He looked in
his
rearview mirror and there was a Florida Highway Patrol Trooper behind
him,
bullfights flashing and siren blasting. ""I can get away from him with no
problem,"" thought the man and he floored it some more and flew down the
road
at over 100 mph. Then he thought, ""What am I doing? I'm too old for this
kind of thing"" and pulled over to the side of the road and waited for the
State Trooper to catch up with him.  The Trooper pulled in behind the
Mercedes and walked up to the man.  ""Sir,"" he said, looking at his watch.
""My shift ends in 30 minutes and today is Friday the 13th. If you can give
me a reason why you were speeding that I've never heard before, I'll let you
go.""
The man looked at the Trooper and said, ""Last week my wife ran off with a
State Trooper, and I thought you were bringing her back."" The State Trooper
said, ""Have a nice day.""

"The World Mourns...","Wendy's Founder Dave Thomas Dies
By MARK WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Dave Thomas, the portly pitchman whose homespun
ads built Wendy's Old-Fashioned Hamburgers into one of the world's most
successful fast-food enterprises, has died. He was 69.
Thomas died around midnight at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., the
company said Tuesday.
The cause of death was not given. Thomas had been undergoing kidney
dialysis since early 2001 and had quadruple heart bypass surgery in
December 1996.
Company officials were meeting at Wendy's headquarters in the Columbus
suburb of Dublin and planned an announcement later Tuesday.
The founder and senior chairman of Wendy's International became a
household name when he began pitching his burgers and fries in
television commercials in 1989. The smiling Thomas, always wearing a
white short-sleeved shirt and red tie, touted the virtues of fast-food
in humorous ads, sometimes featuring stars such as bluesman B.B. King
and soap opera queen Susan Lucci.
``As long as it works, I'll continue to do the commercials,'' Thomas
said in a 1991 interview. ``When it's not working any longer, then I'm
history.''
But burgers weren't his first love. Thomas, who was adopted as an
infant, became a national advocate for adoption.
He created the Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, a not-for-profit
organization focused on raising public awareness of adoption. The
profits from his books, ``Dave's Way'' and ``Well Done!'' go to the
foundation.
He once testified before a Congressional committee about the importance
of creating incentives for adoption.
``I know firsthand how important it is for every child to have a home
and loving family,'' he testified. ``Without a family, I would not be
where I am today.''
Born July 2, 1932, Thomas was 12 when he got his first job - delivering
groceries in Knoxville, Tenn. He joined the restaurant business in the
1950s.
While working at a barbecue restaurant in Fort Wayne, Ind., he met KFC
founder Col. Harland Sanders, who became a major influence.
Thomas came to Columbus in 1962 to take over four failing KFC
restaurants for his boss, who promised Thomas a 45 percent stake in them
if he turned them around. Sanders sold the restaurants back to KFC for
$1.5 million in 1968, making Thomas a millionaire at 35.
He opened his first Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers in Columbus a year
later. He named the restaurant after his 8-year-old daughter Melinda
Lou, nicknamed Wendy by her siblings.
The chain grew to 4,800 restaurants in the United States and 34
countries by 1996. That year, Wendy's acquired the 1,200-store,
Canadian-based Tim Hortons chain of coffee and fresh-baked goods.
Thomas was a forgiving businessman.
The city of Philadelphia in 1994 wanted to fine Wendy's $98,400,
claiming the restaurant was selling quarter-pounders that were up to a
quarter of an ounce short. The city later announced it made an error and
withdrew the fine.
``I understand what happened,'' said Thomas, who visited the city
shortly after the controversy. ``Things happen. Mistakes happen. As far
as we're concerned, we just want to go to the future. A bright future.''

He tried to retire in 1982, but came back in 1989.
``They took the focus off the consumer,'' he said of the executives who
took over the company.
It was the TV commercials that made Thomas famous. Industry analysts and
company officials said the ads helped the company rebound from a
difficult period in the mid-1980s when earnings sank. In 1996, Thomas
taped his 500th commercial. Rotund at first, he appeared slimmer in the
ads in recent years.
``He's given Wendy's a corporate identity ... a down-homey type image.
The lack of sophistication is a real benefit for the company,'' Diane
Mustain, a financial analyst, said in 1991.
Despite his success, it wasn't until 1993 that he earned a high school
equivalency certificate.
That year, he told 2,500 Columbus public school seniors his biggest
mistake was not finishing high school.
``We have 4,000 restaurants today, but if I had gotten my high school
diploma, we might have 8,000,'' he said.

Darwin Award: COP CAP

August 2001, Missouri | When the Pierce City Chief of Police reached
into his trunk and pulled out his shotgun, he should have remembered
to point the gun aside. But even the best-trained men make mistakes.
His ""quick draw"" precipitated a fatal self-shooting when the trigger
caught on a loop of fabric, and he accidentally peppered himself with
bullets.

--------------------------------------------+---+-+---+-+-+-+-+

Darwin Award: SLOW LEARNER

Two reminders to fasten your seatbelt before risking your life.

March 2001, Virginia | Brandon, 21, was driving to the courthouse to
face charges of reckless driving, speeding, driving without a license,
and failure to wear seat belts, when he lost control of his speeding
vehicle. The Hyundai crossed the median of Interstate 64 and collided
with a truck pulling a flatbed trailer carrying three cars. As luck
would have it, Brandon had again chosen not to wear his seatbelt.
He was ejected from the car, and died at the scene.

March 2001, North Carolina | Justin's tale is more complicated, but
his fate is equally apt. A failure to wear his seatbelt led him to
18 days in a coma, after he crashed his car at 90 miles per hour and
was ejected from a window. But that was only the first of his mistakes.
One year later, Justin was riding with a friend, again sans seatbelt,
when the speeding vehicle careened off the pavement. Once again
he was involuntarily ejected from the window, only this time
he was killed on impact.

Darwin Award: THIRST FOR DEATH

January 2001, New Zealand | The west coast of New Zealand is threaded
with narrow, windy roads that climb and descend the hills at improbable
angles. A Christchurch driver with little patience for those dangerous
curves was preparing a hot cup of tea in her car when she learned one
last lesson about respect for the road.

Nothing, but nothing, could keep her from her afternoon tea that day.
Well all right, one thing could keep her from her tea. Karma. While
she was trying to brew a cuppa, her car plunged over a precipice and
into a creek. The woman was found dead three days later, still holding
a box of teabags, with a mug wedged against the steering wheel and
a thermos of hot water beneath her feet.

There were no brake marks on the road.

Honorable Mention: SHELL NECKLACE

March 2001, Washington | A 19-year-old Spokane man damaged his hand
while attempting to string a necklace of live ammunition. He was
punching holes in the shell casings using an awl and hammer, when
one of the projectiles exploded in his hands. Perhaps he should have
collected the shells from the beach, instead of the artillery range.

Personal Account: THEORETICAL KNOWLEDGE (Thanks Alex!)

April 1998, Canada | Some people talk smart but act like future
Darwin Award winners. I had just emerged from my high school chemistry
class, not my best subject. On my way to the cafeteria, I was joined by
Mr. Junior Einstein, who was happily spouting chemical gibberish. He
began pontificating on the reactions caused by adding heat to certain
elements such as neon and aluminum. Once we reached the cafeteria, he
nonchalantly placed his food in the microwave oven. As it cooked, Einstein
explained that aluminum can explode when heated sufficiently. As he
talked,
I began to detect the faint scent of smoke in the air, which I mentioned
to my guest lecturer. As we turned towards the microwave, his jaw dropped
low enough to accommodate a rack of test tubes. His dish of food was
blazing. One second later the oven was rocked by a loud Kablaam! This
candidate for an Honorable Mention suddenly discovered that theoretical
knowledge does not equal practical wisdom. The chemistry lesson he learned
in the cafeteria was far more valuable: ""Don't mix aluminum foil with
heat!""

Take 2 minutes to read this.it's worth it!

Sounds like a Darwin award:

 Two hunters from Michigan--(true story) This is from a radio program,
> a true report of an incident in Michigan:
>
> A guy buys a brand new Lincoln Navigator for $42,500 and has $560
> monthly payments. He and a friend go duck hunting in winter, and of
> course all the lakes are frozen. These two guys go out on the lake
with
> the guns, the dog, and the new vehicle.
>
> They drive out onto the lake ice and get ready. Now, they want to
> make some kind of a natural landing area for the ducks, something for
> the decoys to float on. In order to make a hole large enough to look
> like something a wandering duck would fly down and land on, it is
> going to take a little more effort than an ice hole drill.
>
> So, out of the back of the new Navigator comes a stick of dynamite
> with a short, 40-second fuse. Now these two Rocket Scientists do
> take into consideration that they want to place the stick of dynamite
> on the ice at a location far from where they are standing (and the
new

> Navigator), because they don't want to take the risk of slipping on
the
> ice when they run from the burning fuse and possibly go up in smoke
> with the resulting blast.
>
> They light the 40-second fuse and throw the dynamite. Remember a
> couple of paragraphs back when I mentioned the vehicle, the guns and
> the dog? Let's talk about the dog: A highly trained Black Lab used
for

> RETRIEVING. Especially things thrown by the owner. You guessed
> it, the dog takes off at a high rate of doggy speed on the ice and
cap-
> tures the stick of dynamite with the burning 40-second fuse about the
> time it hits the ice.
>
> The two men yell, scream, wave their arms and wonder what to do
> now. The dog, cheered on, keeps coming. One of the guys grabs the
> shotgun and shoots the dog. The shotgun is loaded with # 8 buckshot,
> hardly big enough to stop a Black Lab. The dog stops for a moment,
> slightly confused, but continues on. Another shot and this time the
dog,
> still standing, becomes really confused and of course terrified,
thinking
> these two geniuses have gone insane.
>
> The dog takes off to find cover, under the brand new Navigator.
> ----BOOM!---- Dog and Navigator are blown to bits and sink to
> the bottom of the lake in a very large hole, leaving the two idiots
standing there with this ""I can't believe this happened"" look on their
faces.
>
> The insurance company says that sinking a vehicle in a lake by
illegal
> use of explosives is not covered. He still had yet to make the first
of those $560 a month payments!
>
> And you thought your day was not going well!!

"FLASH ALERT: Don't fall for Technology's biggest LIE...","Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  I'll send it to you free when you
accept a FREE 60 day trial to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

That's right -- take a full 60 days to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  This free 60 day trial means my advisory
costs you nothing if you're not 100% satisfied with the
advice you receive.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic
is DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this free 60 day trial now.

"The Case AGAINST Tech Stocks","Dear Investor,

People know me as a ""diehard"" technology investor.  So
it's sure to surprise many of them when I say:

Most investors WON'T make a dime this year in
technology stocks.

That's because the old game is over.  No more buying
frenzy.  No return to the anything-works days of 1999.
And no easy-pickings.

That's the BAD NEWS.

The GOOD NEWS?  We're already enjoying a new feast of
profits that can make you 75%-to-100% RICHER by this
time next year.  But most investors -- sadly --will
miss out.

That's because the technology ""boom"" has passed its
revolutionary stage...and turned into an EVOLUTIONARY
process that will give most companies fits.  Good
ideas and innovation are no longer enough.  Execution,
size and financial strength matter MUCH more today.

A ton more ""great"" companies with ""great"" technologies
and ""great"" people will badly disappoint Wall Street
in the coming months.  And any investor using the OLD
rules for investing in tech stocks will get creamed!

YOU CAN SEE it in the old-time tech giants like
Hewlett-Packard and Ericsson that are uncompetitive
today.  You can see it in not-for-profit business
model of Amazon.com.  And you can see it in all the
little gee-whiz technology companies that have tumbled
like bowling pins on league night.

In my view, ""betting on tech stocks"" today is like a
trip to Vegas without any of the fun.  But -- and
here's the good part -- you can still MAKE YOUR
FORTUNE by investing in those few powerhouses that
still lord above the rest in this incredibly
competitive industry.

In fact, since the beginning of October my entire
POWERHOUSE portfolio (that's every single stock I
recommend, not some made-up ""best of"" list) is UP 40%.
How about you?  Are you making money like this --
right now -- or are you missing out???

Take a look at some of the stocks my clients and I own
-- and how well they're doing RIGHT NOW:

*I'm sure by now you've heard of Amgen's buyout of the
fast-growing biotech firm Immunex.  When that deal was
announced, it included a 17% premium.  But we've done
much better.  In fact, we just sold for banked 105%
GAINS in just 8-months' time.

*Analysts are jumping back on the cell phone
bandwagon.  Why?  New personal security issues;
soaring sales in China; and a generational shift in
technologies.  Powerhouse Nokia is UP 44% since in
October 1st.

*We're seeing a major shift in how microchips are
manufactured, thanks to the next generation of
technological innovations.  And that means big profits
for the top contract manufacturers like Taiwan
Semiconductor.  We're UP 91% over the same timeframe.

*Of course, security is a HUGE issue now.  And many of
the answers that will make our lives and businesses
more secure are technology-based.  Security POWERHOUSE
Check Point Systems is UP 76%.

*What's more, we're making money in nearly every tech
sector, thanks to our laser-like selectivity.  Even
the beleaguered enterprise software sector has been
good to us -- since the beginning of October, our
stake in Peoplesoft has SOARED 116%!

As you can see, we've made a TON of money already.
And so, you might ask, ""Is it TOO LATE for me?""

No.  In fact, you can match these profits in the
coming months -- even beat them; but there is ONE
CATCH.  You must act now.

YOU CAN'T afford to disregard my invitation to join
Technology Investing any longer.  As our recent gains
prove, we are in the midst of a POTENT profit run that
can make you a small fortune in 2002.  But not if you
just sit on your hands.

Several of our stocks that have made huge moves
already still have much further to run.  Join me at
Technology Investing, and I'll tell you which ones --
and why.  Other stocks that have done little so far
are on the verge of rallies that could easily DOUBLE
your money from here.

That's because all tech sectors WON'T come back at
once.  In fact, some won't come back at all.  I'll
help you avoid those many stocks destined to go
nowhere in 2002.  We'll simply move from wave to wave
of profits -- for fun that lasts the entire blessed
year -- instead.

So please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-
time if you miss out. Get my TOP current wealth-
builders now, by accepting a 100% RISK-FREE trial
subscription to my Technology Investing advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can BANK 75%-to-100% gains this year alone
in the top technology stocks.

So take a look at Technology Investing to see what you
think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
Technology Investing

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  Since October 1st, our entire holdings -- not
cherry-picked, the complete list -- are UP 40%.

And back in 1999 -- after the last big stock market
panic -- we saw what most folks were missing and piled
into select tech stocks for 157% GAINS, as verified by
The Hulbert Financial Digest.  That's without risking
a dime on the dot-com craze!  While I'm not looking
for an exact repeat performance in 2002, I do expect
to earn 75%-to-100% PROFITS in my top tech stocks.
Unfortunately, most investors will just miss out
again.

Don't you miss out.  Go here now:

Subject:	PLEASE READ: ECS Power Outage this weekend
Importance:	High

Please be aware that there is a scheduled power outage in ECS this weekend on Saturday, January 19, 2002. The outage is scheduled from 2:00pm - 4:00 pm. 

There should be no impact with the exception of a loss of power to the plasma screens.

 In order to protect the plasma screens from becoming damaged during the power shutdown, technical support will need your assistance in turning off all plasmas in your area this Friday at close of business. Desktop Support technicians will assist with turning back on the plasmas on Tuesday morning, January 22, 2002 starting at 6:00 am (as Monday is a holiday).

I am sending this to the admins in ECS. Please forward to anyone I may have missed and please assist us in spreading the word to anyone who may be working on Saturday. Again, the only impact will be the loss of the plasma screens.

Thank you for your assistance in advance! Please call me if you have any questions/concerns

"URGENT BULLETIN: Don't Make This Mistake...","Dear Investor,

I know ""hope springs eternal,"" but please don't let
it blind you to what's really going on.

Tech stocks have staged a very impressive rally since
October 1st.  So we're out of the woods, right?  We're
on our way to a new bull market, right?  And
everything is well in technology land, right?

WRONG!

And if you make the same mistake I see many investors
making -- and jump back in tech stocks like it's 1999
all over again -- you will likely lose your shirt.

YOU SEE, much of the rise in tech stocks is attributable
to ""short covering"" -- and it won't continue with the
breadth and power folks are dreaming of.  Why?  Because
the entire tech sector still has an erratic and
unpredictable earnings outlook.

To simplify it even further, earnings for most tech
companies STINK!

Tech companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning
in red ink.  And most won't have positive earnings news
for the next 7-to-10 months.  That's why most tech
stocks -- while they've popped off their lows -- offer
much greater risk than potential reward for the foreseeable
future.

IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn handsome
profits you can take to the bank -- you must invest in
those companies I call ""EARNINGS MONSTERS.""

That's the term I use for companies bucking the current
trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from
30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn
anything at all.  These ""EARNINGS MONSTERS"" are the only
sort of stocks we own at my Blue Chip Growth Advisory.
And they're the only stocks that YOU should even think
of owning now.

I've written to you several times about out ""Earnings
Monsters"" over the last few months.  And I'm sorry you
haven't yet joined my roster of Blue Chip Growth clients
because you're MISSING OUT:

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we own
at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just strong
earnings growth.  It's already UP 103% for the year!

*PeopleSoft is one of the few tech stocks I own today.
Why?  Solid 30%+ earnings growth so far in 2001.  In fact,
3rd quarter profits ""beat the street"" by 25%.  The result?
The stock is UP 97% since October 1st.

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in times
like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually recession-proof
business.  It's up a nice, stomach-calming 36% YTD.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is hogging
all the profits.  The company announced chart-topping
earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and its stock is UP
20% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED 251%
since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because it's one of
very few tech stocks that's still an EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the EARNINGS
MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late 1997,
our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-to-1, thanks
to our commitment to earnings quality.  And the advisory I
started in the mid-1980's, MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in
the last 16 years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a company
keeps performing, I love it...things start looking iffy, I
take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We SOLD
Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209% gains overall
from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in Microsoft; 179% in
Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 320% in Dell Computer; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  All stocks we SOLD
last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's why I
urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip Growth.  It's
simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR PROFITS -- in any kind of
market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-FREE.
You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a dime.  I'll give
you six months to try the service risk-free -- set the bar
as high as you want.  Sign up now.  I'll introduce you to
the EARNINGS MONSTERS that are your best bet for 50%
gains -- or more -- over the next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. Overall, insider buying is the strongest it has been in
years.  That's great news -- but not for tech stocks.  In
fact, many tech insiders are SELLING to raise money for taxes
they owe on options conversions last year.  That'll just knock
many tech stocks for a loop again.  So stay away!  Buy our
EARNINGS MONSTERS instead.  Click here now:

"FLASH ALERT: Don't fall for Technology's biggest LIE...","Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Best of the Web Today - December 13, 2001
By JAMES TARANTO
The Osama Video  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20011213/ts/afghan_bin_laden_tape.html

The Pentagon has released the video of Osama bin Laden, found at a house in Jalalabad; the  transcript  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/tape.transcript/  is here and "" Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?  http://www.cnn.com/2001/US/12/13/ret.bin.laden.quotes/index.html

USA Today reports U.S. officials are disputing yesterday's  Christian Science Monitor  http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/1213/p1s1-wosc.html  report that bin Laden has fled to Pakistan. ""I'm sure he's there,"" one defense official tells USA Today, referring to the Tora Bora cave hideout. ""If there was any indication that he wasn't there, we'd know."" The Monitor's source was Abu Jaffar, a ""senior al Qaeda operative and Saudi financier,"" who is still in Afghanistan, in a ""village still sympathetic to Mr. bin Laden and his fighters.""  Reuters  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011213/ts/attack_afghan_binladen_dc_9.html  reports Pakistan also denies the Monitor report.

The  Times of London  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001560016-2001573974,00.html%20 , however, reports that ""the last remnants"" of al Qaeda's military force ""were trickling across the border into Pakistan yesterday after the death or capture of more than half their fighters. . . . Once in Pakistan, individuals are likely to try to flee to third countries, such as Somalia, Yemen or Sudan, where al-Qaeda has strong support."" The  Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/13/wbinx13.xml&sSheet=/portal/2001/12/13/ixport.html  reports that ""the US navy is scouring the world's oceans and ports for a fleet of 23 merchant ships owned by Osama bin Laden, fearing that the vessels could be used to help him escape or carry weapons of mass destruction to the West.""

On to Somalia  http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/12/13/wsom13.xml&sSheet=/news/2001/12/13/ixhome.html

The Telegraph reports that Britain has persuaded Kenya to allow American special forces to use bases for a planned attack on al Qaeda operations in Somalia. President Daniel arap Moi fears that a large-scale assault on Somlia would bring a flood of refugees into Kenya, but ""intensive studies of Somalia, where al-Qa'eda terrorists have been able to hide and train in the past, have shown the Pentagon that a broad military campaign as used in Afghanistan would not be necessary to destroy Osama bin Laden's limited network there.""

Talk About Sick  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37022-2001Dec13.html

Thirteen injured Arab fighters have explosives tied to their waists and ""threatening to blow themselves up if anyone other than medical staff entered their rooms"" at a Kandahar hospital, the Associated Press reports. ""They don't allow anybody to see them except just those who are treating them, dressing the wounds or cleaning the rooms,"" says Ghulam Mohammed Afghan, Mirwais Hospital's head nurse. ""They are scared and they don't want to talk about anything. It's extremely difficult for the hospital staff because they or other patients could get injured. It's dangerous.""

How hard can it be to neutralize this problem? Can't the nurses just inject the patients with a tranquilizer?

Jewish Terror Bust  http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-121301jdl.story

Irv Rubin, head of the Jewish Defense League, and Earl Krugel, his West Coast coordinator, are under arrest in Los Angeles, charged with ""conspiracy to destroy a building by means of an explosive"" and ""possession of a destructive device related to a crime of violence."" Rubin and Krugel allegedly planned to blow up the King Fahd Mosque in Culver City, Calif., and an office of Rep. Darrell Issa, a California Republican who is Arab-American. The Los Angeles Times reports:

*** QUOTE ***

The alleged plot, according to an FBI affidavit, was revealed by a JDL member who was first contacted by Rubin and Krugel in October about participating in attacks on local Arab-related institutions. In a subsequent tape-recording of a meeting at Krugel's residence, the affidavit alleges, Krugel said Arabs needed ""a wake-up call"" and Rubin said the JDL needed to draw more attention to itself in a ""militant way.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Watch for the root-cause crowd to come forward with the usual explanations: The poverty and oppression under which L.A. Jews live makes this sort of thing understandable, if not inevitable; they did it as a protest against U.S. foreign policy; their alleged targets need to ask themselves: Why do they hate us? Yeah, we expect to hear this stuff any minute now.

Terror in New Delhi  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/131201/dlnat125.asp

A terrorist attack on India's Parliament has claimed the lives of six cops and a Parliament staffer. Also dead are all six terrorists, who ""set off massive blasts and reportedly used AK-47 rifles, RDX and Chinese-made grenades for the attack,"" according to the Hindustan Times. No word yet on who's behind the attack.

Israel and Arafat  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A36825-2001Dec13.html

In response to the latest Arab terrorist attacks, Israel has severed all contact with Palestinian Authority honcho Yasser Arafat, bombed his headquarters and sent troops into Arab towns. Israel's security cabinet put out a statement saying Arafat was ""directly responsible"" for the latest round of terrorism ""and therefore is no longer relevant to Israel, and Israel will no longer have any connection with him."" Israel's justice minister also says meetings of Israeli and Palestinian security commanders, arranged by U.S. envoy Anthony Zinni, will end.

USA Today  http://usatoday.com/usatonline/20011213/3696554s.htm  notes that ""in the latest attack, a bomb was detonated under a bus outside the Israeli community of Emanuel. Palestinians opened fire on fleeing passengers and shot at rescuers who arrived to treat the injured. One gunman was killed. Taking credit [sic] for the attack was the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, an underground militia affiliated with Arafat's Fatah group. The brigade said it took part in the attack with Hamas, a group opposed to the state of Israel.""

Slate's "" Today's Papers  http://slate.msn.com/?id=2059710 "" column asks: ""If Hamas and Fatah members did indeed work together on the attacks, would it be the first such joint operation between the two groups? Because that would certainly be a notable development.""

White House press secretary  Ari Fleischer  http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011212-8.html  said yesterday that ""it is imperative that Chairman Arafat take every step possible to stop the violence, to stop the attacks. It's hard to imagine how a peace process can be fruitful and take hold if there is no peace, if there's killing""--an obvious point, but such clarity has been lacking in Washington until recently.

Another encouraging sign from the U.S.: The  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2001/12/13/LatestNews/LatestNews.39892.html  reports that ""after a three-year lobbying effort by US Jewish groups and families of Americans who were murdered by Palestinian terrorists, the State Department announced this week that it plans to publicize rewards of up to $5 million for for information leading to the capture of Palestinian killers of US citizens on its ""Rewards for Justice"" website.""

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/13/international/middleeast/13SAUD.html

The New York Times (link requires registration) notes that the government of Saudi Arabia took no note of the three-month anniversary of the Sept. 11 atrocities:

*** QUOTE ***

The only event known to have taken place in the kingdom was a one- minute moment of silence late Tuesday afternoon at the United States Embassy in Riyadh, which no Saudi officials attended. In other Arab countries, including Egypt and Kuwait, government officials attended memorial services sponsored by American embassies.

*** END QUOTE ***

Osama bin Laden grew up in Saudi Arabia, and 15 of the 19 Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudis.

From Hot Tubs to High Treason  http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/nat-gen/2001/dec/12/121208170.html

The Associated Press visits San Anselmo, Calif., hometown of Marin mujahid John Walker. This snippet says it all:

*** QUOTE ***

""I don't think it's a big deal for young people to have weird ideas,"" said Nahshon Nahumi, who repairs hot tubs in the hills above the home of Walker's mother. ""My concern is more for his well-being, to help him recover.""

*** END QUOTE ***

The AP adds that at  Tamiscal High School  http://tamiscal.marin.k12.ca.us/ , Walker's alma mater, ""Principal Marcie Miller said the highly competitive school remains proud of Walker as well as its other students, who tend to be self-directed.""

Meanwhile, the  Adelaide Advertiser  http://www.theadvertiser.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,3424536%255E910,00.html  has identified the Australian bin Ladenite captured by the Northern Alliance. He is David Hicks, alias ""Mohammed Dawood,"" a 26-year-old Muslim convert. His father, Terry Hicks, got a call from David Sept. 28, and son told father he was fighting for the Taliban. Cheers to Terry Hicks for being much more clear-headed than John Walker's parents. ""I think of a terrorist as someone with a bomb strapped to him, but he's a terrorist in our eyes as he's fighting against his own kind,"" the elder Hicks tells the Advertiser. ""I told him what I thought of what he was doing.""

Stupidity Watch  http://www.sacbee.com/state_wire/story/1307113p-1375526c.html

The Berkeley, Calif., City Council ""voted Tuesday night to supply workers who answer the city's general information phones with material about the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors,"" the Associated Press reports. ""The idea is to have information available so staff can refer anyone who calls asking about how to avoid military combat."" The council defeated an amendment that would also have made available information about military recruitment.

Now, you're probably thinking: What's the news here? After all, everyone knows the majority of the Berkeley City Council is unpatriotic. Yes, but we didn't know quite how stupid they were. Didn't it occur to any of them that America has a volunteer military? If you want to avoid military service, you don't need to declare yourself a ""conscientious objector."" Just don't enlist!

She Should Have Walked  http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/36479.htm

We've heard a few stories of people trying to scam insurance companies by falsely claiming loved ones died Sept. 11, but this one takes the cake. The New York Post reports Jihad Razzaq has been indicted in New Orleans. The indictment says Razzaq ""tried to cash in his wife's $100,000 life-insurance policy when in fact she had left the United States for her native Jordan"":

*** QUOTE ***

The 54-year-old man apparently told New York Life that his wife was shopping at the World Trade Center site when the buildings crumbled.

Red flags were raised when he said she had taken a taxi there from New Orleans.

*** END QUOTE ***

When I Saw This Court Order, I Thought Immediately of You  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20011212/tc/tech_magiclantern_dc_1.html

The FBI has confirmed it's working on a project called ""Magic Lantern"" that ""would allow the agency to plant a Trojan horse keystroke logger on a target's PC by sending a computer virus over the Internet,"" Reuters reports. The agency would need a court order before it could send the virus.

DeLay Can't Wait  http://www.rollcall.com/pages/news/00/2001/12/news1213a.html

Roll Call reports that House Republican whip Tom DeLay has the votes to succeed Dick Armey as House majority leader.  Paul Gigot  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/pgigot/?id=95001582  broke the story of Armey's retirement.

Why Not Ammo Vouchers?  http://www.hollandsentinel.com/stories/121201/loc_121201013.shtml

Why do some social conservatives continue to vote Democratic? The Holland (Mich.) Sentinel quotes an explanation from Mark Brewer, Michigan's Democratic chairman: ""A lot of people in our party are pro-life--it's the same thing when you talk about the gun issue. What unifies us tends to be the economic issues. I tell people, 'If you don't have a job, you can't afford a gun, let alone the ammunition.' We're a very diverse party.""

Those Wild Republicans  http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_np=0&u_pg=36&u_sid=260627

The Omaha World-Herald reports that a melee broke out the other night at a meeting of Omaha Young Republicans--the second time in a month that police have been called to break up a fight at the GOP group's meetings. ""Police arrested a 38-year-old Omaha man who had been banned from the sports bar where the group meets after starting a brawl at its Nov. 12 meeting,"" the paper reports. ""The man was booked Tuesday on suspicion of refusing to leave and obstructing an officer, both misdemeanors. He was being held late Tuesday at the Police Headquarters.""

Meanwhile,  Reuters  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20011212/re/people_young_dc_1.html  reports that ""South Park"" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker announced at a convention of the liberal-left People for the American Way that they're ""proud Republicans.""  Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com  quickly pronounced himself the third ""South Park Republican.""

The Lights Are On, but No One's Home  http://www.nationalreview.com/derbyshire/derbyshire121301.shtml

London's Tate Gallery has awarded its prestigious Turner prize to 33-year-old Martin Creed for ""an empty room with lights that flicker on and off every five seconds,"" National Review's John Derbyshire writes. ""Mr. Creed's previous exhibits include a scrunched-up sheet of plain typing paper, a piece of plasticine stuck to a wall, and neon signs bearing cheery messages"":

*** QUOTE ***

Prior to the announcement of Mr. Creed's triumph, the favorite for the prize was Mike Nelson, who (I am quoting here from a British newspaper report) ""works with rubbish,"" and whose prize submission was a pile of planks. The other shortlisted artists were Richard Billingham, exhibiting photos of his alcoholic father, who lives in a Glasgow slum, and Isaac Julien, who entered some short films about homosexual cowboys.

*** END QUOTE ***

Then there's James Beal, who, the  Associated Press  http://www.mlive.com/newsflash/index.ssf?/cgi-free/getstory_ssf.cgi?g9791_BC_MI--ManureAssault&&news&newsflash-michigan  reports, works with porcupine feces and worms. He won an award . . . oh, sorry, actually he was arrested:

*** QUOTE ***

According to a court affidavit from Postal Inspector Ted Andersen, Postmaster Virginia Raz called Beal on Oct. 17 and suggested that he resign [from his job as a relief postmaster in Empire, Mich.] because of poor performance.

""If you want to play rough, fire me,"" Beal replied, according to the affidavit. ""I will roast you in this . . . town.""
 
Raz immediately fired him. The next day, Beal said he took the two buckets of fecal matter and worms, which he had gathered in some woods, to the post office.

He said he threw the contents of one bucket at several employees, then left for about 30 seconds before returning with the second bucket to splatter more muck on mail and another employee. . . .

Beal's actions also halted local mail delivery the next day while a hazardous-materials team cleaned and repackaged mail with a note explaining the damage.

*** END QUOTE ***

If we get one of those letters, we're forwarding it to the Tate Gallery.

"KOMP Horticultural - Sale of Leased Plants","
The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. 2001 Portfolio +36%; 2002 Portfolio Just Released (C)

In December 2000, Frank Curzio issued a portfolio of 10 stocks he
predicted would do well in the coming year. He was right. Despite
the market's troubles, his portfolio gained an impressive +36%.
Aiming for a repeat performance, he just released his portfolio
for 2002. ""Do not procrastinate,"" he advises. ""We urge investors
to buy all of our situations. Do not just pick and choose.""

One of Curzio's picks is Citigroup (C). The financial services
goliath stands to do well during an economic turnaround
particularly while interest rates remain low. Curzio sees
management making the right moves to boost earnings; for instance,
it will spin-off 20% of its Travelers Insurance group in 2002.

Another Curzio recommendation is to sell short Broadcom (BRCM).
The firm's chips enable broadband digital data transmission to
residences and businesses over communication networks. Curzio
considers today's short-term economic uncertainty and calls the
stock ""overvalued"" with a P/E multiple near 140. ""Look for a
steady pullback throughout the first quarter. Sell short,"" Curzio
advises.

For more on Frank Curzio's advice see ""FXC's 10 Picks for 2002.""
Francis X. Curzio provides asset growth and capital preservation
with a list of picks in key categories for the coming year.

----------------------------------------------------------
2. Forecast 2002: Mostly Sunny, Particularly for Small Caps (NYFX)

In January 2001, Jim Oberweis made a number of predictions for the
year that hit the bullseye. For example, the market rallied in
early 2001 but fell for most of the year. Small-caps outperformed
large-caps, and short-term interest rates fell sharply while bond
rates rose, eliminating the inverted yield curve. For 2002,
Oberweis sees large-caps returning an average 8% to 10%, well
below the 20% annual average of the 1990s. ""We continue to believe
that small-caps will buck the trend and offer very good
opportunities for investors,"" he predicts.

To capitalize, Oberweis offers a list of five new small-cap picks.
One of these is Nyfix (NYFX). The firm makes electronic trading
systems for brokerages that trade in equities and derivatives.
Blue-chip customers like Lehman Brothers, Deutsche Bank, UBS
Warburg and Merrill Lynch use the Nyfix Network to send trading
orders to exchange floors electronically.

Last quarter, revenues grew a healthy 75% to $11.4 million and
boosted EPS 65% to $0.10. Oberweis sees Nyfix growing revenues
(and EPS) from $24 million ($0.21) in 2000 to $40 million ($0.32)
in 2001 and again to $60 million ($1.05) in 2002. His asset
management clients now own roughly 34,000, and he maintains a buy
sign on the stock.

For more on Jim Oberweis' advice see ""Currently Recommended
Stocks,"" January 2002, The Oberweis Report. Jim Oberweis invests
in small-cap stocks with revenue and earnings growing at least 30%
and mid-caps growing at least 20%.

-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Time to Buy Disney (DIS)

Chuck Carlson admits having a tough time getting excited about
Disney (DIS). For instance, the entertainment giant's theme park
is mired by a sluggish economy, fears of terrorism and erratic gas
prices. The anemic ad market continues to hurt its ABC network,
and its film business has turned in a spotty performance.

Carlson sees today's slump as a buy opportunity. ""Disney has brand
names that would make any marketer salivate,"" he says. The firm
has not had a new hit TV show since ""Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire,"" but Carlson says Disney's creative teams ""don't stay
in dry spells for very long."" Also, consumers will eventually
start flying to its theme parks again as economic and terrorist
concerns abate.

At today's low prices, stock in Disney is fully discounting bad
earnings for at least the next two quarters, according to Carlson.
Shares are well off their 2000 highs near $44. That means
investors can buy ""a quality blue chip at an affordable price,""
Carlson says. He recommends buying as ""the stock offers good long-
term upside potential.""

For more on Chuck Carlson's advice see ""DRIP Analyst,"" January
2002, DRIP Investor. Chuck Carlson provides guidance to buying
stocks without a broker via dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs).

----------------------------------------------------------
4. Zacks: Biovail Set to Gain 10+% in 2002 (BVF)

Ben Zacks does not beat around the bush about the prospects for
Biovail (BVF). ""Investors who buy Biovail in the $54 - $55 range
can expect an appreciation of 10+% over the next 12 months,"" Zacks
says. The firm makes medicines based on its proprietary oral
controlled-release drug delivery technology. Its biggest hit is
Tiazac, a treatment for hypertension and angina. Tiazac beats
competing drugs as it requires only a daily dose and has fewer
side effects.

Zacks lists many other reasons why Biovail is a good bet for 2002.
For example, revenues last quarter grew 63% to $152.2 million, net
income rose 37% to $55.8 million, and the firm beat analyst EPS
estimates of $0.36 by a penny a share. Also, Biovail just inked a
host of marketing pacts with Glaxo Smith Kline that should boost
sales.

Biovail shares are not cheap at 33x EPS estimates of $1.66 for
2002. But Zacks remains optimistic. ""The high valuation is
justified by the company's high long-term EPS growth rate of 30%,""
he says. He agrees with six of the 16 analysts covering Biovail
who maintain a 'strong buy' rating.

For more on Ben Zacks' advice see ""Stock Pick of the Month,""
January 2002, Zacks Advisor. Ben Zacks uses earnings estimate
revisions from analysts at brokerages to select stocks likely to
outperform the market over the next 12 months.

5. Smallest Stocks are the Places to Be (BLPG)

The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks just chalked up its
third straight year of outperformance by advancing 1% vs. a -13%
slump for the S&P 500. Rich Moroney sees more growth like this in
2002 as small-stock cycles like this one ""tend to persist."" In
particular, micro-caps should see another great year even after
providing the bulk of last year's growth.

Moroney profiles two micro-caps he calls ""especially promising""
for 2002. The first is Boron, LePore & Associates (BLPG), who
provides marketing, education and sales services to healthcare
providers. The stock jumped 65% since hitting bottom in September
2001 due to profit and terrorism concerns. But Moroney predicts
significant improvements for the December quarter thanks to a
rebound in travel and postponed business.

A consensus of analysts pegs Q4 EPS at $0.21, a gain of 40% over
the same quarter last year. Management forecasts full-year EPS
will reach $0.80 to $0.84. Moroney calls the stock ""reasonably
priced"" at 20x 2002 estimates and below 1x sales. ""The stock, with
support near $12.25, is rated 'buy',"" he says.

For more on Rich Moroney's advice see ""Featured Report,"" January
7, 2002, Low Priced Stock Survey. Richard Moroney offers
fundamentally solid small- and mid-caps ready to soar 40% to
400%+.

      I heard that you got a chip for the diesel.  Does it make a big
      difference
      in performance.

"Northern Natural Gas","Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Bribe and Groom
During the wedding rehearsal, the groom approached the pastor with an
unusual offer:
""Look, I'll give you $100 if you'll change the wedding vows. When you get to
the part where I'm supposed to promise to 'love, honor and obey' and 'be
faithful to her forever,' I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave that out.""
He passed the minister a $100 bill and walked away satisfied. On the day of
the wedding, when it came time for the groom's vows, the pastor looked the
young man in the eye and said:
""Will you promise to prostrate yourself before her, obey her every command
and wish, serve her breakfast in bed every morning of your life, and swear
eternally before God and your lovely wife that you will not ever even look
at another woman, as long as you both shall live?""
The groom gulped and looked around, and said in a tiny voice, ""Yes,"" then
leaned toward the pastor and hissed: ""I thought we had a deal.""
The pastor put a $100 bill into the groom's hand and whispered: ""She made me
a better offer.""

Best of the Web Today - January 11, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Desperately Seeking Scandal  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28350-2002Jan10.html

As we noted yesterday, there's a move afoot to find a White House scandal amid the ruins of Enron; we're eagerly waiting to learn if Slate or The New Republic will be the first to dub it ""Enronamok."" But what exactly is the scandal? The New York Times' Bob Herbert and others have been blowing a lot of smoke about the supposedly cozy relationship between President Bush and Enron honcho Ken Lay, whose executives donated loads of money to the Bush campaign (and smaller loads to Democratic candidates). The implication is that Enron was buying influence. There's something strange about the logic here, though: If Enron were profiting from a quid pro quo, how come it's bankrupt?

Yesterday the White House disclosed that before filing for bankruptcy, Lay asked for help from Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Donald Evans. Both rebuffed him. Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) tells  ABC News  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/business/DailyNews/enron_inquiry020111.html : ""It is now clear the White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings.""

Oh, now we get it! The scandal is that Enron didn't get special treatment from the administration. Why didn't we think of that?

Where Was Waxman Then?  http://www.drudgereport.com/flash2.htm

The Drudge Report unearths this item, from the Sept. 1, 1997, issue of Time magazine:

*** QUOTE ***

On Nov. 22, 1995 President Clinton scrawled an FYI note to chief of staff Mack McLarty, enclosing a newspaper article on Enron Corp. and the vicissitudes of its $3 billion power-plant project in India.

McLarty then reached out to Enron's chairman, Ken Lay, and over the next nine months closely monitored the project with the U.S. ambassador to New Delhi, keeping Lay informed of the Administration's efforts, according to White House documents reviewed by Time magazine.

In June 1996, four days before India granted final approval to Enron's controversial $3 billion power-plant project, Enron's gave $100,000 to President Clinton's party.

Enron denies that its gift was repayment for Clinton's attention, and White House special counsel Lanny Davis says McLarty acted out of concern for a major U.S. investment overseas, Time's Michael Weisskopf reported.

*** END QUOTE ***

Drudge adds: ""McLarty was later hired by Enron. Lay also played golf with President Bill Clinton and slept in the Clinton White House. A master of political manipulation of both parties, Lay served as an adviser to the Clinton White House on energy issues. The Clinton administration, in turn, helped Enron get a contract for a gas pipeline in Mozambique and other projects, according to reports.""

Making Singapore Safer  http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/11/ret.singapore.plot/index.html

""An al-Qaeda plot targeting the U.S. Navy in Singapore has been foiled as the direct result of intelligence gathered in Afghanistan,"" CNN reports. U.S. officials say the plot ""included plans to attack U.S. Navy ships, U.S. Navy personnel and popular nightspots frequented by sailors. The 17,000 Americans living in Singapore and other non-Singapore residents also were among the targets.""

Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?  http://www.miami.com/herald/digdocs/106714.htm

At least four South Florida men with Arab names are under surveillance in connection with a possible plot to assassinate Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's kid brother, with a truck bomb, the Miami Herald reports. Florida state police heard of the purported plot from a Broward County jailbird, and they aren't sure how seriously to take his claims. ""The informant has failed several lie-detector tests and may simply be trying to cut a deal with prosecutors in his own criminal case, investigators said. But the information has also panned out at least once: On Thursday, his tip led investigators to a van in Broward County that apparently contained traces of explosives.""

Why Osama bin Laden Must Die  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/11/opinion/11GERE.html

Author and ex-CIA man Reuel Marc Gerecht warns in a New York Times op-ed (link requires registration) of the danger of letting Osama bin Laden get away:

*** QUOTE ***

The Bush administration would do well not to confuse the impact of America's military victory over the Taliban with that over Osama bin Laden. Mullah Muhammad Omar, the Taliban leader, was essentially a tribal chieftain--his spiritual supremacy over the Taliban was inextricably tied to the city and province of Kandahar. With Kandahar's fall, he and his inner circle lost the aura that allowed them to rule.

Osama bin Laden is different. The source of his power isn't tied to geography. His springs from bitterness and shame over the weakness of Islam's once glorious and militarily strong civilization, and a desire to make America taste that bitterness. He has promised to his suicide bombers and followers that America has not the will to sustain itself in a long ""guerrilla war (of) fast-moving, light forces that work under complete secrecy.""

If we hunt for him and bomb his sanctuaries but don't find and kill him, we will only add to his appeal and set him up for the next spectacular act of terrorism. Since we cannot avoid this conundrum, we must not temper our resolve to get him with the usual concern about the sovereignty of any foreign state where he may be.

Hey Pakistan, that means you. The  Bloomberg News Service  http://quote.bloomberg.com/fgcgi.cgi?T=uspolitics_news.ht&s=APD2SkBUaUGFraXN0  reports that Islamabad ""denied allowing U.S. forces to enter its territory in pursuit of escaping al-Qaeda or Taliban fighters from Afghanistan.""

The Ones Who Got Away  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28264-2002Jan10.html

Those seven Taliban who were released by the governor of Kandahar weren't such big fish after all, the Washington Post reports. ""Only one was a former cabinet minister and none was on the list of Taliban figures wanted by the United States, Afghan officials said."" Initial reports said that the Taliban defense minister, Obaidullah, was among the group, but it turns out to have been a junior official with the same name.

Fear of a Black Hat  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,3-2002018699,00.html

The Times of London reports that men in Kandahar are donning the ""trademark black turbans"" of the Taliban. ""There are more than 5,000 Taleban still roaming the streets of this decrepit, bustling city,"" and some hope to return to power one day. The Times quotes 27-year-old Nooruddin:

*** QUOTE ***

""In the days before, we all received a letter from Mullah Omar, ordering us to take our weapons with us or hide them in the annexes of the mosques. Then suddenly on that Friday morning we received the order: all Talebs were to leave the city. In his letter Mullah Omar said he did not know what would be our fate. But many, many Talebs believe his decision to pull out of Kandahar was a good one, to save the Taleban from complete destruction. Many of us hope that one day we will resume our duty of jihad.""

I Ran, You Ran, They All Ran to Iran  http://usatoday.com/usatonline/20020111/3765561s.htm

""U.S. officials said Iran is providing safe haven to a small number of al-Qaeda fighters,"" USA Today reports. Iranian officials deny the report. America also says ""the Tehran government has sent increasing numbers of intelligence operatives into western Afghanistan"" in hopes of undermining the latter nation's new, U.S.-backed government.

The good news in all this is that the disagreements over Afghanistan, along with Iran's involvement in the foiled shipment of weapons to Palestinian terrorists, has, as USA Today puts it, ""dealt a setback"" to ""the closest cooperation between the United States and Iran in two decades."" We don't want to cooperate with the lunatic ayatollahs who run Iran; we want them out of there.

Help Explain Things to Colin  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020111/ts/us_mideast_21.html

""Powell Wants Explanation From Arafat,"" reads the headline on an Associated Press dispatch about the seized weapons shipment. Reader S.E. Brenner suggests this explanation: ""It was research for a film part."" If you have a witty or imaginative explanation, e-mail it to us at  The Specter of Communism  mailto:opinionjournal@wsj.com

National Review's Jay Nordlinger notes this comment from Cuban ""attorney general"" Juan Escalona on the transfer of al Qaeda prisoners to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base: ""It's another provocation from the Americans. I hope 15 or 20 get out and kill them."" Nordlinger also notes that  Sen. Arlen Specter  http://www.senate.gov/%7Especter/ , a Pennsylvania Republican, led a delegation to Cuba last week to meet with Fidel Castro. One of Specter's guests, Philadelphia Daily News columnist  Michael Smerconish  http://dailynews.philly.com/content/daily_news/2002/01/07/local/SMER07C.htm , produced an appalling puff piece on the Cuban dictator, accompanied by a photo of Castro being presented a New York City Fire Department cap by Philadelphia lawyer  Tom Kline  http://www.klinespecter.com/lawyers/kline/kline.html , whose partner,  Shanin Specter  http://www.klinespecter.com/lawyers/specter/specter.html?48,77 , is the senator's son.

'We Quickly Issued a Revised Version'

We heard from our good friend Nancy Bobrowitz, senior vice president of Reuters, about  yesterday's item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001707#reuter  on a Reuters dispatch referring to America giving Israel ""weaponry used to kill Palestinians"":

*** QUOTE ***

Regarding the Reuters story you mentioned today, as you can tell from our news file we also saw this and quickly issued a revised version.

The original story clearly ran counter to our policy, which is to report the news in an objective fashion. We view this as a serious matter and a breach of internal policies. We are taking it up with the editorial staff concerned.

*** END QUOTE ***

Here's another bit of Reuters ridiculousness, albeit not a new one: In a  Dec. 10 dispatch  http://ca.news.yahoo.com/011210/5/fhr3.html  from Kabul, Reuters refers to Osama bin Laden as a ""bogeyman."" Now,  bogeyman  http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=bogeyman  can mean ""a terrifying or dreaded person or thing,"" but the first dictionary definition, and we'd guess the more common meaning, is ""a monstrous imaginary figure used in threatening children."" It seems terrorism is the only word Reuters is careful about using.

Muslims Define Terrorism  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=11893

A group of Muslim scholars met in Mecca and agreed on a definition of terrorism: ""It covers all acts of aggression unjustly committed by individuals, groups or states against human beings including attacks on their religion, life, intellect, property or honor,"" as quoted in the Arab News. Of course, the Clintonian weasel word is unjustly; to too many Muslims, it's always just to kill Jews in Israel.

Stupidity Watch  http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/envirowrapper.jsp?PID=1051-450&CID=1051-011002D

Environmentalists now have their own Jerry Falwell. USA Today's David Mastio, writing for Tech Central Station.com, notes the following passage from Worldwatch Institute head  Christopher Flavin  http://www.worldwatch.org/bios/flavin.html 's introduction to the institute's  State of the World 2002  http://www.worldwatch.org/pubs/sow/2002/  report (emphasis Mastio's):

*** QUOTE ***

It is now clear in a way that it never was before that the world of the early twenty-first century is far from stable. At a time when we are still adding a billion people to the human population every 15 years, many societies are struggling with the difficult transition from traditional rural societies to modern, urban, middle-class ones. In many of these societies, basic human needs for food, water, health care, and education are not being met, with over a billion people living on less than a dollar a day. Moreover, the lack of democratic political representation and the concentration of economic and political power in a few hands has created a fundamental instability in many nations--an instability that echoes around the world in the form of large-scale human migration, illegal drug exports, and, increasingly, terrorism. If the lofty social and ecological goals of the Rio Earth Summit had been achieved, it is possible that the crisis of the last year would not have occurre!

Bonior's Terror-Linked Donors   http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=2947801&BRD=988&PAG=461&dept_id=141265&rfi=6

The Macomb (Mich.) Daily reports that Rep. David Bonoir, a Michigan Democrat who's running for governor, decided to keep $1,000 donated by Abdurahman Alamoudi after he ""secured an apology"" for statements Alamoudi made in 2000 supporting the anti-Israel terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. ""The story expanded when the Lansing State Journal reported that Bonior's 2000 re-election campaign received $3,200 from an Arab-American who's allegedly linked to a terrorist group""--Sami Al-Arian, a Florida professor who founded a Muslim think tank that the FBI believed was a terrorist front group and raided in 1995. Al-Arian was never charged and ""has vehemently denied that he supports terrorism.""

School's Out  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020111/ts/bush_recess_appointments_4.html

President Bush has signed two recess appointments--for Eugene Scalia as Labor Department solicitor and Otto Reich as assistant secretary of state. Senate Democrats had refused to allow a vote on either man, though Scalia commanded the support of a majority of senators and Reich probably did. The appointments allow them to serve without confirmation until Congress's next recess, at the end of the year.

Worse Than the Disease?

http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20020111/pl/irradiated_mail_illness_1.html  ""A package irradiated as part of the government's anti-anthrax screening gave off a noxious gas Thursday when it was opened at the Commerce Department, sickening at least 11 workers,"" the Associated Press reports. ""The workers complained of nausea, breathing problems and throat irritation, and two were admitted to a hospital in undetermined condition, D.C. Fire Department spokesman Alan Etter said."" We'd be steamed if something like this happened to us.

No More 'Wrongful Birth'   http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/europe/newsid_1752000/1752556.stm

The lower house of the French Parliament has voted to overturn a court ruling allowing disabled Frenchmen to sue, claiming that they have a ""right not to be born."" We noted the ruling   last month  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001580#french  under the headline "" 'French Civilization': An Oxymoron,"" which, it turns out, may have been too harsh.
 
Double Suicide Doublespeak   http://www.citypaper.net/articles/011002/sl.loose.shtml

The Philadelphia City Paper notes this paid obituary that appeared in the New York Times:

*** QUOTE ***

Chester W., Rear Admiral, age 86, and his wife, Joan Labern Nimitz, age 89, of Needham and Wellfleet, Mass., and formerly of Boca Grande, Fla., [died] by mutual consent on January 2, 2002 at their home in Needham.""

"River Market Meeting and ballot","Subject: RiverMarket Public Meeting and Ballot for the Election
The ballot listed below lists the 13 propostions on the February 2 ballot and
the gentlemen running for City Council.  Proposition 1 has to do with the new
pool.

I attended the meeting about the proposed pool tonight and it was quite
interesting.   It is not my place to be political.  My job is to keep you
informed.  Therefore, let me say one word -- VOTE.  I hope that we will be
informed voters and that we will be an area of League City that will exercise
our right to vote.  As we ask for things from the city and the school
district it helps to let them know that we are an active group of voters in
CCV.  Remember, if you do not vote, you cannot complain later.  :)  Thank you
to everyone from CCV who attended the meeting tonight.  We were a large
protion of the group.  Mary G. Strickland


A Public Meeting for the proposed League City RiverMarket will be held on
Monday, January 14,2002, 6:30pm at the Johnnie Arolfo Civic Center in League
City.
Consultants have been hired to create a master plan for a mixed use project
along the south side of Clear Creek from Interstate 45 to FM 270.  Mape,
drawings and photos depicting various features of the project will be
presented for public comment.

"RE: Minutes and actions from todays UBS start up meeting","Debra,

Same list as previous email.  This one has TPs on ""East no Duplicates"" tab that are not on your master list highlited in yellow.  I don't know of any other transmission lists.

Reagan,

Thank you for the heads up.  So far the agreements I have discussed with the TP's sound like blanket agreements for firm and non-firm transmission.  Once I get my hands on the paperwork, I would like to review each TP with the group to make sure we are covered for all services we will require.

Debra,

As I continue to look through these lists, it is apparent that there are potentially more than one agreement with the TPs.  For example:
point to point
firm
non-firm
short term firm
non-firm
etc....

I am not up to speed on all the different blanket trans agreements we might need or are available.  It seems they all are a bit differently named but fall into similiar transmission classes??  I noticed the Agreement Required column, and it does indicate multiple agreements.  Just want to make sure we don't miss one with a TP.

INVESTools Advisory
Compiled by John Brobst, INVESTools.com


1. Toral: ""Prepare for a Good 2002"" (DYII)

Al Toral says investors now anticipate a recovery, and he
reminds skeptics of how easily the market overcame
disappointing news about Q3 GDP. Corporate inventories now
need replenishing, lower energy costs and interest rates are
encouraging near-term growth, and labor costs have dropped.
""Each one of us breathes a sigh of relief now that the year
2001 is behind us, and all of us will find that the market
in 2002 will be far more productive and rewarding,"" he says.

To capitalize, Toral recommends buying stock in a list of
handpicked companies, and one of his favorites is Dynacq
International (DYII). The firm provides home care infusion
services and supplies. It also trains patients to administer
medicines and nutrients themselves through IVs and feeding
tubes.

Dynacq has been growing rapidly. Revenues rose from $11
million in 1998 to over $31 million for the first three
quarters of 2001. Profit margins averaged 18% and earnings
grew 100+% over the last three years. Three stock splits
rewarded investors since 1998. ""We see Dynacq as an
excellent growth stock that is not too volatile for the
conservative investor,"" Toral says.

For more on Al Toral's advice see ""Cyberlution,"" January
2002, The Pure Fundamentalist. Alvin Toral uses key
fundamental data to select aggressive growth stocks.

2. A Leader in Telecom's Eventual Rebound (ADCT)

ADC Telecommunications (ADCT) enjoyed a nice long run.
Through the 1990s, revenues grew more than tenfold and
peaked at over $3 billion in 2000. Its stock reflected this
as it peaked at $49. But when the telecom bubble burst,
sales for ADC dropped 27% from the prior year to $2.4
billion. The firm posted an annual loss of $1.64 a share,
its first since 1985.

But turnaround expert George Putnam sees better times ahead
for the supplier of products for fiber optics, networking,
equipment and software. ""Telecom will be one of the leading
industries for the foreseeable future,"" he says. ""We believe
ADC will not only survive, but perhaps be one of the first
telecom suppliers to rebound."" He points to its cash-rich
and debt-free balance sheet, layoffs of 40+%, and other
measures that cut capital expenditures by 60%.

Putnam sees signs that ADC's business is already rebounding.
For instance, the firm just won several new contracts and is
gaining market share. A rebounding economy means more demand
for communication services, and Putnam says that means
growing demand for ADC's equipment. ""We recommend buying ADC
up to $7,"" he says.

For more on George Putnam's advice see ""Recommendation,""
January 2002, The Turnaround Letter. George Putnam
concentrates on out-of-favor companies ripe for a turnaround
while trading at a discount to their true value.

3. Rip-Roaring Returns from the Post-September 2001 Rebound
(EMC)

Steve Harmon made some great calls around the September 2001
market bottom. For instance, he said ""buy"" to eight stocks
in the travel security sector. All but one of these is
handsomely in the black, with standouts like Invision
Technologies (INVN) gaining +262% and Identix (IDNX) up
+103%. He also said ""buy"" to Checkpoint Software (CHKP), and
it has since gained a healthy 68%.

Going forward, one of Harmon's favorite sectors is network
technology. Current favorites include data storage kingpin
EMC (EMC). ""Today's commerce relies heavily on intellectual
assets -- DATA -- without which corporations would be
hampered to do business,"" Harmon says. Little wonder that
EMC's client list is chock full of Fortune 500 companies.

But Harmon's current favorite is Network Appliance (NTAP),
whose shares have rocketed 80% to $26 since November 2001.
The firm recently launched NearStore, a new data storage
solution that enterprise clients can use to restore data
cheaply and quickly. ""With EMC, NTAP, Hitachi (HIT) and IBM
(IBM), you could own a basket of the leaders in storage as a
sector play in the near-term,"" Harmon recommends.

For more on Steve Harmon's advice see ""Network Technology,""
December 2001, Broadband Investor. Steve Harmon puts
investors at the forefront of the convergence of technology,
entertainment, communication, commerce and fiber-optics.

4. Rex Stores Still a Bargain (RSC)

Stock in Rex Stores (RSC) has climbed over 55% from $18 in
July 2001 to over $28. The retailer buys current models of
consumer electronics and appliances that become available at
a discount because of manufacturer overruns and cancelled
orders. Buyback expert David Fried first recommended Rex
last July and he sees more growth in store even after its
price runup.

""Management has put its money where its mouth is,"" Fried
says. Over the past year, Rex bought back over 25% of its
outstanding shares, and today's buyback program allows it to
repurchase another 10%. Recent results show why. Q3 EPS rose
72% to $0.50 thanks to a rise in gross margins to 28.5% that
boosted net income 55% to $4.4 million.

Fried notes that Rex's market cap is about $180 million;
this is just $40 million more than a conservative estimate
of the after-tax value of tax credits and depreciated value
of real estate on the books. ""Buying $1 for $0.66 is an easy
decision,"" he says. ""We are confident that this holding will
add to our outstanding record of picks in our portfolio.""

wealth-building opportunities in companies repurchasing
their stock.

5. Enron Debt Woes Bad News for Bank (JPM)

JP Morgan Chase (JPM) continues to be plagued by its
exposure to debt from failed energy trader Enron. The
venerable bank recently said this exposure is $1 billion
more than the $900 million previously announced. Adding
insult to injury, a group of insurers continue to delay
payment of $965 million until the bank says more about its
forward sales contracts to Enron.

Bernie Schaeffer sees more tough times ahead for JP Morgan
Chase & advises an option play to capitalize. He notes that
shares continue to trade below their 10-day and 20-day
moving averages after bouncing off of the $40 level in
November and December. Longer term, the stock trades far
below its 10-month, 20-month and 40-month moving averages,
all of which are heading south.

Meanwhile, always-wrong option punters lowered short
interest by 12% last month. Schaeffer sees the moves of
option traders as a contrary indicator. He recently advised
buying the June 40 put (JPMRH).

For more on Bernie Schaeffer's advice see ""Aggressive
Portfolio,"" January 2002, The Option Advisor. Bernie
Schaeffer provides practical option investing
recommendations that are simple to understand and execute.

Subject:	FW: Move Related Issues



As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 4  boxes per person.  

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

PLEASE NOTE THAT WE WILL NEED TO BE PACKED AND READY TO MOVE BY 2PM ON FRIDAY, 11/16/01.

Please let me know if you have any questions...thanks for your support with the move.

T.Jae, Lisa, Claudia & Lloyd

"URGENT BULLETIN: Don't Make This Mistake...","Dear Investor,

I know ""hope springs eternal,"" but please don't let
it blind you to what's really going on.

Tech stocks have staged a very impressive rally since
October 1st.  So we're out of the woods, right?  We're
on our way to a new bull market, right?  And
everything is well in technology land, right?

WRONG!

And if you make the same mistake I see many investors
making -- and jump back in tech stocks like it's 1999
all over again -- you will likely lose your shirt.

YOU SEE, much of the rise in tech stocks is attributable
to ""short covering"" -- and it won't continue with the
breadth and power folks are dreaming of.  Why?  Because
the entire tech sector still has an erratic and
unpredictable earnings outlook.

To simplify it even further, earnings for most tech
companies STINK!

Tech companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning
in red ink.  And most won't have positive earnings news
for the next 7-to-10 months.  That's why most tech
stocks -- while they've popped off their lows -- offer
much greater risk than potential reward for the foreseeable
future.

IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn handsome
profits you can take to the bank -- you must invest in
those companies I call ""EARNINGS MONSTERS.""

That's the term I use for companies bucking the current
trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from
30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn
anything at all.  These ""EARNINGS MONSTERS"" are the only
sort of stocks we own at my Blue Chip Growth Advisory.
And they're the only stocks that YOU should even think
of owning now.

I've written to you several times about out ""Earnings
Monsters"" over the last few months.  And I'm sorry you
haven't yet joined my roster of Blue Chip Growth clients
because you're MISSING OUT:

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we own
at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just strong
earnings growth.  It's already UP 103% for the year!

*PeopleSoft is one of the few tech stocks I own today.
Why?  Solid 30%+ earnings growth so far in 2001.  In fact,
3rd quarter profits ""beat the street"" by 25%.  The result?
The stock is UP 97% since October 1st.

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in times
like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually recession-proof
business.  It's up a nice, stomach-calming 36% YTD.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is hogging
all the profits.  The company announced chart-topping
earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and its stock is UP
20% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED 251%
since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because it's one of
very few tech stocks that's still an EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the EARNINGS
MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late 1997,
our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-to-1, thanks
to our commitment to earnings quality.  And the advisory I
started in the mid-1980's, MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in
the last 16 years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a company
keeps performing, I love it...things start looking iffy, I
take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We SOLD
Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209% gains overall
from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in Microsoft; 179% in
Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 320% in Dell Computer; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  All stocks we SOLD
last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's why I
urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip Growth.  It's
simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR PROFITS -- in any kind of
market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-FREE.
You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a dime.  I'll give
you six months to try the service risk-free -- set the bar
as high as you want.  Sign up now.  I'll introduce you to
the EARNINGS MONSTERS that are your best bet for 50%
gains -- or more -- over the next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. Overall, insider buying is the strongest it has been in
years.  That's great news -- but not for tech stocks.  In
fact, many tech insiders are SELLING to raise money for taxes
they owe on options conversions last year.  That'll just knock
many tech stocks for a loop again.  So stay away!  Buy our
EARNINGS MONSTERS instead.  Click here now:

"Tech Portfolio Posts Stellar Gains in 2001!","
		
 	 INVESTools Update  Tech Portfolio Posts Stellar Gains in 2001!    2001 has been a difficult year for many investors, as stock prices have plummeted from news of war, poor company earnings estimates and increasing corporate layoffs.   But some stocks (and some investors) are actually posting huge gains this year!   Subscribers to David Fried's The Buyback Letter  are earning stellar profits for the year, as the 5-stock High Tech Portfolio has gained an incredible +39.23% YTD(+9.61 in November alone), while his Stock Pickers Portfolio is up over 31% for the year. By contrast, The Nasdaq lost 21% of its value over the same time frame.   Fried's other portfolios have hit their stride in November, as the Buyback Dogs Portfolio earned an impressive +14.57% for the month, his 20-Stock Buyback Index gained +6.11%, and his Buyback Income Index shot up +5.61%  And these profits are not uncommon for Fried, whose 5-year performance has earned him the coveted #1 ranking by newsletter watchdog Hulbert Financial Digest.Since inception, Fried's Stockpickers Portfolio has gained 146% (vs. only +84% for the S&P 500.)  In addition, his 5-stock Buyback Dogs portfolio is up 104.93% since inception vs. +42% for the S&P 500 over the same time frame. 19 of Fried's last 22 trades have been profitable, with an average profit of 179%!       A Huge Profit Opportunity For Today's Buyback Investors?   Right now may be the best time for investors to get back into the market, as a potentially  huge buying opportunity has emerged for buyback investors who act immediately:    ""Investors who focus on stock buybacks have a serious advantage in the current market,"" Fried says. ""Recent moves by the Securities and Exchange Commission have made it easier for companies to buy back their stock while share prices are at their weakest. This ultimately creates higher earnings per share and, therefore, stronger share prices.""  In the current issue of The Buyback Letter (available FREE for 30 days from INVESTools ), Fried lists his new ""Best Buy"" stocks that represent your best value right now. Insiders in these companies are bullish about their firms, and management are buying back their stock on the open market.   Click Here for these top Buyback Stocks and your FREE 30-Day Subscription to The Buyback Letter     Why The Average Buyback Value Stock  Outperforms The Market By 45.3%:  The New York Times  reports that a study of all U.S. stocks from 1980-1990 found  that the stock of an average company announcing a repurchase plan will  beat the  market decisively (12.1% for the average company, 45.3% for a value stock) in  the four years following the repurchase announcement.  This makes sense. After all, when a company buys back their own stock, it's  an  enormous vote of confidence  by those who know it best - senior executives. No  one else knows the firm's financial situation, market share, business plans,  competitive advantages and new product strategies better than those with  hands-on, day-to-day experience.  But, these executives aren't talking. They keep their plans, tactics, and  research behind closed doors.  The only indicator of their well-founded optimism  is a stock buyback. It's a powerful indicator that no serious investor should  ignore.   Just how powerful are buyback stocks? In the last 10 years if you had invested  $10,000 in a typical S&P 500 portfolio, you investment would have grown to  $67,917 - an excellent return. But that same $10,000 invested exclusively in  value buyback stocks would have grown to $130,254 - nearly $70,000 more in profits!   The Buyback Letter is available FREE for 30 days from INVESTools.  With your FREE 30-Day Subscription, you'll be on the inside track of the market's safest blue-chip companies that are aggressively buying back their own stock.

"OpinionJournal - Best of the Web Today - January 22, 2002","  From http://OpinionJournal.com

Best of the Web Today - January 22, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Whitewashing Ramsey Clark  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/21/attacks.detention.ap/index.html

LBJ attorney general-cum-lunatic Ramsey Clark is pursuing a frivolous lawsuit on behalf of the terrorist prisoners at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. The case--which demands that a federal judge in Los Angeles assert his jurisdiction over Gitmo, which is in Cuba--isn't worthy of comment.

What we're wondering, though, is why do the media--this CNN report is just one example--invariably refer to Clark as a ""civil rights advocate""? He is nothing of the sort. As we  documented last October  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001248#ramsey , Clark is the founder of something called the  International Acition Center  http://www.iacenter.org/ , a far-left outfit that makes common cause with just about every one of America's enemies (none of which, as it happens, have much respect for civil rights). Clark should be described as an ""anti-American advocate,"" not a ""civil rights advocate."" The former may sound harsh, but the latter is a lie.

Guardian Angels  http://www.nationalpost.com/home/story.html?f=/stories/20020122/1202600.html

Remember  last week  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001731#hrw  when the sob sisters at Human Rights Watch were complaining that shaving terrorist prisoners to prevent head lice was an affront to Islam? Canada's National Post reports that ""the Taliban and al-Qaeda prisoners held at the U.S. military base here on Cuba's southern coast are being guarded partly by female Military Police officers, a shocking role reversal for Afghan fighters unaccustomed to taking orders from women."" We're all for this--in fact, if we had our druthers, all the guards would be women--but will Human Rights Watch object to this imposition on the prisoners' religion?

Skeeters in Reuterville  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020122/ts/attack_military_detainees_dc_2.html

Reuters, the wire service that thinks al Qaeda may be an organization of ""freedom fighters,"" reports on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's comments that the Gitmo prisoners aren't being mistreated. Reuters faults him because ""he did not mention the disease-carrying mosquitoes on the Caribbean island."" But hey, isn't one man's pest another's pet?

You Don't Say  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/22/opinion/22TUE2.html

An editorial in today's New York Times (link requires registration) observes that ""members of Al Qaeda military brigades . . . would have a hard time proving their organization's respect for the rules of war.""

Our Friends the Pakistanis  http://headlines.sify.com/496news1.html

The American Center in Calcutta, which sits 500 yards from the U.S. Consulate in that Indian city, has been attacked, probably by Pakistani-backed terrorists. Gunmen ""sprayed bullets indiscriminately"" this morning, killing four policemen and fleeing. Agence France-Presse reports that ""a Dubai-based criminal with links to Pakistani intelligence has said his outfit was responsible for Tuesday's shooting . . . and has threatened more attacks,"" according to an Indian Home Ministry official.

Our Friends the Pakistanis--II  http://www.newyorker.com/FACT/?020128fa_FACT

The New Yorker's Seymour Hersh reports on that Pakistani airlift from besieged Kunduz back in November. Hersh quotes Indian intelligence sources as saying that between 4,000 and 5,000 enemy men were unaccounted for when Kunduz fell. ""None of the American intelligence officials I spoke with were able to say with certainty how many Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were flown to safety, or may have escaped from Kunduz by other means.""

Arafat's Soldiers Shoot Jewish Pedestrians  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/22/LatestNews/LatestNews.42122.html

Tanzim, the military wing of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization, has claimed responsibility for a gunman's attack in Jerusalem that wounded at least 30 pedestrians. ""I saw him shoot two women and they fell,"" one witness tells the Jerusalem Post. Such heroes these Palestinians are.

Anthrax Lead Comes to Naught  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15970-2002Jan21.html

The Washington Post reports that ""the anthrax spores that went missing from the Army's top biological warfare laboratory in 1991 had been sterilized and could not have played a role in last fall's terrorism attacks.""

Somali Folly--II  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/01/22/blackhawk.screening/index.html

Yesterday  we noted  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001757#somali  that Somali-American leaders are calling for a boycott of "" Black Hawk Down  http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/blackhawkdown/ "" on the grounds that it depicts Somalis as ""savages."" CNN reports that a bootleg copy of the movie was screened in the Somali capital of Mogadishu, and the Somalis in the audience acted like, well, savages:

*** QUOTE ***

Audience members seemed to take delight in scenes of U.S. defeat. Each time an American chopper went down in the film, the audience cheered. Every time an American serviceman was killed, the audience cheered some more.

*** END QUOTE ***

Some of the Somali filmgoers didn't agree with the Somali-American complaints. ""As you can see, Somalis are brave fighters,"" one man told CNN. ""If the Americans come back to fight us, we shall defeat them again.""

The Bush Black Sheep  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=12207

Jimmy Carter had brother Billy; Ronald Reagan had Patti and the ballet-dancing son; Bill Clinton had brother Roger and brothers-in-law Hugh and Tony. With a Bush back in the White House, it seemed, we'd be spared the embarrassing presidential relations--and for the first year we were. (We don't count Jenna and Barbara's tippling troubles as an embarrassment; trying a drink is a perfectly wholesome, even if not strictly legal, thing for a teenager to do.)

Alas, President Bush's brother Neil, who you may dimly remember as a figure in a failed savings-and-loan a decade or so ago, has emerged to embarrass the man in the White House. The Arab News reports Neil was in Saudi Arabia yesterday, urging Arabs to undertake ""a sustained lobbying and PR effort"" to counter ""the US media campaign against the interests of Arabs and Muslims."" Neil also identified himself as part of the root-cause crowd: ""There could be economic disparities, social unrest or unemployment causing growing dissatisfaction in the region. But I have been told that the bigger issue is the resolving of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."" Oh brother.

If Only We Had Ways of Making Him Not Talk  http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/01/22/ED5329.DTL

Alan Dershowitz has been urging the legalization of torture as a means of extracting information from terror suspects. In a San Francisco Chronicle op-ed, he says judges should be able to issue ""torture warrants"":

*** QUOTE ***

The suspect would be given immunity from prosecution based on information elicited by the torture. The warrant would limit the torture to nonlethal means, such as sterile needles, being inserted beneath the nails to cause excruciating pain without endangering life.

*** END QUOTE ***

Some people have expressed surprise that this generally liberal law prof should be endorsing such a plan. But any of us who've endured a Dershowitz TV appearance know that he not only approves of torture, he's quite good at inflicting it himself.

Rappers for America  http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/story/0,3604,637224,00.html

London's Guardian reports that rap music--once a genre whose politics consisted mostly of violent opposition to authority--has become patriotic in the wake of Sept. 11. Early-'90s rapper MC Hammer once favored bland, apolitical lyrics, but no more:

*** QUOTE ***

A former marine, Hammer poses in front of the stars and stripes on the cover of his comeback album, Active Duty, and has been popping up on US television to fly the proverbial flag in his new, and bogus, role of unofficial spokesperson for hip-hop.

Marxist duo the Coup have not been so fortunate. Since hitting the headlines last September, when they had to withdraw unintentionally prophetic album artwork depicting the twin towers exploding, they have become the music industry's loudest dissenters. They announced that anybody wearing the flag, which they described as ""violent gang colours"", would not be admitted to their shows. Predictably, they have not had quite as many invitations to appear on TV as Hammer, and they recently accused magazines such as Rolling Stone of diluting their statements to make them more palatable.

Crucially, though, the Coup and the handful of other anti-war rappers sell relatively little, and to a predominately white, liberal fanbase, a sub-genre known as backpacker hip-hop.

*** END QUOTE ***

'Groundhog Day': The Remake  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,62-2002032543,00.html

In an interview with the Times of London, film director Robert Altman sounds off on politics:

*** QUOTE ***

""This present government in America I just find disgusting, the idea that George Bush could run a baseball team successfully--he can't even speak! I just find him an embarrassment. I was over here when the election was on and I couldn't believe it--and I'm 76 years old. Then when the Supreme Court came in and turned out to be a totally political animal, the last shred of any naivety that was left in me has gone. When I see an American flag flying, it's a joke.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Altman adds: ""If you asked would I live in London the rest of my life, yeah, I'd be very happy to stay here. There's nothing in America that I would miss at all."" Hmm,  haven't we heard this before?  http://www.salon.com/people/feature/2000/09/20/starexile/index.html

Stupidity Watch

Ah, what a bountiful harvest of imbecility we have today. First off is  Sandy Tolan  http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/2002/01/20/ncguest1.htm , an ""independent journalist and radio documentary producer"" who penned a USA Today column denouncing the media for being too patriotic. She's critical of journalists who think the Pentagon would tell the truth, but she's all for dubious sources--as long as they're anti-American:

*** QUOTE ***

Take the case of civilian deaths from the bombings in Afghanistan. A careful reading of American newspapers finds repeated instances in which dozens, even hundreds, of civilians have been killed by U.S. bombs. A University of New Hampshire professor, culling reports from the front, estimates the total death toll at more than 4,000. If true, this exceeds the number killed here on Sept. 11.

Yet, the stories coming from Afghanistan are largely of liberation and chaotic joy. The bombings are often covered as ""collateral"" damage that ""happens in war."" Other times, Pentagon denials coming out of Washington are given equal credibility with eyewitness reports from anti-Taliban villagers on the ground; the story dissolves into a false balance of he-said, she-said. Unlike in Europe, the U.S. press rarely focuses on the growing rage over bombs falling on civilians. It's as if such rage doesn't exist.

But how else do we explain that, in early December, the British journalist Robert Fisk was nearly beaten to death by bombed-out Afghan refugees just inside the Pakistani border? Their fury led Fisk to conclude, in a courageous piece filed shortly after escaping with his life, that had he been in their position, ""I would have done just what they did. I would have attacked Robert Fisk. Or any other Westerner I could find.""

*** END QUOTE ***

The New Hampshire "" study  http://www.cursor.org/stories/civilian_deaths.htm "" she cites is pure junk science; it bases its conclusions on such sources of ""information"" as the pro-Islamist al-Jazeera news network. (In any case, even honest efforts to count large numbers of casualties are difficult; remember when 7,000 people had died at the World Trade Center?) As for Fisk, she accepts at face value this notoriously anti-American writer's ideologically self-serving interpretation of his beating, which, as  we noted  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001580#fisk , sounded to us like a simple robbery attempt.

Speaking of  Robert Fisk  http://argument.independent.co.uk/commentators/story.jsp?story=115680 , here's a whopper from his latest column in the Independent:

*** QUOTE ***

Minus the torture, the United States is now doing what most Arab regimes have been doing for decades: arresting their brutal ""Islamist"" enemies, holding them incommunicado, chained and hooded, while preparing unfair trials.

*** END QUOTE ***

Yeah, well, minus the brains, this Fisk is a regular Einstein, isn't he?

In London's Evening Standard,  A.N. Wilson  http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/dynamic/news/top_story.html?in_review_id=490218&in_review_text_id=447954  weighs in with what starts out as a rant against the ""inhumane"" treatment of the Gitmo prisoners and turns into a rant against anything and everything American:

*** QUOTE ***

These stories and pictures horrify us, but they should not surprise us. The Bush administration, and its European defenders, are not concerned to spread abroad Christianity, or the enlightenment virtues of the American founding fathers. They are not Jeffersons or Benjamin Franklins concerned with liberty or human dignity. They are the most merciless exponents of world capitalism, with the determination to have a McDonald's and a Starbucks (with all that this ""globalised"" economy implies) in every country on earth. They are the forces of Big Money, not the representatives of Good Ol' Uncle Sam.

*** END QUOTE ***

The new-economy mag Fast Company features an interview with  William Ian Miller  http://www.fastcompany.com/online/55/courage.html , author of a book on courage. Only neither Miller nor interviewer Harriet Rubin seems to have a clue as to what courage is. ""If I had a wish,"" says Miller, ""it would be never to be scared, never to feel the shame of being scared."" In truth, courage consists not in the absence of fear--fear in the face of danger is a natural and healthy instinct--but in the overcoming of fear. It turns out, though, that Miller has a political agenda:

*** QUOTE ***

It's terrible how little courage our leaders have. Rudy Giuliani did the right thing on September 11. He stood out like a sore thumb. Where was the president? He was in Nebraska--and his people were putting out false reports that he was under threat. Giuliani manifested courage. He put his body on the line, even though he could have been killed in the collapse of WTC Tower 2. . . . Tony Blair is doing more to deal with terrorism than our own president.

*** END QUOTE ***

Well, cheers for Rudy and Tony, but it's ridiculous to downplay the efforts of President Bush, who is unquestionably the leader of the war. Moreover, Miller seems unaware that Air Force One went to Nebraska at the urging of the Secret Service, and it was Bush who insisted on returning to Washington on the night of Sept. 11.

"" The Simpsons  http://www.thesimpsons.com/index.html "" has had a brilliant run, more than a dozen years, but we're ready to predict that it will end within a season or two. The problem is, real life has become so ridiculous, it's hard for a cartoon to be any funnier. A case in point: This past Sunday, ""The Simpsons"" aired a new episode in which Marge, shocked to learn that Springfield is the fattest town in America, hires a lawyer to sue ""big sugar."" Two days later (that is to say, today) ABC had a similar story--but this was an  ABC  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20020122/ts/obesityblame020122_1.html   News  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20020122/ts/obesityblame020122_1.html  story:

""There is a movement afoot to do something about the obesity problem, not just as a visual blight but to see it in terms of costs,"" says John Banzhaf, a George Washington University Law School professor.

Most public health experts agree that regulations or taxes would be better than legal action, but they are mindful that after years of going after Big Tobacco, anti-smoking forces only achieved success when plaintiffs and lawyers stepped in.

*** END QUOTE ***

We've had lawsuits against the tobacco industry and the gun industry, and it looks like the food industry is going to be next. What other ridiculous causes can the plaintiffs lawyers take up? If you have a suggestion, write us at  opinionjournal@wsj.com  mailto:opinionjournal@wsj.com . If it's witty enough, we'll use it--and who knows, maybe we'll come up with enough ideas to save ""'The Simpsons.""

People's Republic of Massachusetts  http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/021/metro/For_some_a_word_weighs_heavily+.shtml

Boston's Mayor Thomas Menino has vetoed a measure passed by the City Council that would ban the word minority in all city business. The vote was unanimous, as presumably all votes will have to be if the council overrides the veto, since a nonunanimous measure would pass over the objections of a you-know-what. Hmm, votes were always unanimous in communist countries too. Now we know why they call it the ""People's Republic of Massachusetts."" The Boston Globe adds:

As Boston steps into the forefront of a growing debate over whether the word has the outdated ring of ""Negro,"" ""Oriental,"" ""Spanish,"" and ""Eskimo,"" there's discord over which replacement term to use.

""Spanish"" is outdated? So what do Bostonians call a visitor from Madrid?

Global Warming on the Rocks  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/abc/20020118/ts/ice020117_1.html

The global-warming industry is desperately trying to spin itself out of the revelation that temperatures in Antarctica have actually been getting lower. ABC News quotes geologist Ian Joughin as saying: ""There's no question that some parts of Antarctica are warming. But it could be this part of the ice sheet is not necessarily sensitive to global warming.""

If this is true, scientists ought to be studying that ice to find out just what makes it ""insensitive to global warming."" This could have profound technological consequences. At the very least, heat-resistant ice would be a great boon to those of us who like to sip our scotch on the rocks slowly.

"Update to Bus Pass Information","
Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as ""taxable"" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as ""imputed tax"". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

"IDEAadvisor Top10 - Price Reduction","Independent Equity Analysis
from IDEAadvisor

In case you missed it the first time around, here it is again. The same list published on
January 18th 2002 is now available at 40% of the original price. For a one-time charge
of only $19 you can purchase IDEA's Top 10 Stock Picks. That's less than $2 per stock
recommendation. Offer valid till February 18, 2002

http://adserver.freerealtime.com/frt-offers-409a.ad

IDEA's Top 10 Stock Picks looks at 10 stocks we believe will be strong performers in
2002 and beyond -- not just from a stock growth perspective, but also as representing
companies that will lead their respective sectors and industries. Market conditions early
in 2002 are bound to be volatile, and we have chosen the stocks we believe are both fairly
valued and offer stable growth.

In our last major recommended list, released on September 28, 2001, we listed 13
stocks that we felt traded at price-to-free cash flow discounts to the market. The first nine
names on the list we noted for also carrying a higher dividend than the average S&P 500
company at 1.5% at that time; the last four we noted for their exceptionally low multiples
of price-to-free cash flow. And while emphasizing stability over growth in a time of
tremendous market uncertainty, we managed to pick 13 stocks which have yielded an
average return of almost 28% in less than four months (versus 10% growth in the S&P
500 over the same period).

http://adserver.freerealtime.com/frt-offers-409b.ad

Still not convinced? Why not SAMPLE an older Recommended List!  Our next list will
be available for Pay Per View purchase in Quarter 2, 2002.

<p><b>Enron investigations are</b> going strong in Washington.  On
Thursday, we'll watch the <b>closed-door meeting between Congressional
investigators and the former Andersen auditor</b> who handled the Enron
account.  Andersen fired <b>David Duncan</b> on Tuesday for destroying
documents, and now <b>Duncan is said to be cooperating with the House
Energy and Commerce Committee investigation</b>.
<p><b>Congress returns next week</b> and on Thursday we'll bring you
updates from our Washington bureau on the <b>debate to come in 2002 over
energy emissions policy</b>.  We'll also have details on <b>a new report
to be released tomorrow</b> in Washington that <b>could impact the
emissions debate</b>.
<p>Finally from Washington, Correspondent Alison Kosik will take us for
a test drive on the highly anticipated <b>Segway Human Transporter</b>.
Alison will give us the inside scoop on an <b>invention that some people
believe could hold major implications for the energy sector</b>.
<p><b>Lawsuits continue to fly at Enron</b> - the Houston bureau will
have a report on the most <b>current suit representing more than 30,000
Houston area teachers</b>.  We'll hear from the attorney representing
them, <b>Fleming & Associates' Sean Jez</b>, from the bureau on
Thursday.
<p>A new <b>nonprofit organization</b> in Houston is <b>helping new
businesses being formed by ex-Enron employees</b>.  On Thursday from the
Houston bureau, <b>Resource Alliance Group Executive Director John
Elder</b> will join us to talk about the group.  Catch Elder during the
10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.
<p>The Houston bureau will also bring us a <b>report on an ERCOT
workshop</b> being held in Houston on Thursday.  <b>Henwood Energy
Services is hosting the workshop</b>, which will address the
<b>implications of overcapacity for power portfolio strategy and
results</b>.
<p><b>Raymond James & Associates Senior Energy Analyst Jon
Cartwright</b> talks to ENL's Kym McNicholas about <b>Calpine's new
capital expenditures plan and lowered earnings projections for 2002</b>.

Best of the Web Today - January 21, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Left-Wing Rag or Right-Wing Gag?

On Friday, acting on a tip from reader Gregory Brunt, we noted that The Nation had published an article on its Web site by  Matt Bivens  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#matt , the very first sentence of which contained a major factual error:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Houston Astros and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

Bush, of course, was part-owner of the Texas Rangers, not the Astros. Almost immediately after we published Friday's column, The Nation fixed the error. Or at least it tried. As  The Weekly Standard  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/000/804gwezk.asp  notes, here's how the modified sentence read:

*** QUOTE ***

When George W. Bush co-owned the Texas Rangers and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

Alas for The Nation, this was no more accurate.  Enron Field  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/national/bpkaus.htm  is where the Astros play; the Rangers' home is the  Ballpark in Arlington  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/bpkarl.htm , which has no corporate sponsor. Bivens also screwed up the chronology. Bush sold his interest in the Rangers in 1998; Enron bought naming rights to the Astros' new stadium in 1999. So an accurate version of Bivens's lead would have read:

*** QUOTE ***

A year after George W. Bush sold his interest in the Texas Rangers, construction began on a new stadium for the Houston Astros, and Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the latter team's park after Enron.

*** END QUOTE ***

That, of course, does not reflect badly--or indeed, in any way at all--on President Bush, though the incident reflects terribly on the bush-league journalism they practice at The Nation. Apparently the magazine's editors agree; by Saturday afternoon the Bivens piece had disappeared from their Web site (though the  modified version  http://www.thenation.com/cgi-bin/htsearch?config=&restrict=&exclude=&method=and&format=builtin-long&sort=score&words=houston+astros  still shows up in The Nation's search engine).

We all make mistakes, but this is only the latest in a string of staggeringly stupid stumbles by Nation editors and writers that we've chronicled in recent months:
- Katrina vanden Heuvel  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000919#katrina , editor-in-chief of this political magazine, appeared on national television and could not name her own congressman.
-Columnist  Eric Alterman  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000740#eric  apparently borrowed a phrase from George Will in 1989--then, 12 years later, accused Will of plagiarizing him.
-Just two weeks after Sept. 11, columnist  Katha Pollitt  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001214#katha  wrote a piece in which she boasted of her contempt for the American flag.

How could anyone be this dumb? Well, remember David Brock? Back in the early '90s he was the star reporter for The American Spectator, a conservative magazine. He turned out to be a liberal saboteur, and, as erstwhile Spectatorian  Byron York  http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/11/york.htm  reported recently in The Atlantic Monthly, he ended up all but destroying the Spectator. Is it possible that The Nation, that venerable left-wing magazine, has been infiltrated by right-wing moles who are acting like idiots in an effort to discredit the left?

We'd like to go on the record opposing this kind of deception. If vanden Heuvel, Alterman, Pollitt, et al. really are right-wingers, they should come clean and engage their ideological opponents in an honest debate. This sort of deception is juvenile and contemptible, and it's especially inappropriate now. After all, there's a war on.

noted Thursday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001739#krugman  a curious report in the New York Times that Times columnist Paul Krugman had once received $50,000 for serving on an Enron ""advisory board.""  Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  smells scandal. But he's overreacting. Based on what we know so far, Krugman's conduct looks foolish but not unethical.

Sullivan has done a manful job of trying to come up with an ethical transgression, unearthing an article Krugman wrote for  Fortune  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/eman.html  while still on the Enron payroll in 1999. It's a puff piece on Enron, and it stands in sharp contrast with Krugman's current views on the subject, most notably  his column of last Friday  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/18/opinion/18KRUG.html  (Times links require registration), in which he rails against the company as a symbol of the corruption of American capitalism.

But whatever the merits of Krugman's views, before or after the turn of the century, he does seem to have complied with the rules of journalistic ethics. He disclosed his relationship with Enron in the Fortune piece and again in a  January 2001 Times column  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24KRUG.html . When he joined the Times as a columnist in 1999, he gave up the Enron gig, as the Times' conflict-of-interest policy requires.

Sullivan thinks Krugman should also have disclosed the amount of his fee, for ""being on an advisory board need not be a source of payment."" This seems an exceedingly picayune point, especially for someone who styles himself the scourge of "" gotcha journalism  http://thenewrepublic.com/070901/trb070901.html ."" Does anyone serve on an advisory board for a for-profit company without compensation? In any case, Sullivan's beef here ought to be not with Krugman but with his editors at Fortune and the Times, who surely knew enough to ask about the fee and insist on disclosure if they thought it necessary.

Krugman's own defense  http://www.wws.princeton.edu/%7Epkrugman/enron.html  is awfully, well, defensive, though at least his self-esteem seems healthy:

*** QUOTE ***

I was not an unknown college professor. On the contrary, I was a hot property, very much in demand as a speaker to business audiences: I was routinely offered as much as $50,000 to speak to investment banks and consulting firms. They thought I might tell them something useful. For what it's worth, Citibank officials said--you can check it out with a Nexis search--that a heads-up I gave them in 1996 about the risks of an Asian currency crisis saved them hundreds of millions of dollars.

*** END QUOTE ***

""Hot property"" or not, Krugman does look quite silly thumping his chest about "" crony capitalism  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/15/opinion/15KRUG.html "" when he himself has benefited from it and was cheering for today's villains less than three years ago. But being silly has never, as far as we know, disqualified anyone from writing a column for the New York Times.

Medal of Dishonor for America West  http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020119-79003878.htm

Joseph Foss got hassled by security guards at Phoenix's Sky Harbor International Airport last week. These days that's nothing unusual, but Foss is 86. He is a former governor of South Dakota and a retired Marine general. And what made the crack security staff for  America West  http://www.americawest.com/  suspicious was the Medal of Honor he earned in 1943 for his service in the Pacific theater.

""I was held up for 45 minutes, while they decided what to do about the medal,"" Foss tells the Washington Times. ""I almost missed my flight, as they went back and forth."" Foss earned the medal for shooting down 26 enemy planes. Good thing he didn't tell the guards that, or they'd never have let him fly.

Yasser, That's the Ticket--III  http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=119598

Secretary of State Colin Powell ""made a renewed demand on Sunday that Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat explain the arms shipment intercepted by the [Israeli Defense Force] in the Red Sea on January 3,"" the Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz reports. Pretty tough talk, there, Colin. What'll he do next, threaten to hold his breath until Yasser fesses up?

Actually, Arafat has an explanation: ""The Karine A was operated by an Israeli company importing building materials from Romania,"" Arafat told Egyptian television, according to the  Jerusalem Post  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/20/LatestNews/LatestNews.41965.html . In the Saudi daily  Arab News  http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=12130 , meanwhile, Abdul Rahman Al-Rashid offers this advice for the Palestinian Arab strongman:

*** QUOTE ***

Arafat should have handled the issue as the former American President Bill Clinton did regarding his involvement with Monica Levinsky [sic]. While admitting that he had some kind of relationship with the girl, Clinton denied having had illicit relations with her. Thus he brought half the issue under control. He did not deny all the charges but neither did he tell the whole truth.

*** END QUOTE ***

OK, guys, these are improving--but  our readers' explanations  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/jtaranto/?id=95001721  are still funnier.

Where's Churchill When You Need Him?  http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/page.cfm?objectid=11553940&method=full

It's just sad to see what's happened to the British. The orgy of vulgar sentimentality after Princess Diana's death a few years back made us suspect that the land of the stiff upper lip had somehow turned into a nation of hysterical ninnies. Now we're sure of it, notwithstanding even Tony Blair's resolute support in the terror war.

The U.S. military released some photos of terrorist captives at Guamtanamo Bay--a group that apparently includes three British citizens--and the sob sisters in the British press went into a frenzy of outrage. The Mirror, a London-based tabloid, shrieks that the ""barbaric treatment"" of the prisoners ""is no more than a sick attempt to appeal to the worst red-neck prejudices."" That must be why they're getting bagels and cream cheese.

The folks at the  BBC  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1771000/1771687.stm  were more restrained, but the message was the same. In a dispatch last night titled ""Prison Camp Pictures Spark Protests,"" the network reports: ""The US Government has released photographs of the Taleban and al-Qaeda suspects held at its prison camp in Cuba which show them being subjected to sensory deprivation. . . . The chief medical officer of the human rights group, Amnesty International, Jim West, said the photographs were reminiscent of torture methods used in eastern Europe in the 1970s.""

A  BBC report  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1773000/1773143.stm  from this afternoon, however, tells a different story:

*** QUOTE ***

The three British al-Qaeda suspects being held at Camp X-Ray in Cuba have ""no complaints"" about their treatment, according to British officials who have seen them.

The three are in ""good physical health"" and are being treated well, they reported.

*** END QUOTE ***

Oh well, never mind.

Big Man on Campus  http://www.miami.com/herald/content/news/national/digdocs/106181.htm

The Miami Herald reports from Gitmo that ""a beefy, one-legged inmate tried to use Muslim prayer time to unite his fellow al Qaeda and Taliban prisoners."" Military police ""observed the prisoner facing the wrong way during Muslim prayer and chanting in Arabic what a linguist translated as, 'Be strong. Allah will save us.' "" Army Capt. Luis Hernandez ""described the one-legged prisoner as 'fat and strong' while 'the little kids are coming very skinny.' ""

Onward? Not This Christian Soldier.  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk_politics/newsid_1771000/1771086.stm

Rowan Williams, the archbishop of Wales, is denouncing the war on terrorism as ""tainted."" In an essay reprinted in today's  Guardian  http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,636690,00.html , he suggests that the American campaign in Afghanistan is morally equivalent to the attack on the World Trade Center:

*** QUOTE ***

It is just possible to deplore civilian casualties and retain moral credibility when an action is clearly focused and its goals are on the way to evident achievement. It is not possible when the strategy appears confused and political leaders talk about a ""war"" that may last years. And there is a fine line between, for example, the crippling of military and aircraft installations and the devastating of an infrastructure with a half-formed aim of destroying morale. Combine that with the use of anti-personnel weapons such as cluster bombs, which ought to raise some serious questions (they have been described as aerial landmines in terms of their randomly lethal character), and the whole enterprise is tainted.

Tainted, because as soon as assaults on public morale by allowing random killing as a matter of calculated policy become part of a military strategy, we are at once vulnerable to the charge that there is no moral difference in kind between our military action and the terror that it attacks.

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams is not so much turning the other cheek as being two-faced. He tells the  Telegraph  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/21/narch21.xml  that he didn't really mean that America is guilty of terrorism:

*** QUOTE ***

The 51-year-old Primate of Wales agreed that terrorism was an evil that had to be rooted out, but said: ""I don't think you root out terrorism by reproducing its methods. And that's always the danger if we respond in some ways hastily.

""I didn't say that the American campaign was morally equivalent to terrorism, just that there were certain possible tactics in that campaign which would leave them open to that charge.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Williams also writes (in a passage quoted by the Telegraph but not reprinted in the Guardian) that he was near ground zero on Sept. 11, and ""I know just a little of what it is like for so many human beings--Israelis and Palestinians now, and Iraqis a few years ago."" How about Americans?

Anthrax Breakthrough?  http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/21/anthrax.probe/index.html

""Investigators appear to be on the verge of cracking the genetic sequencing of the anthrax strain that has killed five Americans since the fall,"" CNN reports. ""Discovering the genetic sequencing could reveal the age of the deadly strain sent in the letters and may lead investigators to the laboratory or laboratories where it was produced, sources said.""
 
The  Hartford Courant  http://www.ctnow.com/news/specials/hc-detrick0120.artjan20.story?coll=hc-headlines-home  reports that anthrax specimens disappeared from the Army's biological- warfare research facility at Fort Detrick, Md., in the early 1990s, ""during a turbulent period of labor complaints and recriminations among rival scientists there."" A 1992 Army inquiry ""found evidence that someone was secretly entering a lab late at night to conduct unauthorized research, apparently involving anthrax. A numerical counter on a piece of lab equipment had been rolled back to hide work done by the mystery researcher, who left the misspelled label 'antrax' in the machine's electronic memory, according to the documents obtained by The Courant.""

The Courant adds that ""Fort Detrick is believed to be the original source of the Ames strain of anthrax used in the mail attacks last fall.""

Huh?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9869-2002Jan20.html

Bill Clinton was in Saudi Arabia over the weekend, and the Washington Post reports he weighed in against withdrawing U.S. troops from the corrupt and repressive kingdom. The Post's report contains three quotes from the peripatetic past prez:

*** QUOTE ***

""There are not so many [U.S. military] people here as to constitute a sort of occupation or anything like that. That's not the purpose of it.""

""It is correct to say it is not just in this region. We have systems in the military. We review everything every four years and then they [the Saudis] have systems within every four-year period to review other things.""

""Look at our forces in Asia and even in Latin America. It is a function of what we might be asked to do and being able to do it by having some people there physically present.""

*** END QUOTE ***

These quotes are remarkable, of course, for the absence of first-person singular pronouns. But can anyone figure out what the heck Clinton is saying?

Somali Folly  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020118/en/black_hawk_down_boycott_1.html

Somali-American ""community leaders"" in Minneapolis--home of America's biggest concentration of Somali immigrants--are calling for a boycott of "" Black Hawk Down  http://www.spe.sony.com/movies/blackhawkdown/ ,"" ""charging the new movie depicts their African homeland's people as savages and could create a backlash against refugees who fled to the United States,"" the Associated Press reports.

""The Somali people are depicted as very savage beasts without any human element,"" Omar Jamal of the St. Paul-based Somali Justice Advocacy Center, tells the AP. ""I's just people shooting each other.''

People shooting each other? In a war movie? This is shocking! It's not totally unheard of, though. A few years ago, we went to see ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and it, too, featured people shooting each other. How come German-Americans didn't boycott?

Stupidity Watch  http://www.industryclick.com/magazinearticle.asp?magazineid=17&releaseid=9774&magazinearticleid=138367&siteid=5

National Hog Farmer (""The Pork Business Authority"") reports that RFK's son has gone off the deep end:

*** QUOTE ***

In the mind of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., corporate pork production is a greater threat to American life and liberty than terrorist Osama bin Laden.

""This threat is greater than that in Afghanistan,"" says Kennedy. ""This is not only a threat to the environment, it is a threat to the American economy and democracy.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Kennedy told a crowd of ""anti-agriculture activists and college students"" that ""closing the last family farm is like tearing out the last pages of the last Bible, Torah or Talmud."" Why, we wonder, didn't he mention the Koran?

Several readers took issue with our  Friday smiting  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#stupidity  of Paul Campos over his phrase tofu Taliban. We take the point, which Jeff Arnett put best:

*** QUOTE ***

While I generally concur with you when you identify the overzealous and wrongheaded among us who compare the tactics of the murderous Taliban to irritating but otherwise rather innocuous behaviors, I think a little context is sometimes in order.

You describe Paul Campos's little diatribe as ""preposterously overwrought."" If he were being totally serious, I'd agree. But it seems in this more tongue-in-cheek context, the humor he's injected makes this comparison no more egregious than the infamous ""Soup Nazi"" character from the old Seinfeld television series: a metaphor that everyone understood was never meant to be taken literally, so it was perceived as hysterically funny at the time.

Have things changed so much that we've lost our sense of humor? If so, perhaps the terrorists have won . . . heh, heh, heh!

*** END QUOTE ***

This House Isn't a Home
In a  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001749#notnice , we got Robin Cook's title wrong. He is Britain's leader of the house, not home secretary.

This Army Isn't an Army  http://www.oaklandtribune.com/Stories/0,1002,1865%257E343418%257E82%257E,00.html

""Attorneys Seek Bail for Ex-SLA Soldiers,"" reads a headline in Friday's Oakland (Calif.) Tribune. Apparently the folks at the Trib think the Symbionese Liberation Army was an actual army, rather than a terrorist organization.

""If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation.""-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

""The current recession comes on top of a nationwide backlash against the homeless, who, even as their numbers grow to alarming new levels, face diminished forms of public relief and a multitude of laws against panhandling and living on the streets. So it is a pleasure to announce that the homeless, who have so little else, have at least gained, in Kenneth L. Kusmer's excellent 'Down and Out, On the Road,' a history of their own.""-- Barbara Ehrenreich  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/books/review/20EHRENRT.html , New York Times book review (link requires registration), Jan. 20, 2002

"Just Released: TOP 10 Stocks for 2002","Dear Investor,

I've just put the finishing touches on my annual list
of ""PROFIT ROCKETS"" for my Investor's World clients
and thought you might want a peek, as well.

In fact, you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple
mouse-clicks -- and 100% RISK-FREE, as well.  Since I
first issued this annual forecast back in 1995, my
clients have really cleaned up -- shouldn't you make a
pile of money this year, too?

From the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001,
this annual portfolio of ""Profit Rockets"" has racked
up a cumulative gain of 287.5%!  That's over a seven-
year period.  Do the division yourself and see how it
looks.  NOT BAD!  And that time period includes the
worst bear market of the last 25 years!

OF COURSE, it helps that we were actually UP another
14% in 2001 -- and that's over the whole year, not
some ""after October 1st"" rosy look at our holdings.
How many investment advisors can back up that claim?

I've been publishing my Investor's World newsletter
for 20 years now, but I first started making this
""annual forecast"" in 1995 as a regular panelist on
Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser.

IN 1995, I was #1 among over 20 world-class investors
with gains of 63.3% -- as audited by Bloomberg.  In
1996, I ""slipped"" to #2.  And in 1999, I just missed
out on top honors with a NICE FAT 60.4% GAIN.

And remember, we didn't earn those profits with
dangerous bets on dot.coms and the like.  That's not
what we do at Investor's World.  Our motto?  You NEVER
have to take big risks to make a whole lot of money.

HERE'S SOMETHING I think you'll really like: My picks
aren't some risky all-tech, all-the-time crapshoot.
The companies I choose span a host of industries, but
they all have four things in common:

1. Financials that show a company solidly in an upward
trend;
2. Management with a laser-like focus on improving the
bottom line;
3. Distinct competitive advantages within its market
niche;
4. And a stock price selling at the low end of its
usual trading range.

That's the only way to invest for low-risk, fortune-
building gains.

So if you're tired of investing dangerously -- but
still have a love for BIG PROFITS -- I hope you'll
give my Investor's World newsletter a RISK-FREE try.

After all, it's the ONLY WAY to get my 10 Profit
Rockets for 2002.  You see, I stopped giving out this
valuable information on nationwide TV a while back and
made it exclusive to my loyal newsletter readers.

I've been publishing specific recommendations for
individual investors like you since 1982 -- with many
thousands of happy clients.  That's because I've
displayed a knack -- if I may -- for finding great
companies flying under Wall Street's radar...and turning
that knack into BIG PROFITS like these:

*We bought Micron Technology back in 1988 when traders
beat it down because ""no American company could
compete with Japanese chip-makers.""  Yeah, right.  We
later BANKED 897% gains.

*SEI Corp was Wall Street's whipping boy when traders
hated financial stocks back in 1993.  We loaded up.
And our 1,952% gains so far have turned $20,000 into
more than $400,000.

*We invested in Glaxo -- now GlaxoSmithKline -- when
you couldn't give drug stocks away.  We're up 846% so
far, thanks to our intelligence early on.

AND I COULD TALK about more big winners, too -- like
British Petroleum (+809%), Mannesmann (+1,050%) and
Ahold (+2,828%) -- that we bought ahead of the
crowd...then watched with glee as everyone else piled
in.

Now today, I've just put the finishing touches on my
new PROFIT ROCKET Portfolio for 2002.  My clients are
chomping at the bit to get started.  And I hope you'll
join us for the BIG PROFITS ahead, as well.

You can try Investor's World for six full months RISK-
FREE.  Don't like what you see; don't make more money,
it doesn't cost you a dime.  Sign up now and you'll
IMMEDIATELY get my 2002 Profit Rocket portfolio
online.  And I'll even send you a selection of new,
wealth-building Special Reports, as well.

So please act now and make 2002 one of the best years
ever of your investing life.  Click here now:

Sincerely,

John P. Dessauer, Editor
Investor's World

P.S.  Remember, this is a 100% RISK-FREE offer.  If my
new ""Top 10"" list doesn't pique your interest -- or if
you're dissatisfied with my service for any reason --
you get every penny of your subscription cost back.
Best of all, this isn't some 30-day -- or even 90-day
-- guarantee.  It's good for six full months.

So don't MISS OUT on the profits ahead.  I expect many
of these stocks to rise 40%-to-50% or more in 2002.

JITTERS IN EUROPE

ITALY'S foreign minister, Renato Ruggiero, resigned after several other
senior ministers had made hostile remarks about the EU and the euro,
and Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, failed to slap them down.
Some European leaders feared Italy's government would turn
Eurosceptical. No way, said Mr Berlusconi, who took on the foreign
ministry himself. But it was clear Italy would defend its national
interests more strongly.

- - - - - See article: Will Italy really change its policy toward the European Union?
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRm0UBQN0T50qZS0Ap

Goran Persson, Sweden's prime minister, said his country might hold a
REFERENDUM ON THE EURO next year. Polls suggest that Swedish public
opinion, hitherto hostile, has recently swung in favour of joining the
single currency.

ESTONIA'S market-minded coalition government, led by Mart Laar,
collapsed.

FRANCE'S family doctors stayed on intermittent strike, amid increasing
signs that the government would surrender to their pay demands.

In SPAIN, government-imposed reforms to the country's universities came
formally into force, despite the protests of many academics and
students.

FORCE FOR PEACE

A British-led, UN-mandated, international force designed to provide
security in AFGHANISTAN, was gradually building up to a strength of
4,000-5,000. Turkey and Bulgaria were the latest countries to promise
soldiers. Meanwhile, America said that it intended to build a long-term
Central Asian base in Kirgizstan.

American forces took prisoner 364 men said to be members of the TALIBAN
or the al-Qaeda organisation and proposed to fly them to a camp in the
American base at Guantanamo in Cuba, for questioning. Afghan tribal
leaders protested at the deaths of civilians killed by American bombs,
said to outnumber the 3,000 people who died in New York on September
11th.

In an effort to please India, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan
dropped the term ""freedom fighters"" in a reference to attacks in
Indian-held KASHMIR and said he rejected all terrorism. But India
continued to build up its forces on its border with Pakistan.

- - - - - See article: Islam in Pakistan
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRm0UBQN0T50qZU0Ar

The Pakistani authorities found 630kg (1,390lb) of HEROIN being carried
by a camel caravan in the south-east of the country, one of the largest
seizures of the drug.

MYANMAR'S military government freed five opposition members, including
a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader.

A peace-making team from Norway arrived in SRI LANKA at the start of a
new effort to end the 18-year civil war between the separatist Tamil
Tigers and the government.

SHRINKING SURPLUS

As estimates of America's long-term fiscal surplus shrank, Tom Daschle,
the Democratic Senate majority leader, accused President George Bush of
MISHANDLING THE ECONOMY by pushing through last year's $1.35 trillion
tax cuts. Mr Bush promised that ""not over my dead body"" will the
Democrats raise taxes.

- - - - - See article: A battle over numbers
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRm0UBQN0T50qZW0At

The Supreme Court reduced the scope of the AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
ACT by ruling that an impairment must have a significant effect on a
person's daily life in order to qualify as a disability under the law.
The controversial ruling could make it harder for people with
afflictions such as carpal-tunnel syndrome (repetitive-strain injury)
to get special treatment from their employers.

The Bush administration said it may need to resume UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR
TESTING at some point to maintain the safety of its scaled-back
nuclear-weapons arsenal. The option would form part of the
""nuclear-posture review"", which outlines the country's justification
for reducing the number of strategic warheads by two-thirds over the
next ten years.

GOING DOWN

ARGENTINA devalued the peso by 29%25 for most trade and capital
transactions. For other purposes, the currency will float. Eduardo
Duhalde's government converted most dollar loans to pesos, but has said
dollar bank deposits will (eventually) be honoured. Critics feared that
the banking system would collapse.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRm0UBQN0T50qZX0Au

CHILE'S president, Ricardo Lagos, appointed as defence minister
Michelle Bachelet, a member of his Socialist party and the daughter of
an air-force general who died after being imprisoned and tortured
during General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. She is the first woman
defence minister in Latin America.

COLOMBIA'S three-year peace process came to a halt. President Andres
Pastrana gave the FARC guerrillas 48 hours to leave their
""demilitarised"" zone, after they had refused to drop their opposition
to military surveillance of the zone.

BY HOOK OR BY CROOK

ZIMBABWE'S PARLIAMENT was set to pass laws to prevent the presidential
election, due on March 9th and 10th, from being free or fair, or being
won by anyone other than Robert Mugabe. Making doubly sure, the army
chief hinted that he would not recognise the opposition candidate,
Morgan Tsvangirai, if he won.

- - - - - See article: Democracy, who needs it?
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRm0UBQN0T50qZZ0Aw

A senior aide to NIGERIA'S chief judge was found dead, apparently
murdered. Bola Ige, the justice minister, was murdered last month.

The South African government promised to set up a commission of inquiry
into the COLLAPSE OF THE RAND. The country's currency lost 37%25 of its
value last year. South African businessmen have accused speculators of
foul play.

The government of BURUNDI promised to pull troops out of Congo in
return for a Congolese promise to stop supporting rebels in Burundi.

After a three-week diminution in the violence between ISRAEL AND THE
PALESTINIANS, Israel seized a ship allegedly carrying weapons to
Palestinian militias, and two Hamas gunmen attacked an army base,
killing four Israeli soldiers before they themselves died.

"TECH ALERT: Microsoft, IBM, Nortel Post Results","__________________________________
TECHNOLOGY ALERT
from The Wall Street Journal


Jan. 17, 2002

MICROSOFT POSTED a decline in fiscal second-quarter profit, hurt by the weak
economy and a lawsuit-related charge. Revenue, however, rose 18% on strong
demand for its Windows XP operating system and Xbox game system.

IBM PROFIT slightly beat Wall Street expectations for the fourth quarter.
But the computer giant missed revenue targets amid weak PC and hardware
sales.

"FLASH ALERT: Don't fall for Technology's biggest LIE...","Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  I'll send it to you free when you
accept a FREE 30 day trial to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

That's right -- take a full 30 days to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  This free 30 day trial means my advisory
costs you nothing if you're not 100% satisfied with the
advice you receive.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic
is DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.

"Breaking Enron News !","ENRON ADMITS IT'S REALLY ARGENTINA
Now Massive Ineptitude, Corruption Make More Sense, Analysts Say
Houston, Texas - Collapsed due to gross mismanagement and insurmountable
debt, energy company Enron today confessed to what many observers had
long suspected: it is actually Argentina.
Congressional leaders, who have called for an investigation into the
biggest corporate failure in U.S. history , immediately dismissed
Enron's claim, but Argentinians weren't so sure. ""The shady deals. The
crazy debt. I knew there was something familiar about those guys,"" said
Banco del Argentina director Ernesto Caballo.
Enron chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay, speaking through an interpreter via
phone from Buenos Aires, apologized for any confusion the subterfuge may
have caused, and noted that as a sovereign nation, the company was
immune from U.S. prosecution. Lay also insisted that he had not ""fled""
to Argentina, but had returned home to the capital to visit ""mi
familia.""
While not directly stating it, Lay also hinted that he might in fact be
Argentinian President Fernando de la Rua. Reached in Buenos Aires, de la
Rua admitted he couldn't rule that out. ""Things are pretty crazy around
here. Who can say?""
But Enron creditors, clients, and shareholders, who stand to lose
billions over their exposure to the company, weren't buying any of it.
""While they may act like it, they are not a South American country, and
Ken Lay is not the President of Argentina,"" declared J.P. Morgan Chase
spokesman Alex Firtilly. ""They are a malfeasant U.S. corporation that
has potentially caused us to lose $500 million. And Ken Lay is from
Missouri.""
""?Como?,"" Lay replied. ""No hablo Ingles.""
Recently ranked as high as No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest
U.S. companies, Enron literally ran itself into the ground  by fudging
its books, making secretive deals that enriched company insiders, and
relying too heavily on debt. Though it was formed in 1986 with the
merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, Enron became Argentina
only recently, said Lay, ""on the advice of our attorneys.""
That counsel came none too soon. As a South American state, all pending
U.S. and European lawsuits are rendered harmless. And the company
escapes what had been a daily fusillade of scorn from its former home.
Indeed, much as the French were baffled by America's obsession with
President Clinton's sexual affairs, many South Americans say they don't
understand why Enron and its leaders have been vilified. As former
Colombian President Ernesto Samper explained: ""In the United States, you
look at corruption as an abomination We look at it as an art.""
EXTRADITION DENIED
The U.S. State Department has refused to recognize Enron as Argentina,
and a spokesman said the Bush administration has officially requested
the extradition of Lay and the officers who allegedly fled with him.
Argentina, however, denied the request, explaining that an entire
country cannot be extradited. And besides, they added, Lay had pledged
to help pay off the nation's $132 billion debt.
Asked where the bankrupt Enron got such a sum, Lay explained that after
proclaiming its nationhood status, the company had received an emergency
IMF loan. An IMF spokesman later confirmed the payment.
""From what we knew of their fiduciary practices, Enron appeared to have
all the hallmarks of a typical IMF fundee,"" said IMF communications
director Nestor Svingen. ""At first, we did balk when they asked for $232
billion, but when they explained that some of the money would go to
repay overdue IMF loans, we thought, 'Oh, that's all right then.'""
""Not that we actually expect to see any money from anyone,"" Svingen
added. ""It's just this little game we all play. Great fun if you like
numbers. Do you enjoy quadratic equations? I could do them all day.""
Asked what Enron/Argentina had pledged to do with the extra $100 billion
it requested, Svingen said the application had specified funding for
""civic infrastructure improvements.""
""That usually means the president is going to build a palace,"" Svingen
explained.

"Will you miss out again?","Dear Investor,

I guess you've been too busy to respond to my
invitation so far.  And that's a shame.

I've written several times, demonstrating the safest
way to make BIG PROFITS in this market.  I've offered
to let you try my investment advisory RISK-FREE.  And
most importantly, I've shown you exactly how my
clients and I are making a ton of money right now.

Sadly, you've missed out on some really nice gains --
but I'm hoping you'll join us before you miss any
more:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.  And
today -- after a slight pullback -- this generic drug-
maker has RISEN 62% since late March.  That's just
what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 103% since mid-
September!  That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits
I love best.

*You want to see strong growth in retail?  Check out
Best Buy.  The company is grabbing market share and
pumping up the profits -- in fact, it ""beat the
street"" again this quarter.  Wall Street LOVES a
winner.  The stock SOARED 151% in 2001!

*Conservative General Mills smashed through its all-
time high.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th --
the day after reporting earnings -- this stock closed
UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  That's why it rose a nice,
stomach-calming 32% for the year.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and
its stock is UP 27% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
362% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s, MPT
Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen years,
according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed 466%
gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent;
201% in Cisco.  All stocks we SOLD before they soured.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,

Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet! Now business is
booming again for this tech juggernaut, and it's time
to pile back in for our next round of  BIG fortune-
building gains.  Don't miss out this time.  Click here
to join me now:

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Don,  Crude hit a 27-month low of $17.15 on news that OPEC will not cut output without a simultaneous, significant production cut by non-OPEC producers.  Alaron Trading's Phil Flynn tells ENL crude prices could fall below the $10.00 mark in the near future. Unleaded hit 4840 and heating oil reached 5080 - levels not seen since June of 1999.  ENL's Stephanie Stanton will have the latest on all the commodities on Friday.   We'll have more on Friday surrounding the impasse between OPEC and independent producers as Fahnestock & Company Senior Energy Analyst Fadel Gheit joins us from the AMEX in New York.  Gheit will stop by at 9:00 a.m. ET.   Video Library Update: OPEC Secretary General Ali Rodriguez spoke with International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale on Thursday about OPEC's conditional output cut.  If you happened to miss the interview, jump into the Video Library to view the conversation in full.   In Washington on Thursday, Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK) threatened to tie up the Senate unless legislation to open Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling was brought up for vote.  The Washington bureau will take a look at what this move could mean to the debate over energy in Congress.   Emission legislation rears its head again on the Hill as Senator  James Jeffords (I-VT) continues his push for multi-pollutant legislation.  We'll see where Sen. Jeffords' bill stands and hear what President of the Business Council For Sustainable Energy Michael Marvin has to say about it during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast.   Finally from the Washington bureau, we'll have the latest on the  Bush administration's efforts to beef up homeland security. We'll show you some of the newest innovations from the Department of Energy's national laboratories to aid in the war against terrorists.    Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, one of the most successful businesses for trading chemicals over the web is  Chem-Match.  From the Houston bureau on Friday, she'll talk with  Chem-Match President Larry McAfee about a new alliance the company has with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   Anadarko continues to make headway in production, even in the wake of falling natural gas prices.  Houston Bureau Chief Myra Jolivet talks to Anadarko Vice President of Domestic Operations Rex Alman about production on Friday.   On Friday, the California Air Resources Board discusses new emissions standards for distributed generation technologies in California.  We'll bring you an update on the meeting from the West Coast bureau tomorrow.   Program Note: Don't miss Friday's edition of EnergyPulse with  Dr. Dennis O'Brien.   Site Update: Check out the Energy Jobs button and the Audio Only feature on ENL.    Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.    Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"FLASH ALERT: Don't fall for Technology's biggest LIE...","Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;
and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore
-- it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!

Please don't miss out.  You'll kick yourself big-time
if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times
Richer By 2007.  It's yours FREE, simply for accepting
a 100% RISK-FREE trial subscription to my TECHNOLOGY
INVESTING advisory.

TAKE a full six months to measure the value of my
advice for yourself.  Don't like what you see...don't
make the profits you want, just cancel, and your
subscription doesn't cost you a dime.   That's reason
enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right -- and
I'm staking my reputation and my own money on this
call -- you can double your money, at least, in 12
months...and make your fortune several times over in the
coming years.

Please don't miss out.  Give yourself a chance.  At
least take a look at TECHNOLOGY INVESTING to see what
you think.  Our unusual six-month guarantee of total
satisfaction means my advisory costs you nothing if
you don't 100% approve.

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 43% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic is
DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

Best of the Web Today - January 8, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Unlucky 1,300  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/08/wafg108.xml

A U.S. Army special-forces team code-named Tiger 03 ""was credited yesterday with the deaths of 1,300 Taliban and al-Qa'eda fighters and the destruction of more than 50 tanks and other pieces of heavy weaponry,"" London's Daily Telegraph reports. The Telegraph interviews several members of the unit--their full names are omitted pursuant to Army regulations--who describe working with the Northern Alliance:

*** QUOTE ***

Tiger 03 used its targeting expertise for the first time on Oct 28, on a Taliban defensive position near the deserted town of Zard Kammar in the north-east of Afghanistan.

A B-52 bomber following an infra-red designation beam dropped a full load of 2,000lb bombs in a direct hit on the Taliban bunkers.

""It lifted the whole top of the hill two feet in the air,"" Kevin said. ""Mark"", an engineering specialist with the unit, said: ""People were lining up and clapping when we got back to the [base].

""They were slapping us on the back. It seemed like the more accurate the bombing, the better they fed us.""

*** END QUOTE ***

""None of us expected to survive,"" says Kevin, ""but it went just about as perfectly as you could hope.""

Taliban Bank Run  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11095-2002Jan7.html

The Washington Post describes a scene at a Kandahar bank:

*** QUOTE ***

The mullah arrived at the Kandahar branch of Afghanistan's central bank during regular business hours, asked to see the manager, who was another mullah, and presented a check signed by a third, Mohammad Omar.

It was Oct. 16, nine days after the first U.S. bombs began falling on Afghanistan, and this dirt-poor country was once again embroiled in war. The mullah, a senior member of Omar's Taliban leadership, stayed only as long as it took to justify the abrupt withdrawal, open the safe in the basement and stuff $5 million in U.S. dollars and Pakistani rupees into a big burlap sack, two bank employees said today. The sack was then carried into a waiting Toyota Land Cruiser.

None of it has been seen since.

*** END QUOTE ***

Now we know how Mullah Omar was able to afford that nice motorcycle. But he may soon learn that there are substantial penalties for early withdrawal.
Yes, Ministers  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020108/ts/attack_dc_1284.html

While Mullah Omar is still on the lam, three top Taliban have surrendered. ""A spokesman for Kandahar governor Gul Agha said the ousted ministers of defense, justice, and mines and industry had given themselves up to authorities in Kandahar, the former southern stronghold of the Taliban,"" Reuters reports. You've gotta love those Orwellian ministry names. Under the Taliban, after all, there was no justice, very little industry and, as we've learned since Oct. 7, even less defense. They do have mines, though--at least assuming the minister's title refers to the exploding kind.

Oh, to Be in England  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2001570027-2002012248,00.html

""Fourteen British Muslims are being interrogated in secret by US intelligence agents who believe they were some of Osama bin Laden's most prized recruits,"" the Times of London reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Some being held captive in Afghanistan described how the British contingent had a private meeting with bin Laden just before the suicide attacks in America.

One of the men said that they first had selection tests in Pakistan, and then, shortly before September 11, they were moved to Khowst camp inside Afghanistan without any reason being given.

The man, who is being held in a Kabul prison, said that they were singled out for specialist training because they could only speak English and were taught sabotage and bomb-making techniques.

Appeasement for Fun and Profit  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/08/wchir08.xml

President Jacques Chirac of France is ""embroiled in new scandal"" after ""documents were printed allegedly showing that close aides received kickbacks from a ransom paid to release French hostages held in the Middle East,"" the Daily Telegraph reports:

*** QUOTE ***

M Chirac was prime minister in 1988 when five French hostages held by Islamic Jihad in Lebanon were released. . . . M Chirac and his then interior minister, Charles Pasqua, always insisted that no ransom was paid to free the hostages. But last month the affair was revived after an anonymous memo from the French intelligence service, DST, was sent to an investigating magistrate.

The note was published for the first time yesterday by the newspaper Le Monde. It not only suggests that the interior ministry ordered the ransom to be paid, but alleges that officials kept a substantial slice of it for themselves.

The ransom deal--thought to be almost &pound;2 million--was allegedly brokered between a Lebanese businessman and an aide to M Pasqua at the French interior ministry.

*** END QUOTE ***

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020114/usnews/14saudi.htm

U.S. News & World Report has another damning article on Saudi perfidy and corruption. Noting Riyadh's reluctance to cooperate with America's investigation of the Sept. 11 atrocities--though 15 of the 19 perpetrators were Saudi--the magazine explains:

*** QUOTE ***

One reason, high-level intelligence sources tell U.S. News, is that at least two Saudi princes had been paying, on behalf of the kingdom, what amounts to protection money to Osama bin Laden since 1995. In November of that year, a bomb at the Saudi National Guard headquarters in Riyadh killed several American military advisers who worked closely with the force. One source, a former senior Clinton administration official, said that the two princes, whose names have not been disclosed, began making payments to bin Laden soon after the bombing. The official added that Washington did not learn of the payments until at least two years later. ""There's no question they did buy protection from bin Laden,"" he says. ""The deal was, they would turn a blind eye to what he was doing elsewhere. 'You don't conduct operations here, and we won't disrupt them elsewhere.' ""

*** END QUOTE ***

The Saudis deny the charge. The magazine adds that ""the Washington-Riyadh relationship is marred by another problem"":

*** QUOTE ***

Over the past decade, the United States has sold Riyadh $33.5 billion in military hardware. That's more than Israel and Egypt combined have received. U.S. companies have also done billions of dollars in commercial business with the kingdom. According to well-placed Saudi sources and a review of several little-known lawsuits, Saudi agents and royalty often demand enormous commissions to accompany these deals. Ordinarily, the payment of such fees to secure contracts would constitute a violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. But prosecutors say bribery is one of the toughest charges to prove.

*** END QUOTE ***

South Asian Alliances  http://jang.com.pk/thenews/jan2002-daily/08-01-2002/main/main2.htm

Foreign powers are taking sides in the continuing India-Pakistan dispute. Pakistan's News International reports Beijing is strengthening its longtime alliance with Islamabad:

*** QUOTE ***

In a historic, but, unannounced development, the Peoples Republic of China sharply reduced a marked imbalance between the Indian and Pakistan Air Force by sending five ships--in a space of only 10 days late last month--loaded with cargo ranging from cartons of unassembled brand new combat aircraft and a variety of air force-related weapons and equipment to the port in Karachi, senior Pakistani officials confirmed.

Separately the Chinese government made a speedy delivery of spares and related equipment for Pakistan's strategic assets through Korakram highway, a little before the snow created major obstacles on this crucial communication line between Pakistan and China before Christmas. Pakistan's extensive missile defence system has been raised with an active support of the Chinese government.

India, meanwhile, is getting strong support from Israel. ""The world is not divided between East and West,"" Israel's Foreign Minister Shimon Peres  said Monday  http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow.asp?art_id=1729673309  after meeting with India's Home Minister L.K. Advani. ""The world has a new division now, the countries that harbor terrorism and the countries that fight terrorism."" Israel and India formed a joint antiterrorism commission in July 2000.

Paki Man Fever  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/08/international/asia/08INDI.html

Yesterday at the White House, President Bush discussed the Indian-Pakistani conflict: ""I don't believe the situation is defused yet,"" he said, ""but I do believe there is a way to do so, and we are working hard to convince both the Indians and the Pakis there's a way to deal with their problems without going to war.""

The New York Times (link requires registration) reports that ""Mr. Bush raised some eyebrows by using the term ""Pakis."" It is considered an ethnic slur in Britain, which has a large Pakistani immigrant population.""

Well, whose eyebrows exactly did Bush raise? The Times doesn't say. A clue, however, can be found in this Reuters dispatch:

*** QUOTE ***

Asad Hayauddin, spokesman at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, said he did not consider what Bush said to be an insult.

""I would give him the benefit of the doubt and say it was said in passing. In all fairness, I would say it's not a racial slur,"" he said.

He did, however, receive a number of phone calls from reporters seeking the embassy's reaction.

*** END QUOTE ***

The whole ""controversy,"" in other words, seems to have been an invention of the White House press corps.

At Least Dingell Didn't Have to Take Off His Scarf  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A13332-2002Jan8.html

The Council on American Islamic Relations, which the Associated Press describes as ""a civil rights organization,"" is ""demanding Northwest Airlines apologize for allegedly forcing a Muslim high school student to remove her head scarf at an airport security checkpoint."" CAIR makes the usual complaint of ""racial profiling"":

*** QUOTE ***

""For a Muslim woman to be forced to take off her headscarf in public is a violation of rights,"" wrote Hodan Hassan, a spokesman for the civil rights group. ""These women believe covering their hair in public--essential to being modest--is a mandate from God.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Once again, these guys are simply demanding special treatment for their coreligionists. If Muslims are so put-upon, how does CAIR explain what happened to Rep. John Dingell? The Washington Post's  Lloyd Grove  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11250-2002Jan7.html  reports that ""after his artificial hip set off a metal detector Saturday afternoon, the 75-year-old Michigan Democrat was ordered to pull down his pants at Reagan National Airport as he tried to board Northwest Airlines Flight 1417 to Detroit."" Dingell was taken to a side room and ordered to strip down to his boxer shorts.
Grove reports Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta, a former congressman, called Dingell to apologize. Dingell recounted: ""I said, 'Norm, I'm not asking for an apology. And I know we don't want any more events like September 11th. I don't want any special treatment. I don't want to be treated any better than anyone else, but I don't want to be treated any worse either.' ""

If only CAIR had Dingell's attitude.

Speaking of Pants . . .  http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/page1/ledger/157de09.html

Here's the funniest headline we've seen all year: ""Switch to Pants Proves Trying for Afghan Men.""

Good Sense Watch  http://www.motherjones.com/magazine/JF02/blaming.html

Sixties leftist Todd Gitlin has an excellent piece--in Mother Jones, of all places--denouncing the blame-America-first left:

*** QUOTE ***

In the wake of September 11 there erupted something more primal and reflexive than criticism: a kind of left-wing fundamentalism, a negative faith in America the ugly.

In this cartoon view of the world, there is nothing worse than American power--not the woman-enslaving Taliban, not an unrepentant Al Qaeda committed to killing civilians as they please--and America is nothing but a self-seeking bully. It does not face genuine dilemmas. It never has legitimate reason to do what it does. When its rulers' views command popularity, this can only be because the entire population has been brainwashed, or rendered moronic, or shares in its leaders' monstrous values. . . .

Generals, it's said, are always planning to fight the last war. But they're not alone in suffering from sentimentality, blindness, and mental laziness disguised as resolve. The one-eyed left helps no one when it mires itself in its own mirror-image myths. Breaking habits is desperately hard, but those who evade the difficulties in their purist positions and refuse to face all the mess and danger of reality only guarantee their bitter inconsequence.

""Notice that [President Bush] didn't say 'over my dead body' will the homeless--many of them actually employed in low-paying jobs--sleep in the snows of Minneapolis because the 'faith-based' as well as government shelters are short on funds.""-- Robert Scheer  http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-000001714jan08.column , Los Angeles Times, Jan. 8, 2002

Cartoon Journalism  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64846-2002Jan4.html

In a column on comic strips, Washington Post ombudsman Michael Getler may have revealed more than he meant to with this aside: ""Many reporters and editors don't pay much attention to the comics, except perhaps 'Doonesbury,' the Garry Trudeau strip that parallels the news and the journalistic pursuit of it.""

Right Said Paula  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/ap/20020107/en/cnn_zahn_1.html

Over the weekend CNN aired a promotional ad for anchorwoman Paula Zahn. The ad's narrator asked: ""Where can you find a morning news anchor who's provocative, super-smart [and] oh, yeah, just a little sexy?"" Yesterday CNN executives yanked the ad. ""It was a major blunder by our promotions department,"" said CNN chairman Walter Isaacson.
 
What's weird about this story is that the controversial part of the ad was the one claim that is indisputably accurate--that Zahn is ""just a little sexy."" The real outrage is that CNN would try to peddle her as ""super-smart."" This is, after all, the same Paula Zahn who, in her Fox News Channel days, managed to make a mockery of the Gary Condit story (!) by credulously presenting a  parade of ""psychics.""  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95000866#fox

Bottoms Up  http://web.northscape.com/content/gfherald/2002/01/05/news/RB105COL.htm

Up at the Grand Forks (N.D.) Herald, they're giving themselves a well-deserved pat on the back for winning the award for  bottom news story of 2001  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001644#bottom . Actually, we only nominated the Herald's  story  http://web.northscape.com/content/gfherald/2001/01/20/local/SF120HOSP.htm , on a two-year-old girl getting an appendectomy, as the story with the greatest world-wide insignificance. But since there were no other nominations, the Herald takes the prize. Herald columnist Ryan Bakken interviews the story's author, Steve Foss, now an assistant city editor at the Duluth (Minn.) News Tribune:

*** QUOTE ***

Initially, he was defensive, especially when one of the Herald's reporters (not me) e-mailed his dubious award to his Duluth reporting staff. You know, the people who write stories Foss assigns.

""I'm so happy the Wall Street Journal keeps its eyes on something like this. It made my day,"" Foss said, sarcasm dripping.

Foss' second impulse was to plead guilty.

""I had heard an appendectomy for a 2-year-old was unheard of and that she'd die if she didn't get one,"" Foss said. ""Well, it didn't turn out to be completely what I'd heard. But it was one of those days where we needed a story, so . . .""

*** END QUOTE ***

Bakken notes that the Herald won a Pulitzer Prize four years ago for its coverage of a catastrophic 1997 flood. He quotes Foss: ""This isn't a bad example of what happens at a community newspaper. You write some paltry stories and you can win a Pulitzer as well. At a community newspaper, you go from paltry to Pulitzer and everywhere in between.""

Well, lots of people have Pulitzers, but the bottom news story of the year--now that's something the Herald can really be proud of. It puts the paper in a class by itself.

<p><b>Former Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is scheduled to appear before two
separate Congressional committees</b> next week.  On Friday, we'll have
a <b>preview of Monday's testimony</b> and the <b>latest on the
investigation</b> itself from the Washington bureau.  We'll also take a
look at the impact the Enron situation is having on efforts in Congress
to repeal or amend the <b>Public Utility Holding Company Act</b>.
<p>We'll also have the <b>latest on emissions policy in Congress</b> on
Friday.  With the White House still waiting to release its own ideas on
possible changes in U.S. emissions rules, some in Congress are trying to
move their own legislation.  <b>President of Energy and Environmental
Analysis Joel Bluestein</b> will talk about where he thinks the debate
stands right now.  Bluestein will join us during the 2:00 p.m. ET
newscast tomorrow.
<p><b>South Texas College of Law Professor Bruce McGovern</b> will talk
about <b>shareholder lawsuits against Williams</b> from the Houston
bureau on Friday.  McGovern will also explain <b>how these lawsuits
compare to the lawsuits against Enron</b>.
<p>The Houston bureau will continue coverage of a <b>threatened strike
by oil workers</b>.  The <b>workers' union says it will strike at
midnight tonight if contract talks don't progress</b>.  We'll be
following this story that's <b>affecting thousands of workers involved
in Texas</b>.
<p>More earnings from the Houston bureau on Friday - <b>Varco
International CFO Joe Winkler</b> is stopping by the bureau to talk
about his <b>company's earnings report</b> during the 3:00 p.m. ET
newscast.
<p>Friday from the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas talks to
<b>Tuscarora Transmission Company Director of Marketing Greg
Galbraith</b> about the company's plans to <b>expand its gas pipeline
system to northern Nevada</b>, just granted by the FERC this week.
Galbraith will join us during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.
<p>From New York during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast, <b>Merrill Lynch
Director of Energy Research Michael Rothman</b> is penciled in.  He'll
talk about what would happen to the <b>oil markets</b> if the U.S. were
to pursue the expansion of a <b>war on terrorism</b>.

"For Subscribers Only","Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I'm about to reveal a BRAND-NEW wireless
recommendation to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited
about this opportunity that I want to share the
details with you, too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either -- these royalties get paid
on a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in
the following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research
and development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I reveal the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which gets released TOMORROW.

To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0VN135

recommendations.  Plus, your subscription will be

means if you're not completely satisfied within the
first 6 months, I'll refund every single penny you've

stock tomorrow for 50% gains in the next 12 months.

Best of the Web Today - January 18, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Gun Stops Gunman  http://www.msnbc.com/news/688939.asp

There was a shooting Wednesday at the Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Va. Peter Odighizuwa, a 43-year-old naturalized U.S. citizen from Nigeria who'd flunked out of school allegedly went on a rampage and killed a dean, a professor and a fellow student with a .380-caliber pistol. Three other students were injured.

But the presence of another gun on campus almost certainly saved lives. MSNBC reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Students ended the rampage by confronting and then tackling the gunman, officials said.

""We saw the shooter, stopped at my vehicle and got out my handgun and started to approach Peter,"" Tracy Bridges, who helped subdue the shooter with other students, said Thursday on NBC's ""Today"" show. ""At that time, Peter threw up his hands and threw his weapon down. Ted was the first person to have contact with Peter, and Peter hit him one time in the face, so there was a little bit of a struggle there.""

*** END QUOTE ***

The  Salt Lake Tribune  http://www.sltrib.com/2002/jan/01152002/utah/167639.htm  reports the Utah Legislature is considering repealing a rule that bans guns from the campuses of the Beehive State's nine state colleges and universities. In light of the Appalachian experience, allowing Utahns to carry legal, licensed concealed weapons on campus would seem an obviously good idea--but not to Bernie Machine, president of the University of Utah:

*** QUOTE ***

""Classrooms, libraries, dormitories and cafeterias are no place for lethal weapons,"" Machen told the panel of mostly pro-gun legislators. ""Their very presence would interfere with the essential functions of a university.""

Machen said the fear of guns could chill the open debate that is at the core of academic freedom, and he said the constitutional guarantee of free speech superseded any statute by the Legislature that could interfere with it.

*** END QUOTE ***

The Founding Fathers somehow didn't notice the threat the Second Amendment poses to the First. Guess Machen is just smarter than James Madison.

Bin Dyin'?  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/01/18/gen.musharraf.binladen/index.html

Pervez Musharraf is an amazing guy. Not only is he a general and the Pakistani president, he's also a doctor. Or at least he seems to think he's qualified to render a medical diagnosis. CNN reports:

*** QUOTE ***

Pakistan's president says he thinks Osama bin Laden is most likely dead because he has been unable to get treatment for his kidney disease.

""I think now, frankly, he is dead for the reason he is a patient, he is a kidney patient,"" Gen. Pervez Musharraf said on Friday in an interview with CNN.

*** END QUOTE ***

Snopes.com  http://snopes2.com/rumors/kidney.htm  has an item, dated Nov. 20, on rumors of Osama's kidney problems (which we  noted Nov. 1  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001404#kidney ). It deems the veracity of the reports ""undetermined."" We'd have to agree--unless, of course, Dr. Musharraf has personally examined him.

Saudi Saynoara  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64536-2002Jan17.html

""Saudi Arabia's rulers are increasingly uncomfortable with the U.S. military presence in their country and may soon ask that it end,"" the Washington Post reports, citing ""several Saudi sources."" The Saudis fret that ""the American presence has become a political liability in domestic politics and in the Arab world""--the Osama bin Laden position. Also, they're ""increasingly uncomfortable with a role in U.S. efforts to contain Saddam Hussein, and earlier ruled out use of Saudi territory as a base for bombing raids on Iraq.""

Well, that's OK. If the Saudis kick us out now, later we can use Iraq as a base for raids on Saudi Arabia. Or, as  InstaPundit.com  http://instapundit.blogspot.com/2002_01_13_instapundit_archive.html#8811980  puts it: ""Miserable cowards. Let's kick 'em out and give Arabia to Turkey.""

Abdullah Vents  http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm?id=661446265

Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz, the Saudi crown price, ""has vented his fury against Qatar's al-Jazeera satellite TV in front of fellow leaders of the Gulf Arab monarchies,"" Agence France-Presse reports, picking up a story from a Lebanese newspaper. ""He focused the attack on Al-Jazeera's coverage of the arrest of a Saudi princess in the United States for alleged 'enslavement' of an Indonesian maid, saying the TV station relied solely on the US media's version of events.""

Abdullah also accused al-Jazeera of serving as ""a platform"" for al Qaeda--an accurate charge, to be sure, but one that'd have more moral force if the Saudis were more helpful in fighting al Qaeda.

Karzai to Riyadh  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1767000/1767647.stm

Interim Afghan president Hamid Karzai is visiting Saudi Arabia in search of foreign aid, the BBC reports. This is a bit troubling; the Saudis have, after all, used subsidies to places like Pakistan as a way of spreading their fundamentalist Wahhabi brand of Islam.

Arab Attacks Young Jewish Girls   http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-me/2002/jan/17/011701595.html

A member of the Al Aqsa Brigades, a militia linked to Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yasser Arafat's Fatah organization, shot up a wedding hall in Israel where a girl was celebrating her bat mitzvah. Six people were killed, as was the gunman. The Associated Press reports the gunman was subdued when guest Moti Hasson threw a chair at him.

'They Are Not Nice People'  http://www.miami.com/herald/content/news/world/digdocs/099534.htm

Several of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay have ""have threatened in both English and Arabic 'to kill an American before they leave Guantanamo Bay,' "" the Miami Herald quotes the camp commander as saying. ""They are not nice people,"" adds the commander, Marine Brig. Gen. Michael Lehnert.

A  BBC report  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/americas/newsid_1767000/1767227.stm  carries the headline ""US Public Unmoved by Camp Conditions."" Can they blame us? The British home secretary, Robin Cook, however, is moved. Expressing tender concern for the three prisoners who claim to be British citizens--which, if true, would make them traitors--the softhearted Cook disputes Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's assurances that conditions are adequate. ""I am not sure I take Mr Rumsfeld's views as independent corroboration. He is a man of robust views,"" the  Telegraph  http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/18/wmart118.xml  quotes him as saying. He adds that Rumsfeld is ""not an independent voice. . . . He is not in the same category as the International Red Cross, which is independent.""

Clinton in Reuterville  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020118-67848731.htm

The Washington Times reports (third item) that a ""force penetration"" video guide, produced by the Army in 1998, ""lectured soldiers that terrorism was a relative term."" The Clinton-era video ""puts forth the notion that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, pointing out that French resistance fighters in World War II were terrorists because they blew up bridges during Nazi occupation.""

The report adds: ""The Army video is not just politically damaging. It is expected to cause legal problems for the Pentagon and Justice Department in their efforts to prosecute terrorists involved in the Pentagon and World Trade Center attacks.""

Leicester Busts  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/england/newsid_1767000/1767430.stm

Seventeen people are now in custody in a British antiterror crackdown in Leicester and London, the BBC reports. Nine of them are being held on suspicion of terror-related activity, the others on immigration charges. They include the first two men to be charged in Britian of being al Qaeda members.

The Bosnian Connection  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64603-2002Jan17.html

""In an operation coordinated with the Bosnian government, U.S. troops today seized and removed to an undisclosed location six Arab terror suspects who were released from a Bosnian prison,"" the Washington Post reports. ""The arrests are the first known case of U.S. soldiers in the war on terrorism apprehending suspects outside the Afghan war theater."" The men, five Algerians and a Yemeni, allegedly plotted to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo.

Al Qaeda Drag Queens  http://www.nandotimes.com/world/story/221341p-2138309c.html

Pakistani police have arrested five suspected al Qaeda members disguised in burkhas. Lucky for them they weren't in Malaysia.  Agence France-Presse  http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/printpage/0,5942,3607277,00.html  reports that ""a man who turned up in an Islamic court in a miniskirt and high heeled sandals"" was jailed for a week after pleading guilty to ""cross-dressing and behaving like a woman at a public place."" AFP adds: ""Mohamad Ade was told by the Shariah court that it was forbidden for a Muslim man to cross-dress and act immorally.""

Yuck!  http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,2002020010-2002029811,00.html

Here's one of the most revolting terror-related stories we've read: The Times of London reports Flight 63 may have been saved by alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid's ""sweaty feet."" He ""had trouble igniting his explosive-packed trainers because his feet were sweating and had dampened the non-metal fuse, said US officials.""

Statue of Limitations  http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/37859.htm

That politically correct fireman statue won't be built after all, the New York Post reports. ""After talks with Fire Commissioner Nicholas Scoppetta, developer Bruce Ratner abandoned efforts to erect the statue, which was to be based on a photo that made the front pages of newspapers nationwide."" We noted and criticized the plan  last week  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001707 , and our  Tunku Varadarajan  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001729  defended it earlier this week.

Dumb Criminal of the Week  http://www.salon.com/news/wire/2002/01/18/phony_pilot/index.html

""An Egyptian man who raised suspicion one week after the terrorist attacks when he was found carrying a fake pilot's uniform and license has been found guilty of lying about his plans to attend flight school,"" the Associated Press reports.

Wael Abdel Rahman Kishk arrived at John F. Kennedy International Airport Sept. 19, and immigration agents found the ""crude forgery"" of a Federal Aviation Administration license, which he had apparently made in order to impress his girlfriend. The FBI repeatedly asked him if he planned to attend flight school in America; ""over and over again, he denied it."" In fact, he planned to attend aviation classes at Big Bend Community College in Moses Lake, Wash.

Kishk faces six months to five years in prison, plus deportation. He was acquitted of impersonating a pilot.

Stupidity Watch
Have you ever made an illegal copy of a movie video? If so,  Jack Valenti  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/17/technology/circuits/17VIDE.html?pagewanted=all , head of the Motion Picture Association of America thinks you're scarcely different from Osama bin Laden. ""We're fighting our own terrorist war,"" he tells the New York Times (link requires registration) of the MPAA's antipiracy efforts.

Columnist  Paul Campos  http://newsandopinion.com/0102/campos.html  refers to ""the Tofu Taliban, many of whose members feel no compunction about offering strangers unsolicited advice ('You know, that's really not good for you') regarding the moral character of their dietary habits."" We find health nuts obnoxious and tedious too, but until they start stoning people to death, the Taliban analogy is preposterously overwrought.

The Nation Strikes Out  http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=special&s=bivens20020117

What can you say about a magazine that publishes a major factual error in the very first sentence of an article? Here's how Matt Bivens's piece in The Nation begins: ""When George W. Bush co-owned the Houston Astros and construction began on a new stadium, Kenneth Lay agreed to spend $100 million over thirty years for rights to name the park after Enron."" Of course, it was the Texas Rangers, not the Astros, that Bush co-owned. The Rangers' stadium, the  Ballpark at Arlington  http://www.ballparks.com/baseball/american/bpkarl.htm , is one of the few holdouts from the trend toward corporate sponsorship.

Zero-Tolerance Watch  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/metro/legislature/0118zero.html

The Georgia Legislature is considering a bill that would restore sanity to school-discipline policies in the Peach State. ""Partly in response to Cobb County's 'zero tolerance' nightmare of a year ago--the Tweety Bird key-chain case--a group of lawmakers has filed a bill reminding local boards they can take into account whether students intended to harm someone when deciding how to discipline them for bringing ""weapons"" to school,"" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.

Stop Suing Us!  http://www.accessatlanta.com/ajc/metro/0102/0117library.html

A federal jury has ordered Fulton County, Ga., to pay nearly $25 million for discriminating against five white librarians. ""I am greatly disturbed and concerned at the outcome of this case, not only because of the enormity of the judgment, but because this is at least the fourth reverse discrimination case in recent memory that Fulton County has lost, costing the taxpayers literally tens of millions of dollars,"" Fulton County Commission chairman Mike Kenn tells the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Hey Mike, there's a simple solution to this problem: Stop discriminating!

Well, It's Easier Than Making the Teachers Smarter  http://www.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20020117teachersreg4p4.asp

Pennsylvania has a shortage of math teachers, partly because so many applicants for teaching jobs are failing the ""pre-professional skills test."" The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reports that Frank Meehan, director of the state's Bureau of Teacher Certification and Preparation, ""said that because the state has a shortage of math teachers, it may make the test easier to get a higher passing rate.""

Correction
Because of our own arithmetic error, an  item yesterday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001739#kira  misstated the amount of time we estimate three-year-old Kira Kerkorian spends on the phone. We should have said five hours a day, not 12 1/2. The good news is that we're still qualified to teach math in Pennsylvania.

""If George W. Bush becomes president, the armies of the homeless, hundreds of thousands strong, will once again be used to illustrate the opposition's arguments about welfare, the economy, and taxation.""-- Mark Helprin  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/mhelprin/?id=65000507 , Oct. 31, 2000

Win a Free Trip to Communist Hell!  http://www.korea-dpr.com/winprize.htm

North Korea is holding an essay contest in honor of ""Great Leader"" Kim Jong Il's 60th birthday, Feb. 16. (By coincidence, this is during President's Day weekend.) Or, as a Spanish-based North Korean Web site puts it:

*** QUOTE ***

We, reflecting the unanimous desire of the world progressive people organize the following prize contest on world-wide scale on the occasion of his 60th birthday.

*** END QUOTE ***

Among the "" themes of works  http://www.korea-dpr.com/winprize1.htm "" are ""work praising the great ideological, theoretical activities and art of leadership of the respect Comrade KIM JONG IL,"" ""work expressing the might of single-hearted unity and invincible vitality of the Korean Worker's Party,"" and ""work about the superiority of the Korean-style socialist system centered on popular masses and the Korean people's struggle for building a socialist powerful nation.""

The first prize is a trip to North Korea, but the site doesn't say what the second prize is. How about two trips to North Korea?

G. Bush and C. Powell are sitting in a bar. A guy walks in and asks the
barman, ""Isn't that Bush and Powell?"" The barman says, ""Yep, that's them.""
So the guy walks over and says, ""Hello, what are you guys doing?"" Bush says,
""We're planning world war 3"" The guy says, ""Really? What's going to happen?""
Bush says, ""Well, we're going to kill 10 million Afghans and one bicycle
repairman.""  The guy exclaimed, ""Why are you gonna kill a bicycle
repairman?!!!"" So Bush turns to Powell and says, ""See, I told you no one
would worry about the 10 million Afghans""""

"Don't be FOOLED by the market rally...","Dear Investor,

Remember the smiley-faced mayor in the movie Jaws...

...telling all the tourists that it was ""safe"" to go
back into the water?  He had dollar-signs where his
heart should have been.  Lying for the sake of money.
Pushing more people right into the jaws of the Great
White Shark!

Today, a very similar thing is happening now on Wall
Street.  And if you listen to the ""all-is-well""
analysts, brokers and investment advisors, you're
going to end up SHARK-BAIT, too,

YOU SEE, everything ISN'T all right.  Not by a long
shot.  The economy stinks -- unemployment is at a
decade's high; consumer confidence is shot; and we're
in a nasty recession.  Does that sound like the right
prescription for a broad-based, sustainable market
rally?

Of course not.  I'd bet on Osama Bin Laden turning
himself in, before I'd bet even one dollar on ""the
market,""

BUT -- and this is a very critical point -- just
because the market is a mess...doesn't mean you can't
make a lot of money.  YOU CAN -- if you understand the
only smart way to invest now.

Why are so many stocks down 30%, 50%, 70% or more from
their highs?  SIMPLE -- their earnings have sunk like
rocks in the middle of the ocean.  And there's no sign
these companies' profits are coming back anytime soon.
The biggest PROBLEM CHILD?  Technology.  Tech
companies -- with very few exceptions -- are drowning
in red ink.  And while their stocks occasionally give
you short-term bounces...they offer little in the way of
lasting gains.

IF YOU WANT to stay safe now -- but still earn
handsome profits you can take to the bank -- you must
invest in those companies I call ""EARNINGS MONSTERS.""

That's the term I use for companies bucking the
current trend...and GROWING their earnings anywhere from
30%-to-50%--while most companies are lucky to earn
anything at all.  These ""EARNINGS MONSTERS"" are the
only sort of stocks we own at my Blue Chip Growth
Advisory.  And they're the only stocks that YOU should
even think of owning now.

I've written to you several times about out ""Earnings
Monsters"" over the last few months.  And I'm sorry you
haven't yet joined my roster of Blue Chip Growth
clients because you're MISSING OUT:

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  It's already UP 92% for the
year!

*PeopleSoft is one of the few tech stocks I own today.
Why?  Solid 30%+ earnings growth so far in 2001.  In
fact, 3rd quarter profits ""beat the street"" by 25%.
The result?  The stock is UP 105% since October 1st.

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  It's up a nice, stomach-
calming 34% YTD.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and its
stock is UP 21% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
193% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth  And those are the sort of
profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in the
EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started 16 years ago, MPT Review,
has GAINED 3,850% in that time, according to The
Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC last year and pocketed 466% gains.  We
SOLD Lucent after it gained 158%.  We banked 209%
gains overall from Cisco; 189% in Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart.  All
stocks we SOLD last year.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

Today, consensus opinion states that 10 rate cuts...tax
rebates...one round of tax cuts with more to follow...and
a stimulus package that could reach $100 billion, will
combine to KICK-START the economy again.  Problem is,
with everything that has happened, no one knows
exactly when.

But if you own today's EARNINGS MONSTERS, you don't
have to worry.  You can make money now -- and bank
even BIGGER GAINS once a shred of optimism returns to
the overall market.  Quick 30%, 40%, 50% pops that
lead to profits like we banked previously from Dell
Computer (+320.%), Vodafone AirTouch (+196.0%) and
Nokia (+316.%)...back when these companies were EARNING
MONSTERS, too.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. Profits at most companies have fallen off a
cliff.  But not at the companies we own at BLUE CHIP
GROWTH.  Over the past three quarters our EARNINGS
MONSTERS met or BEAT expectations about 95% of the
time -- and we're seeing nice gains, even in this
difficult time.  Please join us and get your full
share of the BIG PROFITS yet to come.  Click here now:

lesser of two weevils.
3. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were  chilly, but when they lit a fire in
the craft, it sank, proving once again  that you can't have your kayak and
heat it, too.
4. A three-legged dog  walks into a saloon in the Old West. He slides up to
the bar and announces:  ""I'm looking for the man who shot my paw.""
5. Did you hear about the  Buddhist who refused Novocain during a root
canal?
He wanted to transcend  dental medication.
6. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel  and were standing in
the lobby discussing their recent tournament  victories.  After about an
hour, the manager came out of the office and  asked them to disperse. ""But
why?"", one asked, as they moved off. ""Because,""  he said, ""I can't stand
chess nuts boasting in an open foyer.""
7. A  woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a
family  in Egypt and is named ""Ahmal."" The other goes to a family in Spain;
they name  him ""Juan."" Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his
birth mother.  Upon receiving the picture,  She tells her husband that she
wishes she  also had a picture of Ahmal.  Her husband responds,  ""They're
twins!  If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal.""
8.  These friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened up a
small  florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from
the men  of God, a rival florist across town thought the competition was
unfair. He  asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He
went
back and  begged the friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival
florist
hired  Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to
""persuade""  them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store,
saying he'd  be back if they didn't close up shop. Terrified, they did so,
thereby proving  that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.
9. Mahatma Gandhi,  as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which
produced an   impressive set of calluses on his feet.  He also ate very
little, which  made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from
bad breath.  This made him ....what? (Oh, man, this is so bad, it's good) ..
A super  callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.
10. And finally, there was a  man who sent ten different puns to friends,
with the hope that at least one  of the puns would make them laugh.
Unfortunately, no pun in ten  did.

Best of the Web Today - January 15, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Walker to Be Charged  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/15/ret.walker.charges/index.html

Marin mujahid John Walker will be charged with aiding and abetting terrorism. The Justice Department plans a press conference to discuss the matter around 3:30 p.m. EST. ""It was not clear whether he would face other federal charges,"" CNN reports.

Pretzel Logic  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020114/bs/enron_hands_off_2.html

As we  noted yesterday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001725 , Democrats who are desperately seeking to spin the Enron fiasco into a political scandal have been having trouble agreeing on just what would constitute a scandal. Some think it would be a scandal if Enron's political contributions to President Bush influenced his administration's decisions; others think it would be a scandal if the administration refused to help the company in its hour of need. Now, the Associated Press reports, a self-proclaimed ethics watchdog has managed to twist the two contradictory scenarios into one:

*** QUOTE ***

Because of Enron's heavy donations to President Bush's campaigns, administration officials ""were tied at the hip to Enron,"" said Bill Allison, an official of the private Center for Public Integrity. That made it hard to help.

""The appearance would have looked terrible,"" Allison said. ""They felt that they couldn't act on behalf of Enron because of the political fallout.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Allison seems to be complaining that Enron's campaign contributions did influence the administration--by making it impossible for it to help without creating the appearance of a conflict of interest. But wait. Haven't self-proclaimed ethics watchdogs been telling us for decades that it's a public official's duty to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest? Besides, there's no actual evidence that the administration ignored Enron's entreaties for any reason other than the merits. All we have is the appearance of an attempt to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. We doubt this pretzel is going to choke President Bush.

The Nativists Are Restless  http://www.vdare.com/fulford/bush_arab.htm

One heartening feature of the post-Sept. 11 political landscape has been the absence of a generalized backlash against immigrants. You'd think a horrific sneak attack by 19 foreigners on American soil would be a perfect opportunity for the close-the-borders crowd, but they've scarcely been heard from. Of course, their argument wouldn't really stand up; it's preposterous on its face to suggest that Mexican gardeners are a national-security threat, even if Arab flight students are.

It also may be that the anti-immigrant folks are getting ignored because they have a tendency to be cranks. Evidence of the latter hypothesis can be found on Peter Brimelow's Web site, VDare.com, which features an article by James Fulford on Walied Shater, the Arab-American Secret Service man who is threatening to make a federal case out of his run-in with an American Airlines pilot. We have criticized Shater's behavior, but Fulford objects to his ethnicity:

*** QUOTE ***

My question is one that no one seems to have asked: Why does W. have an Arab bodyguard anyway? . . .

Anwar Sadat was assassinated by his own troops (Bin Laden and friends have been linked to that incident). But Sadat didn't have any choice about being guarded by Arabs. Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguard. She did have a choice about being guarded by Sikhs, rather than Hindus, at a time when her troops were engaged in clearing Sikh terrorists out of the Sikh temple. In bullet-riddled retrospect, her choice was wrong. . . .

President Bush seems to be irate that his bodyguard couldn't get on the plane. . . . What makes me [upset]--even madder than heck--is that Bush, who is involved in a War on Arab Terrorism, is so politically correct that he apparently sees nothing wrong with being guarded by a man who may decide, on principle, to kill him.

*** END QUOTE ***

This is utterly cracked. Shater is no traitor; no one has accused him of being anything worse than a jackass. Unless all the news accounts are wrong, he is not an Arab national but an American of Arab descent. If Fulford had been around in 1944, would he have complained that the supreme allied commander in Europe was a ""German""?

Intelligence at Sea  http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20020115-76931312.htm

""U.S. intelligence agencies helped Israel track down a Palestinian ship that tried to smuggle a large supply of weapons obtained from Iran,"" The Washignton Times' Bill Gertz reports. ""U.S. intelligence agencies, using various high-tech intelligence-gathering means, were able to identify the Karine A after it loaded the weapons near Iran's Kish Island, some 300 miles north of the major Iranian naval port of Bandar Abbas.""

Hmm, maybe they could  brief Colin Powell  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#explain  and explain just what the ship was up to.

Osama at Sea  http://abcnews.go.com/sections/world/DailyNews/escape020114.html

There's another ship they may want to keep an eye out for. ABC News reports that ""an intelligence analysis sent to the CIA director last week concluded Osama bin Laden has escaped American efforts to find him in Afghanistan and that he most likely has fled the entire region by sea.""

Roundup in Pakistan  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/15/international/asia/15STAN.html

Pakistan ""has rounded up 1,430 people across the country in recent days and sealed 390 offices of militant groups as part of a widening crackdown on extremists ordered by Gen. Pervez Musharraf."" For the first time, Kashmir-based militants are among those arrested. Indian officials remain skeptical; Defense Minister George Fernandes say, in the Times' words, that his country ""remained poised for war if Pakistan did not act quickly enough.""

Hide Your Women   http://www.nationalreview.com/28jan02/kurtz012802.shtml

In National Review, Stanley Kurtz defends the traditional Muslim practice of covering women:

*** QUOTE ***

The ""veil as body bag"" notion is both mistaken and dangerous. There is no surer way to drive the Islamic world into the arms of the fundamentalists than to force Western feminism on a newly conquered Muslim country. It is no coincidence that the two Muslim fundamentalist regimes of our day--Iran and Afghanistan--arose in nations that had systematically attempted to root out traditional Islamic practices regarding women. (Those efforts were sponsored by the shah in Iran and the Soviets in Afghanistan.) Instead of being damned as a senseless outrage, veiling deserves a qualified defense. The practice has undoubtedly slowed the Muslim world's path to modernity, and that is a serious problem. But that difficulty would never have arisen in the first place if veiling hadn't accomplished something important. Veiling is embraced by millions of Muslim men and women as one of the keys to their way of life. They are not mistaken.

*** END QUOTE ***

Well, maybe. On the other hand, the Turkish government is so opposed to traditional Muslim practices that women aren't even allowed to wear headscarves in many public facilities, yet there's no danger of a fundamentalist regime arising in Ankara. Besides, surely there's a happy medium between the Taliban and ""The Vagina Monologues."" Why not just let women themselves decide whether and how much to cover up?

Shaved Heads and Cheeseheads  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/01/14/cuba.detainees/index.html

Apparently there are no real human-rights problems left in the world. CNN reports Human Rights Watch is busy trying to protect a terrorist's unalienable right to facial hair. The U.S. military plans to shave Taliban and al Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, so as to prevent head lice. But HRW's James Ross complains: ""Shaving prisoners, whose beards may be for important religious purposes, raises a concern because that would be an affront to their dignity."" Wouldn't want to affront their dignity over a little thing like 3,000 people murdered on American soil.

Actually, the prisoners are being treated quite well. Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke notes that they're being fed ""three culturally appropriate meals"" a day. Breakfast, according to  USA Today  http://www.usatoday.com/news/attack/2002/01/15/usat-detainees.htm , is bagels and cream cheese.

Hey, at least they're getting cheese. Green Bay Packers fans, by contrast, may be forced to doff theirs, should their team make it to the Super Bowl. Reports the  New Orleans Times-Picayune  http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/frontpage/index.ssf?/newsstory/cheese12.html : ""In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, federal law enforcement officials are leaving nothing to chance for the country's annual showcase of football hype and hysteria. That hand-wringing may leave Packer backers without the oversized wedges of yellow foam rubber that, when worn as a hat, transform their owners into cheeseheads."" Maybe Human Rights Watch should take up the cause of cheesehead dignity.

Stupidity Watch
Stanford  http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2002/janfeb/features/rotc.html 's alumni magazine carries an article about ROTC, banned from campus since 1969:

*** QUOTE ***

""Basically the curriculum was awful,"" says Barton Bernstein, a Stanford history professor who helped lead the 1969 movement against ROTC. ""It was on the level of mediocre coursework in high school. The readings were sophomoric. The ROTC faculty were not PhDs. I think it was the case that some [opponents to ROTC] had deeper political purposes, but everybody could agree that it was an intellectual embarrassment."" . . .

""ROTC represents a group of pseudo-faculty preparing students for war and training them to kill, and that is fundamentally unacceptable at a university,"" says Bernstein.

""I understand that there are times when society wants militaristic approaches to problems, but I don't think it's the place of first-rate universities to feed those desires,"" says Cecilia Ridgeway, a professor of sociology and a Faculty Senate member. ""Universities are about solving problems through discussion, not military approaches.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Gary Hernandez, a Stanford senior who takes Army ROTC courses at another university, has a withering rejoinder to Bernstein's put-down of ROTC's intellectual content: ""I don't see why I can get credit for posture and hip-hop but not military navigation.""

The Boston Globe's  James Carroll  http://commondreams.org/views02/0115-01.htm  opines that ""because a unilateral war formed the core of America's response to Sept. 11, the single greatest moral shift to have occurred among nations in the 20th century has been undercut--the fragile, but precious idea of institutionalized international mutuality.""

Hear that sound? It's the world's smallest violin, playing a dirge for that precious, fragile, wilted flower, institutionalized international mutuality.

Tasteless Pun of the Day  http://www.auburnpub.com/edit.html

Under the headline ""Hits and Misses,"" the Citizen of Auburn, N.Y., offers the following:

*** QUOTE ***

HIT: To Sgt. 1st Class Nathan Chapman of San Antonio. He was the first U.S. soldier killed by enemy fire in Afghanistan. And HITS go to the seven crew members of a downed KC-130 tanker that crashed into a mountainside in Afghanistan as it prepared to land. Chapman and those Marines died for their country.

*** END QUOTE ***

Homelessness Rediscovery Watch  http://www.washtimes.com/national/20020114-89210984.htm

Several readers have written to ask if there really is more coverage of ""homelessness"" now than there was during the Clinton years. It certainly seems that way to us, and the Media Research Center has actually come up with some numbers. In an e-mail alert picked up in the Washington Times (fourth item), MRC's Liz Swazey writes:

*** QUOTE ***

Homelessness--one of the media's favorite tool to portray the alleged downside of Ronald Reagan's '80s prosperity--was a more serious national problem during Bill Clinton's 1990s. Patrick Markee of the Coalition for the Homeless admitted as much on [Wednesday] night's Hannity and Colmes on the Fox News Channel: ""Definitely, we saw more homelessness in the 1990s than we did in the 1980s.""

But we saw far less homelessness on TV sets during the Clinton years. The MRC did the math: During the first Bush administration, morning and evening newscasts on ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN ran an average of 53 stories on homelessness annually, compared to less than 17 per year during the Clinton administration.

The soon-to-be #1 New York Times bestseller, Bernard Goldberg's Bias, devotes an entire chapter to the media's indulgence in advocacy journalism on this topic. In it, Goldberg cited a 1999 column by the Providence Journal's Philip Terzian, formerly of the Carter administration, that showed the New York Times ran 50 stories on homelessness in 1988, including five on page one, but in 1998 ran only ten--not one on page one.

The expanding homeless population was out of sight during the Clinton years but just three short weeks after George W. Bush assumed office, ABC won the race to be the first network to rediscover the homeless: On Sunday, February 11, 2001, World News Tonight Sunday anchor Carole Simpson intoned: ""Homelessness, which is estimated to effect from two and a half to three and a half million people, is again on the rise.""

How convenient.

*** END QUOTE ***

Splitsville Chamber of Commerce  http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002/01/14/usatcov-divorce.htm

Most social-science findings fall into one of two categories: the obvious, and the obviously false. A new study of divorce by E. Mavis Hetherington of the University of Virginia is an example of the former category. It finds--surprise, surprise--that divorce is bad for kids. USA Today reports that among children of divorce, according to Hetherington's study, either 20% or 25% (depending on whether you believe the article text or the sidebar) ""have serious social, emotional or psychological problems,"" whereas only 10% of children in intact families do. That is to say, if you're divorced, your kids are at least twice as likely to be seriously screwed-up as if you're still married to their other parent.

Incredibly, though, Hetherington tries to pass this finding off as if it led to the exact opposite conclusion. As USA Today reporter Karen S. Peterson unskeptically describes it: ""The negative impact of divorce on both children and parents has been exaggerated and . . . only about one-fifth of youngsters experience any long-term damage after their parents break up."" Hetherington protests that she's ""not pro-divorce,"" but it's hard to see what purpose her pollyannish interpretation of her data can serve other than to ease whatever guilt and stigma are still associated with divorce.
 
To be sure, divorce is sometimes a necessary evil. It would be cruel and unreasonable to demand that anyone stay with an abusive or unfaithful spouse. But consider a case in which one spouse wants a divorce out of mere boredom or frustration. The spouse who doesn't want a divorce has a powerful rejoinder: ""We should stay together for the sake of the children."" It's all the more persuasive in light of Hetherington's finding that divorce more than doubles the likelihood that children will end up with ""serious social, emotional or psychological problems."" Unfortunately, readers or USA Today without a keen eye for statistical games will never know it.

Delawhere?  http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/education/edmap.html

http://opinionjournal.com/best/edmap.gif The White House Web site features a page touting the education bill President Bush recently signed. The page comes complete with a map of America; you can click on the state of your choice to get information about how the new law affects it. Just one problem: As the inset shows (click on it to see the whole thing), the map depicts Delaware as part of Maryland, and New Jersey is split in two, with the southern part of the state labeled as Delaware.

Out of curiosity, we clicked on the  District of Columbia  http://www.whitehouse.gov/infocus/education/states/dc.html . Alas, there's nothing there about remedial geography courses.

"Will you miss out again?","Dear Investor,

I guess you've been too busy to respond to my
invitation so far.  And that's a shame.

I've written several times, demonstrating the safest
way to make BIG PROFITS in this market.  I've offered
to let you try my investment advisory RISK-FREE.  And
most importantly, I've shown you exactly how my
clients and I are making a ton of money right now.

Sadly, you've missed out on some really nice gains --
but I'm hoping you'll join us before you miss any
more:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.  And
today -- after a slight pullback -- this generic drug-
maker has RISEN 62% since late March.  That's just
what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 103% since mid-
September!  That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits
I love best.

*You want to see strong growth in retail?  Check out
Best Buy.  The company is grabbing market share and
pumping up the profits -- in fact, it ""beat the
street"" again this quarter.  Wall Street LOVES a
winner.  The stock SOARED 151% in 2001!

*Conservative General Mills smashed through its all-
time high.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th --
the day after reporting earnings -- this stock closed
UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  That's why it rose a nice,
stomach-calming 32% for the year.

*What recession?  Chopper king Harley Davidson is
hogging all the profits.  The company announced chart-
topping earnings after-the-bell on October 9th, and
its stock is UP 27% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
362% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1, thanks to our commitment to earnings quality.
And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s, MPT
Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen years,
according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

HERE'S THE KEY: I'm a very fickle guy.  As long as a
company keeps performing, I love it...things start
looking iffy, I take the profits and run.

We DUMPED EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed 466%
gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot; 121% in
Microsoft; 179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in
Vodafone Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent;
201% in Cisco.  All stocks we SOLD before they soured.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they fell.  That's
why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue Chip
Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

Find out by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,

Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet! Now business is
booming again for this tech juggernaut, and it's time
to pile back in for our next round of  BIG fortune-
building gains.  Don't miss out this time.  Click here

[IMAGE]  Sector Timing  How to Invest, Where to Invest and When to Invest By Louis Navellier Editor, MPT Review According to the latest issue of The Hulbert Financial Digest, my MPT Review still holds the #1 ranking for total return over the last 15 years. I'm very grateful that I've been able to amass such a strong long-term record. I'm often asked about my ""secrets."" To tell you the truth, there aren't any. But one of the keys to success is knowing when to invest in certain sectors of the economy. For example, lately I've been telling my subscribers to invest in industries that do well right now, at this crucial point in the economic cycle.   Continue .

So far, the stock-market rally in the latter half of 2001 has been very good to investors following my portfolios, with some stocks and funds up 30% to 50%. Right now, I've pegged one stock to continue the positive trend for investors who climb aboard today.   Continue .

"For Subscribers Only","Dear InvestorPlace.com Member,

I'm about to reveal a BRAND-NEW wireless
recommendation to my subscribers, and I'm SO excited
about this opportunity that I want to share the
details with you, too.

You see, wireless growth is simply exploding around
the world -- especially after the September 11
terrorist attacks.  Cell phone giant Nokia, for
example, has skyrocketed 41% just since October
1st...worldwide wireless traffic is projected to grow a
whopping 30% in 2001 alone...China plans to spend $151
BILLION on its telecom infrastructure by 2005...and
that's just the very BEGINNING of what lies ahead for
this monstrous market!

Quite simply, the profit potential is huge, and I want
to make sure that my subscribers -- and now you -- get
a piece of the phenomenal gains ahead.  That's why I'm
so excited about my newest recommendation.  I expect
it to leap 50% in the next 12 months ALONE, and I'm
looking for more incredible gains after that.  Let me
show you why.

First, you might not even know about this, but there
has been an INTENSE tech competition over the last
couple of years for the new digital wireless standard.
That battle is now over -- and this company has WON!
That means their proprietary technology will be used
in most 2.5G cell phones (set to be deployed early in
2002), and in practically ALL of the next generation
3G phones.  That alone is a terrific boon for this
stock...but keep reading, because this opportunity gets
EVEN BETTER.

Not only does this company get paid for every one of
its chips used in 2.5G or 3G cell phones...but it also
gets paid a license fee from every single company that
wants to sell or market a cell phone based on its
winning technology.  And I'm not talking about a
simple one-time fee either -- these royalties get paid
on a QUARTERLY BASIS, for as long as the technology is
used.  One day, thanks to the strength of their
technology, I fully expect this company to get paid
for EVERY single cell phone in use!

And with projections for 1.3 billion cell phone
subscribers by 2003 and continued steady growth in
the following years, this is an absolutely EXPLOSIVE
opportunity for my stock.  This is a $42 billion
company growing an incredible 27% per year and
spending an impressive 17% of revenues on research
and development -- EXACTLY the type of commitment to
future growth that makes me so confident they will
maintain their competitive edge and DOMINATE their
market space for years to come.

I can almost guarantee that you'll be kicking yourself
for years to come if you don't buy this stock now.
DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN TO YOU!  I reveal the name of
this company -- including my buy price, target price
and full profit details -- in the December issue of
Technology Investing, which gets released TOMORROW.

To make sure that you're on board for ALL the profits
we expect to make with this wireless dominator, all
you have to do is accept a RISK-FREE trial to
Technology Investing today.  (Just visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0VN135

tomorrow, and I'll send you up to 5 FREE bonus reports
with all of the details on my other tech and biotech
recommendations.  Plus, your subscription will be
fully covered by my 100% MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.  That
means if you're not completely satisfied within the
first 6 months, I'll refund every single penny you've
paid.  No questions asked.

stock tomorrow for 50% gains in the next 12 months.

How Old Are You, Grandpa?


One evening a grandson was talking to his grandfather about current

events.


He asked what he thought about the shootings at schools, the computer

age, and just things in general.


The granddad replied, ""Well, let me think a minute ... I was born

before television, penicillin, polio shots, frozen foods, Xerox,

contact lenses, Frisbees and the pill.


There was no radar, credit cards, laser beams or ball-point pens. Man

had not invented pantyhose, air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes dryers,

well the clothes were hung out to dry in

the fresh air and man hadn't yet walked on the moon.


Your grandmother and I got married first, and then lived together.

Every family had a father and a mother, and every boy over

14 had a rifle that his dad taught him how to use and respect. And

they went hunting and fishing together. Until I was 25, I

called every man older than I, 'Sir'-and after I turned 25, I still

called policemen and every man with a title, 'Sir.' Sundays were

set aside for going to church as a family, helping those in need, and

visiting with family or neighbors.


We were before gay-rights, computer-dating, dual careers, daycare

centers, and group therapy.


Our lives were governed by the Ten Commandments, good judgment, and

common sense. We were taught to know the

difference between right and wrong and to stand up and take

responsibility for our actions.


Serving your country was a privilege; living here was a bigger

privilege.


We thought fast food was what people ate during Lent. Having a

meaningful relationship meant getting along with your

cousins.


Draft dodgers were people who closed their front doors when the

evening breeze started.


Time-sharing meant time the family spent together in the evenings and

weekends-not purchasing condominiums.


We never heard of FM radios, tape decks, CDs, electric typewriters,

yogurt, or guys wearing earrings. We listened to the Big

Bands, Jack Benny, and the President's speeches on our radios. And I

don't ever remember any kid blowing his brains out

listening to Tommy Dorsey.


If you saw anything with 'Made in Japan' on it, it was junk.


The term 'making out' referred to how you did on your school exam.


Pizza Hut, McDonald's, and instant coffee were unheard of. We had 5 &


10-cent stores where you could actually buy things for 5 and 10 cents.


Ice cream cones, phone calls, rides on a streetcar, and a Pepsi were

all a nickel. And if you didn't want to splurge, you could spend your nickel

on enough stamps to mail 1 letter and 2 postcards.


You could buy a new Chevy Coupe for $600, but who could afford one?

Too bad, because gas was 11 cents a gallon.


In my day, 'grass' was mowed, 'coke' was a cold drink, 'pot' was

something your mother cooked in, and 'rock music' was your

grandmother's lullaby.


'Aids' were helpers in the Principal's office, 'chip' meant a piece

of wood, 'hardware' was found in a hardware store, and

'software' wasn't even a word.


And we were the last generation to actually believe that a lady

needed a husband to have a baby.


No wonder people call us ""old and confused"" and say there is a

generation gap and how old do you think I am - ????


...... This man would be only 59 years old.

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Is Cisco the Next Enron???","Dear Investor,

Did you check out the January 21st cover story of
BusinessWeek?

If not, it's a MUST-READ for any investor in this age
of misinformation.  You see, the Enron debacle is just
the tip of the iceberg waiting to tear a huge hole in
your retirement dreams.  That's because super-
aggressive accounting techniques -- even when,
strictly speaking, not illegal -- have in many cases
drastically overstated how well certain companies have
really done.

And particularly now -- in a tough economic test that
most businesses are failing -- the temptation to use
SMOKE-AND-MIRROR accounting is stronger than ever
before.

THAT'S WHY YOU must be very, very fussy about the
stocks you own today.  And in just a moment, I'll
introduce you to my time-tested strategy that
identifies the true EARNINGS MONSTERS with laser-like
focus...and helps you avoid all the earnings dogs.

Enron, after all, was a huge disaster -- one with many
legal issues still to be decided.  But there are many
more ""earnings traps"" set to snare unwary investors.

TAKE CISCO, for example.  The BusinessWeek article
quotes Michael Porter of Harvard Business School as
saying, ""We will likely find that even during its so-
called heyday, Cisco wasn't nearly as profitable...as
many believed.""

Today, Cisco CEO John Chambers is still saying, ""I
believe the best years are in front of us.""  But
that's a bet I wouldn't make.  Cisco isn't going to
disappear like Enron.  But with analysts beginning to
take a harder look at REAL EARNINGS, it's very
doubtful that Cisco can grow fast enough to justify
its huge market cap.

And once traders take an ax to the stock, you could
lose 30%, 40%, 50% virtually overnight.

FRANKLY, I had concerns about Cisco's future two years
ago.  That's why I told clients of my Blue Chip Growth
advisory to sell and lock in our 201% gains.  And
since we sold, the stock has already dropped 59%

Of course, Cisco isn't the only high-flyer we dumped
before Wall Street caught on to the growing earnings
problem.  We dumped EMC in the year 2000 and pocketed
466% gains.  We BANKED 189% GAINS from Home Depot;
179% in Amgen; 113% in Wal-Mart; 196% in Vodafone
Airtouch; and 316% in Nokia.  156% in Lucent.

We owned them all while they were STILL EARNINGS
MONSTERS -- and sold them before they collapsed.
That's why I urge you to invest the way we do at Blue
Chip Growth.  It's simply the SAFEST WAY to HUNT FOR
PROFITS -- in any kind of market.

AS YOU'LL SEE, we don't own companies that might do
okay when the economy recovers.  We only own companies
that are EARNINGS MONSTERS right now:

*Our Forest Labs recently hit its all-time high.
Since then, it has pulled back slightly, but this
generic drug-maker has RISEN 64% since late March.
That's just what the doctor ordered!

*I've been pounding the table about Peoplesoft  for
months now.  It's up a STUNNING 96% since October!
That's the kind of big SHORT-TERM profits I love best.

*Conservative General Mills is a fantastic cornerstone
stock today.  Why?  GREAT EARNINGS.  On December 20th
-- the day after reporting earnings -- this stock
closed UP 19% in 2-months' time.

*Retailer Lowe's is one great example of the stocks we
own at Blue Chip Growth.  No razzle-dazzle.  Just
strong earnings growth.  The stock POPPED 109% in
2001!

*Tenet Healthcare is a great little company to own in
times like these.  It's a top-player in a virtually
recession-proof business.  We're up more than 60% so
far!

*What manufacturing recession?  Chopper king Harley
Davidson is hogging all the profits.  The company --
named company of the year by Forbes magazine --
announced chart-topping earnings after-the-bell on
October 9th, and its stock is UP 26% since.

*If you like HOME RUNS, our stock in Emulex has SOARED
over 300% since the beginning of October.  Why?  Because
it's one of very few tech stocks that's still an
EARNINGS MONSTER!

We own all these stocks -- and some twenty more like
them -- at Blue Chip Growth.  And those are the sort
of profits YOU'RE MISSING OUT on by not investing in
the EARNINGS MONSTERS I write about in my advisory.

And this isn't some short-term success story.

Since I started my Blue Chip Growth advisory in late
1997, our portfolio has beaten the S&P better than 2-
to-1.  And the advisory I started in the mid-1980s,
MPT Review, has GAINED 3,850% in the last sixteen
years, according to The Hulbert Financial Digest.

WHY.  Because I'm a very demanding guy.  When a
company slips -- no matter how great it has been -- I
dump it.

So which companies qualify as EARNINGS MONSTERS now?

FIND OUT by trying my Blue Chip Growth advisory RISK-
FREE.  You'll make money -- or it won't cost you a
dime.  I'll give you six months to try the service
risk-free -- set the bar as high as you want.  Sign up
now.  I'll introduce you to the EARNINGS MONSTERS that
are your best bet for 50% gains -- or more -- over the
next 6 months.  Go here now:

Sincerely,
Louis Navellier
Blue Chip Growth

P.S. I just added a new stock to my MUST-BUY list of
earnings monsters.  Actually, it's not entirely new --
it's an old favorite that rewarded us with 320% GAINS
last time around.  That was sweet!  We dumped it
because earnings took a turn for the worse.  But now
business is booming again for this tech juggernaut,
and it's time to pile back in for our next round of
BIG fortune-building gains.  Don't miss out this time.

Don't take chances, and you won't get ""Enroned.""  Stick
with the true EARNINGS MONSTERS we own at Blue Chip Growth.

> > MEMO FROM SANTA

> > I regret to inform you that effective immediately, I
> >
> > will no longer be
> > able to serve the Southern United States on
> > Christmas
> > Eve.  Due to the
> > overwhelming population of the earth, my contract
> > was
> > renegotiated  by
> > North American Fairies and Elves Local #209. I now
> > serve only  certain
> > areas of New England, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,

> > longer
> > breaks  for milk and

> > so keep that in mind. However, I am certain that
> > your
> > children will be
> > in good hands with your local replacement who
> > happens
> > to be  my third
> > cousin, Bubba Claus. His side of the family is from
> > the South Pole.  He
> > shares my goal of delivering toys to all the good
> > boys
> > and  girls.
> > However, there are a few differences between us such
> > as:
> >
> > 1.  There is no danger of The Grinch stealing your
> > presents from Bubba
> > Claus. He  has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper
> > sticker that reads:
> > ""These toys  insured by Smith and Wesson.""
> >
> > 2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus  prefers
> > that children leave
> > an RC cola and pork rinds [or a moon pie] on the
> > fireplace and Bubba
> > doesn't smoke a pipe. He dips a little snuff though,
> > so  please have an
> > empty spit can handy.
> >
> > 3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled  by floppy-eared,
> > flyin' coon dogs
> > instead of reindeer. I made the mistake of  loaning
> > him a couple of my
> > reindeer, one time, and Blitzen's head now
> > overlooks
> > Bubba's fireplace.
> >
> > 4. You won't hear ""On Comet, on Cupid, on  Donner
> > and
> > Blitzen..."" when
> > Bubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, ""On
> > Earnhardt, on Wallace, on
> > Martin and Labonte. On Rudd, on Jarrett, on Elliott
> > and Petty.""
> >
> > 5. ""Ho, ho, ho!"" has been replaced by ""Yee Haw!"" And
> > you also  are likely
> > to hear Bubba's elves respond, ""I her'd dat!""
> >
> > 6. As  required by Southern highway laws, Bubba
> > Claus'
> > sleigh does have a
> > Yosemite  Sam safety triangle on the back with the
> > words ""Back off"". The
> > last I heard  it also had other decorations on the
> > sleigh as well. One is
> > a Ford logo with  lights that race through the
> > letters
> > and the other is a
> > caricature of me  (Santa Claus) peeing on the Tooth
> > Fairy.
> >
> > 7. The usual Christmas movie  classics such as
> > ""Miracle on 34th Street""
> > and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" will  not be shown in
> > your
> > negotiated viewing
> > area. Instead, you'll see ""Boss Hog  Saves
> > Christmas""
> > and ""Smokey and the
> > Bandit IV"" featuring Burt Reynolds as  Bubba Claus
> > and
> > dozens of state
> > police cars crashing into each  other.
> >
> > 8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. If I were you,
> > I'd
> > make sure  the
> > wife and the kids turn the other way when he bends
> > over to put  presents
> > under the tree.
> >
> > 9. And finally, lovely Christmas songs have  been

Subject:	Re: Open Containers

Dear Joe,

This will help you out:

""A person commits a Class C misdemenor if the person knowingly possesses an
open container in a passenger area of a motor vehicle that is on a public
highway, regardless of whether the vehicle is being operated, is stopped, or
is parked.
Possession of more than one open container in a single criminal episode is a
single offense.
'Open container' means any receptacle that contains any amounts of alcoholic
beverage that is open, has been opened, has a broken seal, or has any
contents partially removed.
'Passneger Area of the motor vehicle' means the area designed for seating of
the operator and passengers, and does not include:
a glove box or other similar storage container that is locked;
the trunk;
the area behind the last upright seat of the vehicle if the vehicle does
not have a trunk.
It is an exception to the application of this sectionthat the defendant was
a passenger in:
A motor vehicle designated, maintained or used primarily for the
transportation for compensation, including a bus, taxicab, or limousine; or
A motor home or recreational vehicle.
Upon making a written promise to appear, a peace officer must release the
suspect with a written citation.""
This is quoted from the Texas Penal Code, Subsection 49.031.  Now, I am not
a lawyer, and I am not giving legal advice, but here are my thoughts on this
law.
1.	You can not have an open beer, open liquor bottle, or any other open
alcoholic beverage any where in the passenger compartment.  This applies to
both the driver and all the passengers.  You don't have to be consuming the
alcoholic beverage, it just has to be ""open.""  And open is defined as open,
broekn seal, or contents partially removed.  So a screw top bottle that has
been opened once, is alsways considered ""open"".  So if you are taking a
bottle of Jack Daniels to a friends house and the bottle has the seal
broken, it must be in the locked glove box, locked center console or trunk.
2.	Penalties:  The crime is a Class C offense, just like most other traffic
tickets.  The fine will be any where from $1.00 to $500.00 as set by the
Judge.  Figure it is probably going to be about $250.
3.	Jail time:  Normally you can not be put in jail for this offense.  As
long as you agree to sign the ticket, the officer must write you a ticket
and release you.  However, you can be put in jail for other offenses in
combination with an Open Container offense.  Also, if you refuse to signt he
ticket, you can and probably will be put in jail.
4.	Pick up trucks:  the alcohol container needs to be behind the rear seats
or only row of seats or in the glove box or center console or in the bed.
5.	Citations are issued to the persons determined to be in possession of the
containers.  If the passengers are determind to be in possession of the
containters and not the driver, the passengers get the ticket(s).  If it
can't be determind who was in possession, every one could get a tickets, or
just the driver, or no one.

Hope this helps.

No, not an automatic trip.  Normally you must be issued a citation.

 	 	    Dear Don,  The White House continues to push for an economic stimulus package, with time running out for Democrats and Republicans trying to reach a deal.  Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Tuesday, we'll continue to watch for developments with the stimulus legislation. Some of the proposals contain significant tax relief potential for energy businesses.   The Senate Commerce Committee's Consumer Affairs Subcommittee will hold its first hearing Tuesday on the collapse of Enron. Peter says like the previous hearing on the House side, Enron management is not expected to take part.  At least one Enron shareholder will participate.   When Enron wraps up its bankruptcy case, many may walk away with little or no money.  However, some will benefit from Enron's demise - bankruptcy attorneys.  On Tuesday, University of Houston Law Center Director, Dean Nancy Rapaport talks about how corporate bankruptcies equal big business for lawyers.   Continuing Enron coverage, Raymond James & Associates Oil Field Service Analyst Jim Rollyson is stopping by the Houston bureau on Thursday.  He'll talk about the effects of the Enron collapse on the oil field services industry during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   UBS PaineWebber First Vice President of Investments Robert Young will also join us from the Houston bureau on Tuesday.  He'll bring us up to speed on how the investment community views companies cutting expenses.  Catch Young during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.

"Monday night's meeting","I apologize for the late email, but it was quite a week of meetings.  We had
71 people at the meeting the last time that I counted.  We had 13 speakers
and a mutlitude of homeowners.  The candidates were impressed that we had so
many people at a meeting - without food!  Clear Creek Village has the
wonderful reputation of being very active in the community and other
neighborhoods are beginning to look at us to see why we are so successful.  I
hate to list the speakers for fear of misspelling someone or having the
incorrect position for which they are running.  I am sure that someone will
let me know if I am wrong.  The speakers drew numbers and spoke for three
minutes in the following order:
  Leola Hancock, Galveston County Republican Chair
  Katheleen McCumber, JP Pct 8, Pos 1
  Mike Hembree, City Council, League City
  Ed Sebesta, County Comm, Pct 4
  Tommy Cones, City Council, League City
  Chris Mallios, County Comm, Pct 4
  Theresa Tungate, Speaking on behalf of the swim teams for the community
center
  Richard Tindall ,  JP, Pct 8, Pl 1
  Chris Stevens, Galv. Cty Clerk
  Larry Taylor, State Representive
  Tad Nelson, State Representative
  David Kilpatrick, City Council, League City
  Ken Clark, County Commm Pct 4
There was a question session after all of the speakers.  PLEASE VOTE.  Early
voting on a proposed community center, charter ammendments and City council
ends Tuesday. You can vote early at city hall, 300 W. Walker St. Hours are 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday and Tuesday.  Election Day is February 2, 2002.  Let's
put Clear Creek Village on the map again by ahving a record turn out!

To claim your FREE 35mm Panorama Camera, click the link below

http://www.play4keeps.com/rd.cgi?camera

Simply put, I can't. At least not to everyone, but you were smart enough to request free products from your-free-present, so you're entitled!

But here's the catch! There is very limited supply - we will not be getting this camera again and folks have been ordering this camera like crazy.

In fact, just before I sent this email my inventory quantities showed only 83 left. So, I need you to click the link below so I can ship yours before they're gone! Do it now, and I guarantee you'll be one of the very lucky folks to receive this terrific camera - FREE!

<>, I look forward to sending you more top quality products in the future. However, if you don't want to receive emails with free merchandise (although I can't imagine why!) simply click the link below and we'll pass your offer on to someone else.

"Why Larry Ellison is tearing his hair out...","Dear Investor,

Thanks to ""Siggy,"" this tech Blue Chip ROSE 29% in
2001. And it's taking new territory so aggressively
that Oracle's Larry Ellison is tearing his hair out.

29% GAINS! That's an amazing number when you consider
two points:

1. This isn't some small-fry bucking the trend because
of some lucky break.

2. It's one of the BIG BOYS of technology, having a
good year when virtually every other big boy from
Cisco to Oracle to Intel has suffered badly.

CAN YOU IMAGINE how well this stock will do when the
economy and sentiment turns!  Siggy is HOT.  And it's
going to make us a ton of money in the months and
years ahead--say, 50% in 6 months and a small fortune
after that.

But what is this ""Siggy thing,"" you might ask.  It's a
transistor, SiGe (nicknamed Siggy) more than 100-times
faster than Intel's screaming Pentium 4--made by the
same company that first discovered that silicon
germanium could soup up chip performance.  This
technology is new--introduced for the first time in
1999.  But it's taking the entire industry by storm.

Worldwide sales were a few million dollars in 1999,
but projections make this at least a $2 billion
product in less than 5 years!  Here's the short story.

First you plop a 200-atom thick layer of silicon
germanium on an old garden-variety silicon chip.  Then
you redesign the vertical bipolar transistor for
increased efficiency.  And bingo, you're the proud
parent of the world's fastest silicon transistor.

HOW FAST IS IT?  It turns on and off over 200 billion
times a second!  Running Siggy against a Pentium is
like running a Ducati 996R superbike against a Vespa
scooter!   What does this speed mean?  Here's one
example.  Souped-up silicon chips delivering mega
amounts of data to homes is a wireless dream about to
come true.  There's no need to run expensive cables.
The LAST-MILE barrier to broadband is hurdled without
wires!

But there's a LOT MORE to Siggy's story than just
that.  Nothing--and I mean nothing--up to now has come
close to Siggy's performance and versatility.  As I've
already said, it's blazing fast--a critical factor in
high-speed communications.  Yet it draws incredibly
little power at the same time--a boon that is finally
making the next generation of wireless technologies
possible.  What's more, this chip creates
exceptionally little background ""noise,"" making it
ideal for applications that depend on high
sensitivity.

So how is this technology being used--and who's using
it?

Siggy's MOST IMPORTANT application is in all facets of
high-speed communications.  If you knew what you were
looking for, you'd find this chip in Internet
appliances, cell phones, storage modules, base
stations, broadband networks, wireless on-site
networks and more.  Virtually everywhere that HIGH-
SPEED communications makes its mark.  Both analog and
digital, as well.  Time Domain Corp.--#1 globally in
Ultra Wideband wireless technology uses Siggy to power
its performance and profits.  Companies like Vitesse
and  Sierra Monolithics find Siggy a crucial component
in the high-end equipment that makes fiber optic
communications possible.  Alcatel is big on Siggy for
being key to affordable high-performance networks.

The list goes on and on.  It seems that barely a day
goes by that Siggy's corporate parent doesn't announce
new accolades--and big new contracts--for its
offspring.

THAT'S PRETTY NEAT when you consider this company's
background.  As I mentioned earlier, it's huge and
incredibly profitable.  In fact, right now this firm
has Larry Ellison tearing his hair out, as it
overtakes Oracle on its own database turf.

But up until a few years ago, this company didn't even
make chips for ""outside consumption.""  Of course, when
you've got hot technologies--and Siggy is just one of
many--why not take advantage.

Today, this firm does about $3 billion in annual chip
sales--and we're not talking those run-of-the-mill
chips that everyone from California to Taiwan knows
how to make.  This outfit specializes in custom-built,
high-end models like Siggy, where they have a
technological edge--and FAT profit margins.

WANT TO LEARN MORE?  Want the name of Siggy's parent?.
Want to own a tech stock that's actually making folks
richer this year--one that can make you richer NOW and
for years to come?

"","Don,

I have had a chance to look over the MDEA folder and saw that all the sheets I am responsible for are all there with the exception of the MDEA faxed sheets. Now I know these are my sheets because due to a glitch in the page setup the OATI checkouts print the last hour off the page and it is not seen on the sheet I fax across to Entergy Trans. Since my fax transmission pages are also present I fail to see how only the MDEA fax sheets can disappear since I hold them together by means of a u-clip which was in the folder too. I  was told today that such means of securing the papers might not be the best and that I should staple them instead.

As for the Load sheet matrix, I have been doing that consistently and never has a problem presented itself before this. I can only conclude that it was a software glitch. However I wanted to ensure that I wasnt doing anything wrong in terms of procedure. I am sorry this brought about so much inconvenience but I can assure you it is not due to a lack in my efforts. 

For the former printing problem I have spoken with the IT Resolution centre and hopefully they'll have an answer for me soon. As for the latter I shall simply take a printout of the same henceforth. Please feel free to let me know if I need to do something more.


Regards,


Punit.

Best of the Web Today - January 9, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Plane Down  http://www.cnn.com/2002/US/01/09/gen.war.against.terror/index.html

""A U.S. Marine Corps KC-130 refueling jet crashed Wednesday near the western Pakistan city of Quetta,"" CNN reports. There was no sign of enemy fire, and there's no word on casualties. Reportedly, seven Marines were aboard and the plane was en route from Islamabad, the Pakistani capital.

Springtime for Osama  http://www.nationalpost.com/commentary/columnists/story.html?f=/stories/20020107/1053525.html

When the Afghan campaign started back in October, naysayers argued that victory would come slowly if ever. America couldn't defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda without sending in a massive contingent of ground troops; we would have to stop fighting for Ramadan, lest we inflame the Muslim ""street""; and once Ramadan was over, the brutal Afghan winter wouldn't be far behind, rendering further operations impossible until things thawed out in, oh, around April or May.

Every aspect of this scenario turned out to be wrong--including the weather forecast.  The Weather Channel  http://www.weather.com/maps/geography/africaandmiddleeast/afghanistanforecast_large.html  has a map to prove it. As Mark Steyn observes in Monday's National Post:

*** QUOTE ***

Yesterday, it was 55 and clear in Kandahar and Herat. Ghurian checked in at 55, with 62 predicted for tomorrow. Fifty-seven and sunny in Bost and Laskar, with 64 expected on Thursday. In Kabul, it was 55, though with the windchill factored in it was only--let me see now--54. . . .

So where did this ""brutal Afghan winter"" business come from? It came, pre-eminently, from spokespersons from the relief agencies. There are some special-interest groups--the National Rifle Association, Right To Life--whose press releases get dismissed by the media as propaganda, and others--environmental groups, for example--whose every claim is taken at face value. Into this last happy category fall the ""humanitarian lobby.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Next headline to watch for: ""Global Warming Blamed for Hot Afghan Winter.""

Our Friends the Afghans  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/01/09/ret.afghanistan.campaign/index.html

Officials of the new Afghan government say that seven top Taliban officials, including the ""justice minister,"" were freed after surrendering in Kandahar. A Foreign Ministry spokesman ""conceded the seven may have fled the country and said the interim government is investigating who let them go and why,"" CNN reports.

More al Qaeda Prisoners  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16596-2002Jan8.html

American forces have captured two senior al Qaeda fighters near Tora Bora, the Washington Post reports. ""While declining to identify the men, Gen. Richard B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters they were considered important enough to be transferred to a detention facility in the southern city of Kandahar, where U.S. authorities have been interrogating suspected al Qaeda and Taliban members.""

Meanwhile,  CNN  http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/central/01/08/ret.afghan.attacks/index.html  reports that  Ibn Al-Shaykh al-Libi  http://www.fbi.gov/mostwant/terrorists/teralliby.htm , the most senior Qaeda man captured so far, has been ""most cooperative."" Also cooperative, according to a  Tehelka.com  http://www.tehelka.com/channels/currentaffairs/2002/jan/8/ca010802karachi.htm  report: Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the erstwhile Taliban ambassador to Pakistan.

The CNN report adds that Gen. Myers says, in CNN's words, that ""U.S. officials believe they have thwarted some terrorist attacks with intelligence gathered during the military campaign in Afghanistan,"" though Myers didn't get specific.

Osama's Strategist  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-010902zubeida.story

The Los Angeles Times reports that America is ""pursuing one man as intensely as Osama bin Laden himself--an elusive Palestinian who [officials] believe has been entrusted with keeping the terrorist organization's global network of cells alive and operational"":

*** QUOTE ***

Authorities are also aggressively pursuing the theory that Abu Zubeida, whose real name is Zain AlAbidin Mohammed Husain, is the ""operational link"" connecting Bin Laden and others who conceived the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks with the hijackers who carried them out.

Abu Zubeida, thought to be about 30, could well be at Bin Laden's side as he tries to elude a global dragnet. But unlike Bin Laden and his aide Ayman Zawahiri, whose movements are limited by their high profiles, Abu Zubeida may have slipped out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan or almost anywhere else to activate new plots and try to regroup Al Qaeda forces, authorities fear.

Abu Zubeida's role makes him a higher priority than even Zawahiri, who authorities say is more of a theoretician. Since the reported death in November of Mohammed Atef, Abu Zubeida is believed to have taken on the added role of Al Qaeda's chief military strategist, according to U.S. officials and counterterrorism experts.

*** END QUOTE ***

Where's Osama?  http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=08012002-104005-7340r

""We believe he is still alive but has probably slipped out of Afghanistan into Pakistan,"" UPI quotes Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, chairman of the Intelligence Committee, as saying. The  Financial Times  http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3LK5Y58WC  reports that the U.S. military has gained Pakistani approval to pursue the enemy into Pakistan, ""a substantial concession by the country's military forces, which have maintained extensive patrols of the 1,500-mile frontier.""  Rediff.com  http://www.rediff.com/us/2002/jan/09ny1.htm , meanwhile, quotes an unnamed ""top Indian official"" as saying that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence may be sheltering the al Qaeda boss.

Impatient Patient  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16459-2002Jan8.html

Remember those hospitalized Arab prisoners who were threatening to blow themselves up at a hospital in Kandahar? One of them made good on the threat, possibly to avoid starvation:

*** QUOTE ***

The local Afghan commander at the scene and other knowledgeable officials said U.S. Special Forces had ordered the starving out of the Arab patients, who had rendered themselves unapproachable by strapping explosives to their bodies.

""This was the commander of the Americans' order, not to give them any food,"" said Hafiz Ulah, the anti-Taliban commander overseeing the standoff. ""The only reason this man could be trying to escape was hunger.""

At the U.S. military base outside Kandahar, a Marine spokesman said he had no information about whether Special Forces in the area had ordered such a tactic.

The siege has brought sharp criticism from the senior Red Cross official here, who meets regularly with the Special Forces commanders who by several accounts ordered the siege.

""Understanding that it's a difficult situation, for sure--a military situation--basic humanitarian principles should be observed,"" said Gian-Battista Bacchetta, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation here. ""You can't starve people out.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Tell ya what, Gian-Battista: Why don't you feed them?

Great Moments in Non-Western Civilization  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/09/wsaud09.xml

Our friends the Saudis have demolished an Ottoman fortress in Mecca that dates from 1780, London's Daily Telegraph reports: ""The Ajyad fortress, which stood on the Bulbul hill overlooking the Grand Mosque in Mecca, was bulldozed a week ago to make way for a major housing project, which includes a luxury hotel.""

Turkish officials liken the demolition to the Taliban's infamous destruction last year of the Buddha statues at Bamiyan. Says Turkey's Culture Minister Istemihan Talay: ""It has once again become clear that the source of the Taliban mentality is Saudi Arabia."" Indeed.

Yasser, He Did It  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A16937-2002Jan8.html

Columnist Michael Kelly has a useful summary of the facts about the arms-smuggling ship Israel seized last week: ""The evidence is close to overwhelming that the Karine A mission was financed and organized at the highest levels of the Palestinian Authority, most likely sanctioned by Arafat himself--and that Arafat allowed the mission to proceed after he called for cessation of all armed actions against Israel on Dec. 16.""

Homer Simpson, Terrorist?  http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=topnews&StoryID=502776

A laid-off worker at a nuclear plant allegedly made terrorist threats against the facility, the San Onofre plant in San Juan Capastrano, Calif. The unnamed man who allegedly made the undisclosed threats is behind bars.

Impersonating a Cap  http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/38598.htm

""Money-grubbing street vendors"" near ground zero are selling counterfeit merchandise bearing the logos of the New York City police and fire department, ""sickening the families of the heroes who died there on Sept. 11 and even some of the tourists lining up for a glimpse of the devastation,"" the New York Post reports:

*** QUOTE ***

At least a half-dozen hucksters were pushing their wares yesterday, including one who set up on Broadway--directly across from the walkway that leads to the platform--and a cluster on Barclay Street. In addition to watercolors of the fallen skyscrapers, flag-themed scarves and postcard books for sale, there were hats, T-shirts and headbands with the logos of the Fire Department and Police Department.

But unlike the department-approved shops that sell licensed goods and funnel the proceeds back to charity, the ground zero hucksters and their bosses pocket the profits they make off the knockoffs.

*** END QUOTE ***

Police have arrested 115 vendors and issued 179 summonses, and they're ""gearing up to start seizing counterfeit-logo merchandise from vendors in the next couple of weeks.""

Sharf on the Scarf
About  yesterday's item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001700#scarf  on the Muslim girl who was ordered to remove her headscarf at the airport in Baltimore, reader Joshua Sharf writes:

*** QUOTE ***

My wife and I are Orthodox Jews, and my wife keeps her hair covered in public. She will tuck her hair up, under either a hat and a half-wig (called a fall), or under a full wig (called a sheitl). The wig and half-wig need to be pinned on, and every time through airport security, even prior to Sept. 11, these pins would set off the metal detector. After refusing to remove her hat and wig in public, my wife was, is, and will be, escorted to a private room by security, where female guards examine her hair.

So, you guys are wrong in saying that the girl should have to take off her scarf in public. And the Council on American Islamic Relations is wrong in not suggesting this oft-used alternative.

*** END QUOTE ***

We actually saw someone from CAIR make this suggestion in a CNN segment earlier today, but the group's initial e-mail bulletin on the subject made no mention of this sensible alternative.

How the Democrats Have Changed  http://www.usnews.com/usnews/issue/020114/politics/14pol.htm

U.S. News & World Report's Michael Barone, one of the best political analysts around, discusses how the two parties have changed. While Republicans have rallied around President Bush, who has managed to marry ""leave us alone"" and ""national greatness"" conservatism, two types of Democrats have gone nearly extinct: ""blame-America-first Democrats"" and ""new Democrats.""

""The Democrats,"" Barone writes, ""have become a party out of the New Deal era--patriotic on foreign policy, statist domestically."" On foreign policy he's indisputably right: The Congressional Surrender Caucus has exactly one member, Rep. Barbara Lee of California.

There may be room for debate, however, on how uniformly statist the Dems are on economic policy. A ""political memo"" in today's  New York Times  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/politics/09DEMS.html  (link requires registration) poses the question--also put forth in today's  Wall Street Journal editorial  http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001702  (link also requires registration): If Tom Daschle thinks President Bush's tax cuts were so bad, why isn't he calling for their repeal. The Times doesn't mean this as a rhetorical question:

*** QUOTE ***

Just listen to a few of the 12 Senate Democrats who voted for the cut.

Senator Zell Miller of Georgia is openly questioning the political smarts of his party leader and bristles at Mr. Daschle's charge that the tax cut probably likely worsened the recession.

""Maybe it's at a level that my brain can't reach,"" Mr. Miller said. ""How do you have as one of your highest priorities to re-elect the moderate Democrats from South Dakota, Montana and Missouri on one hand, then on the other hand blame them for voting for a tax cut that he maintains has created this recession? Hello?""

Senators John B. Breaux of Louisiana and Dianne Feinstein of California have defended their votes on television talks shows.

And Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey said today that he might have reconsidered his vote for the tax cut last spring--had he known the country was about to face a terror strike, war and recession.

Even so, Mr. Torricelli said, ""I think to advance changing the tax reduction legislation in the midst of recession isn't good economics and it's worse politics.""

Class of '48, Crass of '02  http://slate.msn.com/?id=2060364&entry=2060456

Erstwhile New York Times columnist Anthony Lewis emerges from retirement for a Slate ""Kitchen Table"" chat with National Journal's Stuart Taylor. One of the topics turns out to be Monday's  Wall Street Journal editorial  http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001694  on the contretemps between Harvard president Lawrence Summers and Afro-American studies poseur Cornel West.

The extreme critics, like the Wall Street Journal, really pine for the days when there were few or no blacks at Harvard, when the undergraduates were largely stamped from the same upper-class and middle-class mold. That's the way it was when I was an undergraduate. Believe me, it is much better now. The students are far smarter and far more interesting. There are lots from outside the United States and quite a few with skin tones other than pink. I doubt that you, Stuart, would want to go back to the old days.

*** END QUOTE ***
 
The editorial from which Lewis draws this conclusion is in fact a rousing endorsement of diversity. It praises Summers for an inaugural speech that ""embraced, with great warmth, the principle of inclusiveness in its description of Harvard as a place where men and women of all faiths, races and classes were welcome,"" that ""addressed with passion the importance of equal opportunity,"" and that made clear that ""able students should be welcome to all the university's professional schools, regardless of their financial circumstances."" It criticizes only the use of ""affirmative action""--that is, selective lowering of standards, based on race or ethnicity--as a means of promoting diversity.

How does Lewis come up with such a tendentious interpretation? Well, consider the era in which he came of age. He graduated form Harvard in 1948--six years before Brown v. Board of Education, 16 years before the Civil Rights Act, the year Strom Thurmond ran for president as a segregationist candidate, and 20 years before George Wallace's similar third-party campaign. When Lewis was a freshly minted Harvard graduate, and for at least two decades thereafter, it was true that many people who rejected the liberal view of racial matters did so for invidious reasons.

But the world has changed since 1948. Elite opinion is now unanimous, and popular opinion nearly so, that black Americans are entitled to equality. Today's racial conservatism holds that the government and other institutions should be colorblind--a liberal view by 1948 standards. Today's liberalism holds that remedial measures are necessary to compensate for past injustices. That's a defensible view, but one that should be defended on its own merits. Instead, people like Lewis invoke a moral authority that began to become obsolete sometime around 1970. Today's racial liberalism, they claim, is the legacy of yesteryear's, and those who oppose affirmative action are really segregationists at heart.

Aside from being dishonest and divisive, this approach promotes a view of black Americans that is patronizing at best. It's telling that Lewis, while praising the genuine scholars in Harvard's Afro-American studies department--Anthony Appiah, Henry Louis Gates and William Julius Wilson--demurs from expressing an opinion about West, saying only that he is ""an original, and I do not want to get into the war over his work"" and that Summers's criticism of him was politically ill-advised. Such delicacy toward West is striking by contrast with Lewis's smug denunciation of the Journal's editors.

Plagiarism Was My Idea!  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/opinion/09BORO.html

In the New York Times (link requires registration), Andy Borowitz weighs in hilariously on Stephen Ambrose's alleged plagiarism:

*** QUOTE ***

Last week, several journalists accused me of plagiarizing entire passages in my most recent novel, ""The Red Badge of Gatsby.""

My accusers claim that in this book, my 27th in the last three years, I lifted sections from, among other sources, ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" ""War and Peace,"" ""Pride and Prejudice,"" ""Goldfinger,"" ""Go, Dog. Go!"" and the Lands' End holiday catalog.

Friends have urged me to follow the example of another celebrated author who recently responded to similar allegations with a public apology. I must remind them, however, that copying what other writers have already done is exactly what got me into this mess.

Oh Deer  http://www.bowsite.org/bowsite/menu/NEWS/GETNEWS.CFM?ID=227

Bowsite.com, a specialty Web site for bow-hunting aficionados, reports on how a People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals stunt backfired:

*** QUOTE ***

For safety's sake, hunters in Ohio are required by law to display at least 400 square inches of hunter's blaze orange on their person when in the woods. Capitalizing on the fact that hunters do not usually shoot orange, PETA recently bulk purchased blaze orange vests and have been affixing them to live-trapped deer in Youngstown suburbs. According to PETA spokesperson Katie Reese, a total of 405 vests were successfully put into circulation prior to this week, with additional specimens still being caught and vested.

Youngtown entrepreneur Guy Lockey, of Guy's Outdoors has spit in the face of PETA by offering rewards for the returned vests this week. Hunters who can successfully bag a vested deer can pay $5 for random and biggest animal awards. As of Tuesday, 308 of the vests had already been recorded as bagged with most of the hunters registering for Mr. Lockey's drawing.

It's so easy, you can see them coming a mile away"" said one first year hunter after checking in his first spike buck.

Shales Deposit  http://www.emonline.com/shales/010702shales.html

In a column that doesn't appear in the Washington Post, Washington Post TV critic Tom Shales attempts a rant against Bernard Goldberg, author of "" Bias: A CBS Insider Explains How the Media Distort the News  http://www.bennettandcurran.com/cgi-bin/Shopper.exe?preadd=action&key=0895261901 ."" The piece, alas, doesn't rise to the level of a rant; it's more of a tantrum. But it is unintentionally hilarious in places. Here's our favorite:

*** QUOTE ***

Obviously hoping to follow in the footsteps of Rush Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly, two intellectual giants by comparison, Goldberg has fashioned his rantings into a book succinctly titled ""Bias,"" which, appropriately enough, won the dubious honor of a commendatory editorial from  The Wall Street Journal  http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001669 . And we all know how unbiased those Journal editorials are. Gosh it is soooo hard to figure out where they're coming from.

*** END QUOTE ***

Hey Tom, you silly goose, editorials are supposed to be biased!

"FLASH ALERT: Don't fall for Technology's biggest LIE...","Dear Investor,

I'm writing to expose the biggest lie in technology
today...

...one that has individual investors completely in the
dark about an opportunity of immense proportions.  A
LOW-RISK tech stock that can easily DOUBLE your money
by this time next year -- then make your fortune
several times over in the years to come.

I've just put the finishing touches on an Urgent
Profit Bulletin detailing this opportunity
and in just a bit, I'll tell you how to get your
FREE copy.

But first, back to technology's biggest lie.  I'm
talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic
cable.  Here's the REAL story:

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet
slowed down -- very noticeably slowed down.  In fact,
it nearly came to a grinding halt!  That means there
isn't nearly enough capacity or redundancy built into
the system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried
about this problem.  After all, this is the second
time it's happened.  Back in July, a tunnel fire in
Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems -- and therefore
our economy -- are very, very vulnerable.

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered.  But today,
commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those
systems.  Virtually nothing moves without it.  That's
how banks and brokerages transfer funds...how
dispatchers route fleets of trucks...how many Americans
get paid through direct deposit.

And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than 99.9% of
Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one
example.

Qwest -- one of America's biggest carriers -- recently
said they're 60% loaded on their network.  That
doesn't sound too bad...until you understand how these
networks operate.  You can't load a network much past
65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually CATASTROPHIC --
because the network spends so much time searching for
open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually
sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation
comes to a standstill.

AMERICA IS FALLING BEHIND the rest of the developed
world.  Internet traffic systems currently run faster
in Australia, Europe and even South America.  That's
because we push out more data than everyone else --
but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the
needed rate.

We've got to catch up -- and we've got to catch up
fast!  Otherwise business, the economy and our
national security all go in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a
""fiber glut?""  Because  95% of all the fiber that has
ever been laid is ""dark"" -- that is, it's not
activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1
supplier of the components needed to do the job.  I'm
looking at a DOUBLE -- possibly a TRIPLE by this time
next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our money
five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly
has ""ten-bagger"" potential!

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was
nearly 20-times higher.  So what changed?  Spending on
communications networks dried up.  Now the government
is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending
into the economy; interest rates are practically zero;

if you miss out. Get this company's name -- and full
details -- in my urgent profit bulletin: 5-Times

TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS
OUT on.  This stock has a long ways to run -- but it's
already UP 41% since October 1st, in recognition of
this company's vital new role in national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is
strained to the limits.  And get this -- data traffic
is DOUBLING every year now.  That means a network
running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the
fiber must be lit.  That's why the fiber will be lit.
Click here to take advantage of this opportunity now.

JITTERS IN EUROPE

ITALY'S foreign minister, Renato Ruggiero, resigned after several other
senior ministers had made hostile remarks about the EU and the euro,
and Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, failed to slap them down.
Some European leaders feared Italy's government would turn
Eurosceptical. No way, said Mr Berlusconi, who took on the foreign
ministry himself. But it was clear Italy would defend its national
interests more strongly.

- - - - - See article: Will Italy really change its policy toward the European Union?
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZS0Au

Goran Persson, Sweden's prime minister, said his country might hold a
REFERENDUM ON THE EURO next year. Polls suggest that Swedish public
opinion, hitherto hostile, has recently swung in favour of joining the
single currency.

ESTONIA'S market-minded coalition government, led by Mart Laar,
collapsed.

FRANCE'S family doctors stayed on intermittent strike, amid increasing
signs that the government would surrender to their pay demands.

In SPAIN, government-imposed reforms to the country's universities came
formally into force, despite the protests of many academics and
students.

FORCE FOR PEACE

A British-led, UN-mandated, international force designed to provide
security in AFGHANISTAN, was gradually building up to a strength of
4,000-5,000. Turkey and Bulgaria were the latest countries to promise
soldiers. Meanwhile, America said that it intended to build a long-term
Central Asian base in Kirgizstan.

American forces took prisoner 364 men said to be members of the TALIBAN
or the al-Qaeda organisation and proposed to fly them to a camp in the
American base at Guantanamo in Cuba, for questioning. Afghan tribal
leaders protested at the deaths of civilians killed by American bombs,
said to outnumber the 3,000 people who died in New York on September
11th.

In an effort to please India, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan
dropped the term ""freedom fighters"" in a reference to attacks in
Indian-held KASHMIR and said he rejected all terrorism. But India
continued to build up its forces on its border with Pakistan.

- - - - - See article: Islam in Pakistan
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZU0Aw

The Pakistani authorities found 630kg (1,390lb) of HEROIN being carried
by a camel caravan in the south-east of the country, one of the largest
seizures of the drug.

MYANMAR'S military government freed five opposition members, including
a cousin of Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader.

A peace-making team from Norway arrived in SRI LANKA at the start of a
new effort to end the 18-year civil war between the separatist Tamil
Tigers and the government.

SHRINKING SURPLUS

As estimates of America's long-term fiscal surplus shrank, Tom Daschle,
the Democratic Senate majority leader, accused President George Bush of
MISHANDLING THE ECONOMY by pushing through last year's $1.35 trillion
tax cuts. Mr Bush promised that ""not over my dead body"" will the
Democrats raise taxes.

- - - - - See article: A battle over numbers
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZW0Ay

The Supreme Court reduced the scope of the AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES
ACT by ruling that an impairment must have a significant effect on a
person's daily life in order to qualify as a disability under the law.
The controversial ruling could make it harder for people with
afflictions such as carpal-tunnel syndrome (repetitive-strain injury)
to get special treatment from their employers.

The Bush administration said it may need to resume UNDERGROUND NUCLEAR
TESTING at some point to maintain the safety of its scaled-back
nuclear-weapons arsenal. The option would form part of the
""nuclear-posture review"", which outlines the country's justification
for reducing the number of strategic warheads by two-thirds over the
next ten years.

GOING DOWN

ARGENTINA devalued the peso by 29%25 for most trade and capital
transactions. For other purposes, the currency will float. Eduardo
Duhalde's government converted most dollar loans to pesos, but has said
dollar bank deposits will (eventually) be honoured. Critics feared that
the banking system would collapse.

- - - - - See article: Argentina's bankrupt economy
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZX0Az

CHILE'S president, Ricardo Lagos, appointed as defence minister
Michelle Bachelet, a member of his Socialist party and the daughter of
an air-force general who died after being imprisoned and tortured
during General Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. She is the first woman
defence minister in Latin America.

COLOMBIA'S three-year peace process came to a halt. President Andres
Pastrana gave the FARC guerrillas 48 hours to leave their
""demilitarised"" zone, after they had refused to drop their opposition
to military surveillance of the zone.

BY HOOK OR BY CROOK

ZIMBABWE'S PARLIAMENT was set to pass laws to prevent the presidential
election, due on March 9th and 10th, from being free or fair, or being
won by anyone other than Robert Mugabe. Making doubly sure, the army
chief hinted that he would not recognise the opposition candidate,
Morgan Tsvangirai, if he won.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eRp0UBQN0T70qZZ0A2

A senior aide to NIGERIA'S chief judge was found dead, apparently
murdered. Bola Ige, the justice minister, was murdered last month.

The South African government promised to set up a commission of inquiry
into the COLLAPSE OF THE RAND. The country's currency lost 37%25 of its
value last year. South African businessmen have accused speculators of
foul play.

The government of BURUNDI promised to pull troops out of Congo in
return for a Congolese promise to stop supporting rebels in Burundi.

After a three-week diminution in the violence between ISRAEL AND THE
PALESTINIANS, Israel seized a ship allegedly carrying weapons to
Palestinian militias, and two Hamas gunmen attacked an army base,
killing four Israeli soldiers before they themselves died.

"Special FREE opportunity for aggressive investors","New sector fund ""Buy"" issued for Fabian Sector
Investing subscribers.  Get in now and enjoy the
next 30 day's profits FOR FREE!

Dear InvestorPlace.com Insights Reader,

There's usually a bull market going on somewhere, if
you know where to look!

The recent rally in several key market sectors
presents some enticing opportunities for those of you
who are willing to take a more aggressive investing
posture.  In fact, my last ""Buy"" recommendation -- in
the Tech Sector -- has already jumped 18% in just a
few short weeks.

I'm writing to you today to tell you that I've just
issued ANOTHER sector fund buy signal. Frankly, I'm
even MORE excited about this ""Buy"" than I was about
the last one.  It's in the Financial Services Sector,
and has the potential to be even bigger for us than
the Tech buy.  And I want to make sure that you DON'T
miss out!  That's why I convinced my publisher to give
you a chance to try my Sector Investing service --
FREE -- for 30 days.

That's right, as a special opportunity for
InvestorPlace.com Insights readers, now you can try
out Fabian Sector Investing for yourself without being
charged a penny for the next 30 days.  Just go to
 http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
and sign up for your free trial today.

You'll get immediate access to all the details on my
new Buy in the Financial Services Sector, PLUS you'll
get to invest in our recommended sector funds, read
our in-depth weekly sector analysis, and book yourself
some healthy sector profits.  If in thirty days you're
not absolutely thrilled with the service--and your
profits--simply call my Customer Service department at
800/950-8765 and let them know, and they'll make sure
your credit card is NEVER CHARGED EVEN A PENNY for
your free month of service.

I think you'll like what you see!

Since I introduced Fabian Sector Investing almost
three years ago, we have dramatically outperformed the
S&P500 and NASDAQ by pulling down major winners like...

*79% profits in INVESCO Technology in just 5 months

*30% profits in Fidelity Retailing in 6 months

*86% profits in INVESCO Leisure in less than 15 months

*20% profits in INVESCO Health in just 50 days

And these results were during a grinding bear market!
From today's depressed price levels, I expect that my
new sector buys will deliver EVEN GREATER profits in
the coming months. The 18%+ profits we racked up over
the past few weeks are just the beginning!

So, if sector investing profits like this sound like
they're right for you, just call 800/950-8765 or go to
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
to sign up for your 30 DAYS FREE of Fabian Sector
Investing today.

Sincerely,

Doug Fabian

P.S. Aggressive sector fund investing requires close
oversight and sometimes active trading.  But the
increased profit potential as compared to typical
mutual fund or stock investing really can be dramatic.
If you're interested in seeing what it's all about,
you'll NEVER get a better opportunity than this. To
get started with the program and lock-in maximum
profits, you must sign-up and make the new buys TODAY.
So please visit
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103
NOW to activate your 30-Day FREE TRIAL.

P. P. S.  Don't miss out!! We've already made more
than 18% in the past few weeks on our last sector buy.
You'll want to get in on the NEW buy right away.  Call
800/950-8765 now or go to
http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0XN103

Best of the Web Today - January 17, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
Bob Herbert's Flaming Pajamas  http://nytimes.com/2002/01/17/opinion/17HERB.html

New York Times columnist Bob Herbert (link requires registration) continues to fan the smoldering wreckage of Enron in hopes of igniting a political scandal. Last week, as  we noted  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001707#enron , he unsuccessfully tried to suggest that Enron had purchased influence from the Bush administration. Now, in a column taking aim at Sen. Phil Gramm and his wife, Wendy, he has discovered a new problem:

*** QUOTE ***

That problem is the obsession with deregulation that has had such a hold on the Republican Party and corporate America. . . . Who's left to look out for the small fry? If the deregulation zealots had their way, we'd be left with tainted food, unsafe cars, bridges collapsing into rivers, children's pajamas bursting into flames and a host of corporations far more rapacious and unscrupulous than they are now.

*** END QUOTE ***

Herbert asserts, though he fails to demonstrate, that deregulation, sought by Enron and instituted by Republican ""zealots,"" led to the company's downfall. Even if he were right, this would amount to a pretty convincing case there there's no political scandal here. Herbert is accusing Republicans merely of supporting policies with which he disagrees. There's nothing corrupt about that.

In any case, today's  Bob Novak  http://www.townhall.com/columnists/robertnovak/rn20020117.shtml  column gives the lie to Herbert's simpleminded view:

*** QUOTE ***

[Enron CEO Ken] Lay has been painted as a heartless advocate of free market economics when he actually was working behind the scenes for control of energy emissions, establishing alliances with the most radical environmentalist pressure groups. Just as Enron pushed electrical deregulation to make billions in energy trades, Lay wanted restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions under the Kyoto agreement to artificially create a market for CO2 ""credits"" to be purchased to burn coal. Enron was not about ideology and certainly not partisanship, but was using governmental contacts to maximize profits.

*** END QUOTE ***

Novak reports that Lay enlisted former senator Tim Wirth, a Colorado Democrat, to lobby Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill in favor of the Kyoto treaty--another example of the ineffectiveness of Enron's efforts to purchase influence in the Bush administration.

There's nothing particularly unusual about a company favoring regulation; a business enterprise is, by definition, not ""about ideology"" but about making a profit. Regulations often create business opportunities (as Kyoto would have for Enron) or act as a barrier to entry for potential competitors (since a big established company is more easily able to absorb the costs of regulation than a small upstart).

Herbert seems to understand none of this. His comic-book view of the world--in which white-hatted government regulators ""look out for small fry"" and battle evil corporate predators who hate all regulation--is so childlike, we can't help but hope his pajamas don't burst into flames amid his heated rhetoric.

We Don't Need No Education  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/17/business/17BUSH.html

The Times also reports (link requires registration) that Democrats are complaining of a ""significant conflict of interest,"" in the words of one Dem consultant, because White House economic adviser Lawrence Lindsey, who received a $50,000 consulting fee from Enron before joining the administration, conducted a study for the White House, beginning in mid-October, on the effects of a prospective Enron collapse on the overall economy. The most amusing part of this story, though, is the final two paragraphs:

*** QUOTE ***

Paul Krugman, an editorial columnist for The New York Times, said he was also paid $50,000 to serve on an Enron advisory board in 1999. He disclosed his connection in a Jan. 24, 2001,  column  http://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/24/opinion/24KRUG.html  about Enron.

""This was an advisory panel that had no function that I was aware of,"" Mr. Krugman said today. ""My later interpretation is that it was all part of the way they built an image. All in all, I was just another brick in the wall.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Krugman, who is also an economics professor at a university  in or near Texas  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001404#krugman , quit his Enron gig when he joined the Times.

The New Generation Gap  http://www.sptimes.com/2002/01/16/TampaBay/Students_support_Al_A.shtml

The University of South Florida recently fired Sami Al-Arian, a tenured Palestinian Arab computer-science professor who has become notorious for anti-Israel comments and who has been investigated for, though never charged with, links to terror organizations. Last week the  statewide faculty union  http://tampatrib.com/FloridaMetro/MGAEUJDKBWC.html  followed suit early this week.

USF students, however, see things differently. The USF student senate voted unanimously to support the firing. The St. Petersburg Times reports:

*** QUOTE ***

They said they want people to stop calling their school ""Terrorism University,"" ""Jihad U."" and the ""University of Suicidal Fanatics.""

""What does this say about our school?"" said student Kaylin Grey, who is applying for law school. ""When I graduate, I want my degree to mean something.""

*** END QUOTE ***

There's something to be said for the pro-Al-Arian position, repugnant though his views on the Middle East are. Professors shouldn't be fired for their political opinions; if they were, faculties would be even more uniformly left-liberal than they are today. But the student-faculty split at USF is fascinating. College students have been fighting political correctness on campus for well over a decade, but usually alone or in small groups, with outside support from conservative organizations and sometimes the ACLU. With war reminding young people of the importance of patriotism and national unity, we may be seeing the first stirrings of a nationwide anti-PC revolt.

Saudi Sob Stories  http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-000004452jan17.story

Austrians, as reader S.E. Brenner points out, sometimes make the risible and rather offensive claim that they were the Nazis' ""first victims."" Now the Saudis are up to something similar. Today's Los Angeles Times carries a dispatch from Riyadh entitled ""Saudis Feel Unfairly Tarred With a Terrorist Brush."" It quotes Saudis who don't believe that Saudi native Osama bin Laden was behind the attacks and who accuse the U.S. of failing to provide ""proof"" that 15 of the Sept. 11 hijackers were Saudi citizens.

And just in case the Nazi analogy seems strained, the Times also quotes Saudis who blame the Jews for everything: "" 'All Saudis like Americans,' said Abdelaziz, a businessman who requested that his full name not be used. 'But as Arabs we do not like the American government. We believe it is controlled by the Zionists. The government works to destroy the Arabs. Is it true? I don't know; it is what we believe.' ""

USA Today  http://www.usatoday.com/news/comment/2002/01/17/ncguest1.htm , meanwhile, lets a Saudi national and U.S. resident named Sulaiman Al-Hattlan take nearly 1,100 words to sound off on his ""nightmare"" flying from Riyadh back to Boston by way of Geneva and Frankfurt. Here's a sample:

*** QUOTE ***

I even imagined how humiliated I would be if the FBI arrested me at the airport, and I hoped, if that happened, my seatmates from the flight wouldn't see me being escorted by FBI agents. The worst part of this nightmare was that I had to convince myself that the FBI has the right to suspect that someone ""like me"" could be linked to terrorism. Consider the identifying characteristics of the 19 suspected hijackers of the four American airplanes on Sept. 11. Some of them looked just like me, and worst of all, several came from my province in the southwest of Saudi Arabia. . . .

On my Lufthansa flight from Frankfurt to Boston, I sat very quietly, reading the Financial Times, wondering whether reading the Times might cause suspicion. I made sure not to look around or try to use the bathroom. My usual excitement on airplanes was gone. I did not immediately talk to the passengers next to me, nor did I dare ask the flight attendant for a glass of water. Soon enough, I slept, or pretended to sleep. . . .

Though I always try to be polite, this time I felt I was trying too hard and smiling too much. Would that make someone think I am a terrorist? All of a sudden I asked myself why I should have to fear others, and myself, when I am fully certain that I have nothing to do with terrorism, except my terror of terrorism itself. I had failed to realize that I am, too, a victim of terrorism.

*** END QUOTE ***

The entire article is about Al-Hattlan's inner turmoil over the possibility that he might be embarrassed or humiliated by someone who takes him for a potential terrorist. There's not a word to suggest that anything of the sort actually happened. Well, gee, Sulaiman, flying is a little nerve-racking for all of us these days--and there are scarier things that can happen on an airplane than being eyed suspiciously by fellow passengers or even being hauled off by the FBI. Suck it up, buddy.

Arafat's Blood Libel  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/iapinfo/message/2584

The Islamic Association for Palestine reports that Nobel Peace Prize laureate Yasser Arafat ""has accused the Israeli apartheid regime of murdering Palestinian children and youths and extricating their vital organs for organ transplants."" Arafat told al-Jazeera television: ""They murder our kids and use their organs as spare parts.""

A Convenient Fire  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/160102/dlfor15.asp

""A 16-storey government ministry building reportedly containing sensitive records on extremist religious organisations was almost completely gutted in the Pakistani capital, police said Wednesday,"" Agence France-Presse reports from Islamabad. ""Authorities said it appeared a fire, which started on the upper floors, was caused by a short circuit but were not ruling out other causes.""

Too bad those Pakistani buildings aren't built from the same material they use to make Bob Herbert's regulated pajamas.

Domestic Terror Bust  http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-011702sla.story

Four erstwhile members of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the 1970s terrorist group that kidnapped Patricia Hearst, have been arrested and charged with the 1975 murder of Myrna Opsahl, a church volunteer, in a 1975 Sacramento, Calif., bank robbery. One of the alleged murderers is Kathleen Soliah, a k a ""Sara Jane Olson,"" who has already pleaded guilty in another terrorist attack. The Los Angeles Times reports: ""The timing of the arrests provoked questions, coming just two days before Olson's sentencing on charges of planting a bomb under a Los Angeles police car in 1975. The bomb never exploded."" The paper doesn't say who asked the questions the timing ""provoked,"" nor does it say just what the questions were.

The  New York Times  http://nytimes.com/2002/01/17/national/17ARRE.html  (link requires registration) reports that one of the defendants, Bill Harris, was asked in an interview last year how he'd changed over the years. ""I'm older, no longer self-destructive and unwilling to go to jail,"" he said. ""We were a bunch of amateurs. I wish everyone would forget us."" But Myrna Opsahl deserves justice, even justice delayed, just as  Medgar Evers  http://www.newstimes.com/archive97/dec2397/naa.htm  did.

The FBI is denying yesterday's New York Post report that it has taken over the investigation of Chandra Levy's disappearance from the Washington, D.C., police, the Washington Post reports. ""There has been nothing new,"" a U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman tells the Washington Post. ""I have no idea what the impetus for that story was."" Maybe just an overeager effort on the tabloid's part to get back to normal four months after Sept. 11.

At least the New York Post has Monica Lewinsky. The tabloid reports she nearly broke down in front of reporters as she was promoting her new HBO documentary, ""Monica in Black and White"":

Lewinsky stumbled through a series of polite questions but came unglued when asked about the crude jokes that have dogged her for four years.

""There's a difference between a pleasant joke and a personal joke,"" Lewinsky told a gathering of TV critics.

""The ones that take my last name and equate them to [a sex act] that a lot of people in the world do, is a really cruel thing to do.""

Back to Normal--III  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/16/national/16PASS.html

At the New York Times (links require registration), they're definitely getting back to normal. Specifically, they've resumed their interwar-era habit of running frequent and odd reports related to homosexuality--though with a Sept. 11 twist. Today's Times has a feature on Mark Bingham, one of the heroes of Flight 93. Bingham, a 6-foot-5 rugby player and PR man, was gay, and his story is an inspiring one, as well as a withering rejoinder to Jerry Falwell, who famously blamed homosexuals (among others) for the Sept. 11 atrocities. The Times' take on Bingham, though, is a peculiar one. The headline says it all: ""Passenger on Jet: Gay Hero or Hero Who Was Gay?"" Apparently in some circles this is an important distinction.
 
We first noticed the resumption of the Times' gay coverage on Sunday, when the paper ran a piece entitled "" Gay Muslims Face a Growing Challenge  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/13/nyregion/13GAY.html ."" Hmm, are they gay Muslims or Muslims who are gay?

Not as Hungry as We Thought  http://www.thesmokinggun.com/doc_o_day/kerkorian3.shtml

Because of an error in the Reuters story we linked to, yesterday's item on Lisa Kirkorian's child-support request overstated the amount she was seeking for food by an order of magnitude. The correct sum is $10,220 a month--$4,300 for ""food at home and household supplies"" and $5,920 for ""eating out""--not $102,000.

The Smoking Gun has the actual document itemizing Kirkorian's account of three-year-old Kira's monthly expenses. Among them is $945 for ""telephone."" Assuming $45 of that goes for local service, and Kira has a 10-cent-a-minute long-distance plan, this three-year-old is spending roughly 12 1/2 hours a day on the phone. Mrs. Kirkorian also requests $2,885 for ""car lease payments (including license and registration fees). Kira apparently has two BMWs. She must need a backup in case of an accident--which is pretty likely when a three-year-old is driving!

 League City to start hearings on center

            By: JENNIFER THOMAS, Citizen Staff December 26, 2001

      Three public hearings have been scheduled to discuss the League City
Community Center referendum that's up for voter approval in a special
election on Feb. 2.

      Voters will be asked to approve a $12.8 million community center,
equipped with an indoor competitive pool, outdoor recreational pool, weight
room, gymnasium and other amenities.
      Ian Powell of SHW Group, Inc., the architectural engineering firm
designing the facility, will be conducting the hearings, along with
representatives from the League City Parks Department.
      The first hearing is scheduled for Wednesday, Jan. 2, at the Clear
Creek High School Ninth Grade Center, located at 2451 E. Main St., at 6:30
p.m.
      The second hearing will be Thursday, Jan. 10 at Creekside Intermediate
School, 4320 E. Main St., at 6:30 p.m.
      The last hearing will be held at the Johnny Arolfo Civic Center,
located on Walker, just next to City Hall, Tuesday, Jan. 29, at 6 p.m.
      The community center is the second phase of a project that started with
the construction of the Sportsplex.
      Two sites are under consideration for the proposed community center;
the land across from City Hall, and Walter Hall Park off FM 270.
      Funding for construction of the community center will come from the 1/4
cent sales tax that was passed to help pay for the construction of the
Sportsplex, from Certificates of Obligation, and from the city's General
Fund.
      Membership fees, user fees, and rental costs will pay for operations
and maintenance.

Questions abound about community center

By Alicia Gooden
The Daily News

Published January 04, 2002

If the public's overall impression of the first public hearing on a proposed
community center is indicative of the February vote, the measure might face
an uphill battle.

""I think it lacked sufficient information to have a good, reasonable vote on
the issue,"" said J.A. Willhern, a League City resident.

A good portion of the small, vocal group that showed up Thursday night for
the hearing sent an overt message to city leaders - too many questions, not
enough answers.

From the onset of the meeting, Mayor Tommy Frankovich asked that the hearing
be one that set aside personal and political stances on the $12.8 million
project. By the end of the hearing, it was evident that the Feb. 2 election
would come down to which wheel squeaked the loudest.

Most of the comments made during the 90-minute hearing dealt with how the
project would be funded, who would use the facilities, where the community
center would be built and how much financial burden League City residents
would be asked to shoulder.

Residents like Fred Lawrence, Karl Silverman and Elaine Kosty hurled
questions at City Administrator Nick Finan and project consultant Ian Powell
about the specifics of the project. The questions probed how realistic the
city's estimation was that the yearly maintenance costs for the 64,000
square-foot center would cost just $825,000.

The total estimated cost of the project is $12.8 million. Of that amount,
$9.4 million in certificate of obligation would have to be sold. Other
funding sources would come from property taxes, 4B sales taxes and any grants
the city could secure.

Also asked of city leaders was how much more out-of-area swim teams would be
charged as compared to those aquatic teams inside the city and how much the
listed additions such as a child care center and second gymnasium would cost.
A shared concern among many who do not support the project or are undecided
is that the center is really for the swim teams, many of which are outside of
League City and Galveston County.

Throughout the questioning, however, Finan and other city officials remained
poised.

Yet, some of the queries posed stumped city officials. Those in attendance
wanted to know how much of the $825,000 included salaries and benefits for
the staff needed to run the community center and how many people would be on
staff.

Though city officials said they had the information, it was not available at
the meeting, a point that many commented on afterward.

""How can you have a public hearing and not have the information the public
wants?"" asked resident Jeff Mallios.

But the criticisms and negative intonations were buoyed somewhat by Teresa
Toungate, a parent with the swim team League City Barracudas.

Toungate, to applause from park board members and those in support of the
project, told the crowd that the community center would bring an influx of
economic development to the city.

""There are more than 1,000 families that come to these competitions
sometimes,"" she said. ""These families are going to eat at our McDonald's,
Esteban's (a local restaurant) and spend money at our little stores.""

One of those expressing concern over the cost of the project said that League
City had no major retailers, only ""little stores"" to help offset the cost of
the community center, which will feature a 50-meter, Olympic-size swimming
pool.

A chance to dive into the issue

By Stephen Hadley
The Daily News

Published January 03, 2002

There's something about a swimming pool that stirs the proverbial political
pot in a community.

In League City, there is a plan to build a $9.4 million community center that
includes an Olympic-size swimming pool and meeting rooms. The hitch is that
voters have to approve the proposal before it becomes reality. They'll head
to the polls on Feb. 2.

But before they do, the city plans to address questions and concerns about
the project during three public hearings. The first is tonight.

Some of the questions city leaders should answer concern where the proposed
center is going to be built and how much it's going to cost to use it.

Opponents of the deal have voiced both concerns.

Experts hired by the city say the center should be built closer to city hall,
not on county-owned land at Walter Hall Park as is now planned. Some
opponents have questioned whether the center would pose an environmental
threat to Clear Creek if it were built at the park. That's a dialogue city
leaders should have with citizens starting at tonight's meeting.

Is Walter Hall Park the best site for a community center? The intent of
putting it there was so that it would be centrally located, accessible to
residents in League City and people who live in the burgeoning Clear Lake
area.

How much it will cost to use the center has been a point of contention from
the project's infancy. Even the county commissioners, when they agreed to
allow the city to use the park for the center, questioned whether the cost -
$450 a year for a family of four or $2 a day to use the pool - was too much.
They worried whether those who can't afford such rates would be kept from
using a public pool. That's another legitimate question city leaders should
answer tonight.

If the early campaigning is any indication, there probably will be many more
questions this evening.

If you care about the issue, this is one hearing not to miss.

Center election divides community

By Alicia Gooden
The Daily News

Published January 06, 2002

LEAGUE CITY - In three weeks, voters will head to the polls to decide whether
to build a $12.8 million community center in the city.

Supporters say the center could be a tool for economic development, a nucleus
for the League City community and the magnet that attracts national
cheerleading and swimming competitions.

Those who oppose the project say that the city is trying to force all of
League City's residents to pay for a multi-million center that would be used
by a select few, most notably the area's swim leagues

If Thursday's public hearing was any indication, residents are divided over
the project and have plenty of questions.

Whether the measure passes or fails on Feb. 2 could largely hinge on how well
city officials explain the details of paying for the center and just who will
be footing that bill.



Paying the Piper

The cost of the 64,000 square-foot building, which will include an
Olympic-size swimming pool and several meeting rooms, is estimated to be
$12.8 million.

The city has secured $2 million for the project. The rest of the money will
come from the issuance of $9.4 million in certificates of obligation. The
original bond amount was $7.6 million but had to be raised to $9.4 million in
order to cover building costs.

Taxpayers will pay for the maintenance and operations cost of the center in
its first three years through revenue from the general fund, which includes
property taxes, franchise fees and possibly an increase in sales tax revenue
from the 4B Corporation.

The city estimates that the center would generate $850,000 a year in revenue
after three years. Its forecast for the actual expenditures after the three
years is $825,000. Earlier figures showed that the cost of operations would
run between $850,000 to $900,000.

But City Administrator Nick Finan said that after staff members took a harder
look at the numbers, the city was able to find ways to scale back costs by
hiring contract custodial labor as opposed to paid labor.

If the community center gets a green light from voters, the facility will
have a staff of 12 full-time employees and 18 part-time. Their salaries,
which Finan said are included in the $825,000 operations cost, would total
$375,000 a year.

""If we can meet our expectations, then we expect for our revenues to be more
than our expenditures,"" he said.

But if the city does not meet its expectations, Finan said that city council
will have to decide how to handle the shortfall.

""At that time maybe the operations of the facility will be scaled back,"" he
said. ""There are a myriad of ways that can be addressed.""

After the third year, the city anticipates that the center will have between
1,200 and 1,500 full and partial memberships at an estimated yearly cost of
$450 to $275 for aquatics memberships. Fees alone after the third year are
projected to generate $550,000 in revenue.

The certicates on the community center would last 20 years, said Finan. The
payments on the bond note would be $750,000 a year. The city's current
general fund debt is $28.6 million.

The life of the pool is expected to be 25 years to 30 years because it is
indoors and located in the southern part of the country. Finan said if the
referendum should pass, the city would initiate the first issuance of
certificates this summer.



Spreading the Word

Teresa Toungate and the other members of the League City Barracudas swim team
showcased a banner that urged residents to vote for the proposed community
center during the city's holiday parade in December.

The group will soon begin work on fliers and letters sent to other swim teams
asking them to become vocal supporters of the project.

""The way I see it, we have access to 500 people through the swim teams and if
each one of those people tells a friend and then goes to the polls we'll have
one of the larger turnouts that League City has seen in a long time,"" she
said.

The way people like J.A. Willhern see it, there's a lot more the city needs
to get nailed down before he votes for the project. Shiny brochures and
colorful artist renderings aren't enough.

""You (the city) want us to give you a blank check,"" he said to city officials
at Thursday's first public hearing on the community center.

The city has not set fees for the center. It has only estimated the amount
the center would need to one day be self-sustaining.

That move would have been political, said Mayor Tommy Frankovich.

""We could make it look nice in order to get the issue passed and play around
with numbers just to get it,"" he said. ""That's why we kept the numbers
general.""

Frankovich said that future council would set the fees for the community
center if the referendum passes.

The ballot language for Proposition 1 is simple. It asks only whether
residents would or would not support a community center to be built in the
city.

It says nothing of the cost of the facility and how it would be financed.
There was no legal requirement to do so, said Finan. The referendum also does
not tell voters that the measure is binding.

As vehemently as Toungate is about supporting the project, opponents of the
community center are working to kill the deal. They're asking questions,
requesting information and telling those they come in contact with their
opinions.

""No, I will not support it,"" said League City resident Fred Lawrence. ""Right
now, I don't have enough information and I think the information that the
city is giving us is bad for the vote.""

At the top of his concern list is why the city hasn't decided on where to
build the community center. Two options exist - the 5.4 acres the county
agreed to let the city lease in Walter Hall Park or the Arolfo site on 25
acres of land adjacent to city hall.

Project consultants said geo-technical studies show the Arolfo site would be
better suited for what the city wants to build.

""They don't know what they want but they want the voters to make a decision,""
said Elaine Kosty, a former council member.

Opponents contend the project is a gift to the numerous area swim teams. They
said that if the swim teams want the facility, the city should make them pay
for it.

Conversely, many of the community center supporters say that the swimming
pool was promised to them during the 1994 quarter-cent sales tax election.
Revenue from that sales tax initiative was used to build the Sportsplex.

But Toungate said that the community center dialogue has been narrowed to
focus in on only the swimming pool, a portion of the project that the swim
teams have tried to shy away from.

""We understand that that's an ugly issue,"" she said. ""But the focus should be
on the benefit the community center brings to the entire community.""

The swim teams were told upfront, said Toungate, that they would have to pay
for the first-class facility if they wanted it. She said that her team has 
decided that it would pay what was necessary to be able to use the facility.

""We're not asking for any free rides or for the city to cut us any special
deals,"" she said.

The city estimates that teams will be charged $25 an hour for use of the
facility and that up to three teams can use the 50-meter pool at one time.

Toungate said she understands the concerns of older residents and what impact
the community center might have on some of them.

""I understand that older people are not going to use the pool but by the same
token I'm not going to use the senior citizen room,"" she said.


Winner and Losers

Who will ultimately benefit from the center if it is built is debatable. The
city would have a top-notch facility, the only one in the area with an indoor
pool capable of attracting state and national swim meets. It could also have
the pull to get state and national cheerleading competitions in town,
supporters say.

Economic development would benefit, said Finan.

Toungate and other supporters said such athletic meets attract thousands of
people.

""These people will come to our city and spend their money in our city,"" said
Toungate.

These same people could also cause overflow parking problems in the city,
Lawrence.

Close to 400 parking spaces will be needed to accommodate a building the size
of the proposed community center.

""We don't have the restaurants to feed these thousands of people,"" said
Lawrence. ""They're going to go down to Clear Lake and NASA Road 1.""

If the center is built, the city says that according to financial forecasts,
taxes would not have to be raised to support the facility.

But if the city does not make its goal of getting the 1,200 to 1,500
memberships, the costs of running the facility could continue to come from
the general fund or the operations might have to be scaled down, said Finan.

That bothers Lawrence.

""I just don't like the way the whole thing was set up,"" he said.

Toungate is bothered that the project has been viewed so negatively.

""People love to dwell on the negative,"" she said. ""Look at the whole picture.
This center will benefit every age and resident from little children to
senior citizens. That's something positive for the city.""

"So True!!","
Subject: So True!!


Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, on his way home from work

 at City Hall, came to a dead halt in traffic on the Dan

 Ryan Expressway and thought to himself, ""Wow, this traffic

 seems worse than usual. Nothing's moving at all.""



 He noticed a State Trooper walking back and forth between

 the lines of cars, so he rolled down his window and asked,

 ""Officer, I'm Mayor Richard M. Daley, what's the problem;

 what's holding everything up.""



 The trooper replied, ""It's the Reverend Jackson.  He's so

 depressed about the thought of everyone knowing about his

 extra-martial affair and his illegitimate child, that he

 stopped his car in the middle of the Dan Ryan Expressway

 and is threatening to douse himself with gasoline and set

 himself on fire. He says the country and his congregation

 are blaming him for his infidelity and doesn't know if he

 can live with the shame and embarrassment.  The people in

 the halted cars along the expressway are taking up a

 collection for him.""



 ""Oh really,"" replied Mayor Daley. ""How much have they

 collected for the Reverend Jackson so far?""



 ""About 300 gallons,"" said the trooper, ""but they are still

 siphoning""

Best of the Web Today - January 14, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
'A Significant Political Opportunity'  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40691-2002Jan13.html

Quoted in today's Washington Post, an unnamed ""key Democratic strategist"" has this to say about the Enron fiasco: ""Democrats are very excited about this because this gives us a hook to bring this guy [President Bush] some accountability, plus there's no way it's not going to be a distraction for them. Privately, Democrats are almost unanimous in seeing this as a significant political opportunity. But we don't want to blow it.""

Pardon us for spoiling the party, but there is a war on. It's not the most opportune of times to distract the president with a phony political scandal. Of course it's another matter if investigations turn up evidence of genuine wrongdoing by government officials, but if this strategist is to be believed, Democrats are happy to proceed in the absence of any such evidence.

And what exactly is the Bush administration alleged to have done? Here's Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, on yesterday's "" Meet the Press  http://msnbc.com/news/686453.asp "": ""If there was any, any involvement because of the incredible help the Bush campaign got from Enron here, it will be--I don't know that there has been--but it will be devastating."" But on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut echoed Rep. Henry Waxman, who, as we  noted Friday  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718 , said it was a scandal that the administration refused to give Enron special treatment. Fox doesn't have a transcript on its Web site, so here's a  CNN report  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/01/13/enron/index.html :

*** QUOTE ***

[Treasury Secretary Paul] O'Neill, a guest on ""Fox News Sunday,"" defended the government's decision not to intervene as Enron's stock price collapsed. Lieberman called O'Neill's comments ""outrageous"" and promised an aggressive investigation of Enron's collapse.

*** END QUOTE ***

Before the Democrats start throwing around accusations, shouldn't they at least agree on what would constitute a scandal?

The President and the Pretzel  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A41179-2002Jan14.html

Here's an early nominee for  bottom news story  http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001644#bottom  of 2002: President Bush was watching the Miami-Baltimore playoff game yesterday when, as Press Secretary Ari Fleischer explains, ""he was eating a pretzel, and he said it felt like it did not go down right. He fainted. He woke up what he believes were a few seconds later."" He scraped his cheek when he fell. The White House physician checked him out, and he's fine. The Dolphins, on the other hand, choked, losing to the Ravens 20-3.

Picking Up the Pieces  http://www.observer.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0,1501,631972,00.html

""American special forces searching the Tora Bora cave complex in eastern Afghanistan are collecting dismembered fingers and human organ tissue in an attempt to establish whether Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were killed during last year's massive assault on the caves,"" reports London's Observer. The paper quotes an unnamed ""intelligence source"" as saying: ""Just before the complex fell, I got a call from a friend involved in the operation. He told me: 'We really think we've got him. It's only a matter of time.' All the information we had at that time suggests he must be dead.""

The paper's sources say their ""most likely hypothesis"" is that Osama has met Allah. The  Christian Science Monitor  http://csmonitor.com/2002/0114/p1s2-wosc.html , however, says that Afghan intelligence officials think he's in Pakistan.

How Omar Got Away  http://www.msnbc.com/news/686895.asp

Newsweek interviews Qari Saheb, who served as Mullah Mohammad Omar's personal driver, who explains how the top Talib escaped:

*** QUOTE ***

Saheb was with Omar at his compound in Kandahar last Oct. 7 when the first American bombs began to fall. According to Saheb, Omar initially spurned advisers who begged him to flee to safety. ""Even if Bush shows up at my door, I will not leave,"" said Omar. His advisers told him that the Americans would use chemical weapons. Omar brandished a gas mask, but the aides warned him that the masks were good only for an hour. Knowing that the Americans would target his SUV, aides ushered Omar into a rickshaw. Pulled into the center of town, Omar shifted to a mud-covered truck and disappeared. He spent the next several days moving from house to house, sleeping in basements.

*** END QUOTE ***

Agence France-Presse  http://www.hindustantimes.com/nonfram/140102/dlame31.asp  reports that ""influential Pashtuns,"" including members of the interim Afghan government, are helping Omar evade arrest.

Osama's Unfunniest Home Videos--I  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1758000/1758422.stm

A gun-toting toddler is among the stars of a new al Qaeda video obtained in Afghanistan and aired by the  Australian Broadcasting Corp.  http://abc.net.au/ra/newstories/RANewsStories_457534.htm  The BBC describes the scene:

*** QUOTE ***

One sequence shows a small boy--aged about two--holding a gun. A man's voice asks him in Arabic why he is carrying a gun. Is it to kill infidels, the voice inquires.

*** END QUOTE ***

The video also shows ""fighters storming a building and taking hostages, barking commands at them in English and shooting one captive dead"" and ""an apparent assassination attack on a motorcade.""

Osama's Unfunniest Home Videos--II  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A34200-2002Jan11.html

The Washington Post has details of what we assume was another tape, released by the Singapore government in the wake of the recent terror bust there:

*** QUOTE ***

The tape . . . features a man describing how explosives could be carried on a bicycle without arousing suspicion. The man--identified as Hashim bin Abas, 40, a ""service engineer""--was among 15 suspected Islamic militants taken into custody in Singapore last month. . . .

According to the Singapore ministry [of home affairs], the alleged terrorist cell had two plans ""ready for activation."" One apparently involved blowing up the shuttle bus that carries U.S. military personnel between a naval base used by visiting warships and a train station, a scenario suggested in the videotape, which appears to have been made for reconnaissance purposes.

The tape depicts the station from various angles, then focuses on a bicycle bay located beneath the north end of the station and train tracks. Bicycles are shown with cargo boxes mounted in the back.

*** END QUOTE ***

The  Straits Times  http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/singapore/story/0,1870,95812,00.html  reports that the Muslim Student Society at the National University of Singapore is applauding the arrests. ""It is a very sad state of affairs that even Singapore is not free of the global terror network that is seeding chaos throughout the world,"" Mohamed Nawab Mohamed Osman, the group's head, tells the paper.

Radio Silence  http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/8661.htm

Abdallah Higazy, a 30-year-old Egyptian man, has been charged with perjury in an odd case that could mean nothing--or a great deal. According to authorities, Higazy, a computer-science student at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn, checked into the Millenium [sic] Hilton, a luxury hotel across the street from the World Trade Center, Aug. 27 and said he planned to stay until Sept. 25. Reports the New York Post:

*** QUOTE ***

On Sept. 11, he was in the hotel room and immediately evacuated without his belongings after the attacks. . . . When hotel security eventually began clearing the rooms of personal belongings in October, an employee opened the safe in Higazy's room and found [a] pilot-to-pilot radio, a Koran, and a medallion.

The radio can be used by pilots in the air to communicate with each other or someone on the ground could use it to talk to pilots in flight. It could also be used to monitor pilots' conversations from the ground.

Higazy tried to retrieve his things in December, when FBI agents appeared and asked him about the radio. Although he admitted having some knowledge of communications equipment from being in the Egyptian Air Corps branch of that nation's army, the suspect denied the radio was his and said he'd never seen it before, authorities charge.

The Queen's Flight  http://www.observer.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,6903,631967,00.html

British Police finally got around to raiding his home last week, and found he was gone.

Our Friends the Saudis  http://www.menewsline.com/stories/2002/january/01_14_2.html

The Middle East Newsline reports that ""Saudi Arabia appears to be signalling to Iraq that it is prepared for a reconciliation.""

Make It a Triple  http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=13012002-102158-9032r

UPI reports that ""conviction is growing in diplomatic circles where attention must be paid to such developments that the world is witnessing the emergence of a new Triple Alliance in Eurasia""--between India, Israel and Turkey.  You heard it here first.  http://opinionjournal.com/columnists/tvaradarajan/?id=95001172

To Protect the Guilty  http://headlines.sify.com/476news2.html

Tehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan, an extremist political party banned by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, is changing its name to Millat-e-Jafria Pakistan, Agence France-Presse reports.

'The Taliban Wing'  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64452-2002Jan4.html

A recent Washington Post article describes how Sayed Abdullah was brutalized by the Taliban, who falsely suspected he was Christian because he had two Bibles--one in English and one in the Dari language--in his personal library:

*** QUOTE ***

Several guards came in and forced Sayed face down on the table. They tied his hands and feet to its legs. Then they beat him with sticks and heavy plastic ropes, punching, pounding, whipping. Sayed says he endured two or three hours of it before he passed out. . . .

The Taliban guards again tied him on the table. This time, they poured water on his feet, then wound electrical wires around both of his big toes. The wires were attached to an old Soviet military field telephone. The guards turned the telephone's crank, sending a searing electrical current into Sayed's feet. It went on for more than an hour. He felt as if some powerful force was lifting him high off the table, then slamming him down again, over and over.

*** END QUOTE ***

There's more, but this gives a flavor of Abdullah's five-month ordeal. In Saturday's New York Times (link requires registration), columnist  Bill Keller  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/12KELL.html  blasts Sens. Phil Gramm, Jesse Helms and Strom Thurmond, who, he says, ""have in common the fact that they harnessed their collective century of seniority to the Taliban wing of the American right."" You know, the guys who torture people they suspect of being Christians.

Andrew Sullivan  http://andrewsullivan.com/  has been doing a brilliant job rebutting liberal media folks who pooh-pooh Bernard Goldberg's best-selling book, "" Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News  http://www.bennettandcurran.com/cgi-bin/Shopper.exe?preadd=action&key=0895261901 ."" We particularly like this exchange, which Sullivan found in the Dec. 18 transcript of CNN's ""Newsnight With Aaron Brown"":

*** QUOTE ***

Brown: Some conservatives jumped on [John] Walker, saying he is a product of cultural liberalism--the California kind--helping to turn an impressionable kid against his own country.

Joining us from Salinas, California, one of those conservatives, Shelby Steele of the Hoover Institution. Mr. Steele wrote a provocative article the other day in  The Wall Street Journal  http://opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=95001578 --a column in the Journal.

And here in New York, a columnist who thinks Mr. Steele is making an awfully broad generalization. Richard Cohen of the Washington Post. It's nice to have both of you here. Mr. Steele.

Steele: First of all, let me interrupt you just a minute.

Brown: OK.

Steele: Is Richard Cohen a liberal?

Brown: Yeah, Richard Cohen's a liberal. I think he would say that, wouldn't he? . . .

Cohen: On this issue.

Brown: On this issue. OK. Everyone is now branded, I guess.

Steele: OK. Great.

Brown: Now let me try . . .

Steele: If I'm going to be, everybody is going to be.

*** END QUOTE ***

Of course no one suggests Brown is deliberately being unfair, but this does seem to be an indisputable example of the kind of unthinking bias about which Goldberg writes.

Let It Slide?  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40795-2002Jan13.html

Speaking of the Marin mujahid, the Washington Post has another long profile of him that adds even more details about his liberal upbringing. A few tidbits: When the Lindhs (Walker's father's name) lived in ultraliberal Takoma Park, Md., before moving to Marin County, Calif., Walker's mother became ""something of a local activist. Neighbors recall her waging a zealous campaign to have a metal slide at a local playground removed, saying it was too dangerous for children."" Yemen, apparently, was not too dangerous for children.

In her activism, Walker's mother shamefully exploited her young daughter:

*** QUOTE ***

Marilyn Walker took their 9-year-old daughter, Naomi, to a small local demonstration denouncing U.S. bombing raids over Iraq. The Marin Independent Journal ran a photo of the girl standing amid a few dozen protesters waving signs at passing traffic that read, ""Don't Kill Iraqi Kids.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Our favorite detail from the story, though, is its description of Walker's high school, which ""had a rare teaching philosophy: It held no classes.""

Stupidity Watch  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/12/opinion/L12TERR.html
 
In a letter to the editor of the New York Times (link requires registration), one John E. Colbert of Chicago opines: ""In searching for the next targets, the United States should consider other terrorists closer to home: thousands of deaths occur each year from drunken driving, gun violence and lack of health care--to name just a few culprits that terrorize and kill Americans."" Yeah, John, let's drop a few bombs on lack of health care.

Wobegon in Albany  http://www.timesunion.com/AspStories/story.asp?storyKey=74614

We can't help but admire the cruelty of the Albany (N.Y.) Times Union's editors, who printed a letter from one Charles Heinze that concludes as follows:

*** QUOTE ***

If we are looking for a place to start, let's start with what the average hourly pay is in America and see to it that this is the minimum wage for all full-time employees.

And before you say it can't be done, look at what welfare, and other public assistance including health care and having the thousands of not-for-profits cost us each year.

*** END QUOTE ***

A tip of the hat to whoever wrote the headline: ""All Should Be Paid at Least the Average U.S. Salary."" That ""at least"" is a stroke of genius.

Then and Mao  http://www.portal.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/13/wmao13.xml

London's Daily Telegraph reports on a ""model Chinese village devoted to Maoist ideals"":

*** QUOTE ***

Hoardings urge workers to ""Put Mao Tse-tung thought in command of everything"" and a deafening public address system regularly broadcasts rousing communist anthems. . . . Apartments come in only two sizes. Residents are bound by strict rules. The approval of a Communist Party committee is required for all marriages. A mass wedding is held once a year on New Year's Day. After childbirth women are sterilised. Wrongdoers are paraded through the village with their heads shaved. The village has acquired cult status among those who still pine for the certainties of the Mao era.

*** END QUOTE ***

Alas, it's being razed to make way for a business park designed to attract foreign investors.

The Son Also Sets
Several readers wrote to inquire about our  Friday item  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001718#nimitz  on the curious death notice for Rear Adm. Chester W. Nimitz and his wife. No, this wasn't the Adm. Chester Nimitz who led the Pacific fleet during World War II; he died in 1966. It was his son. You can read the  U.S. Navy  http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq36-4.htm  biography of Nimitz Sr. or visit the  Nimitz Museum  http://www.nimitz-museum.org/nimitz_museum.asp  in Fredericksburg, Texas. And here's the  New York Times obit  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/08/obituaries/08NIMI.html  of Nimitz Jr. (link requires registration). Our Friday item referred not to it but to a paid death notice.

Still Cold in Antarctica  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40974-2002Jan13.html

If you live in Antarctica, you've probably been waiting hopefully for years for ""global warming"" to kick in. Sorry, it's still cold. In fact, if you think it's gotten colder, you're not crazy. ""Scientists working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of east Antarctica have found temperatures dropping at a rate of 1.2 degrees Fahrenheit per decade since 1986, and have observed similar downward trends across the continent since 1978.""

""I'd be very careful with this,"" Michael Oppenheimer, chief scientist for  Environmental Defense  http://environmentaldefense.org/ , tells the Washington Post. ""My general view has been that there's simply not enough data to make a broad statement about all of Antarctica."" But we can make broad statements about the whole world?

Next headline to watch for: ""Homeless Antarcticans Hit Hardest by Cooling Trend.""

A Drink You Can Eat  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nm/20020111/od/brew_dc_2.html

Reuters reports a South Korean brewer has come up with ""chewable liquor""--""a gelatin form of its popular Paeksaejoo rice wine."" This is supposed to be an innovation, but haven't the folks at Reuters heard of  Jell-O shots  http://www.outofthefryingpan.com/recipes/jello.shots.shtml ?

Our Ever-Expanding Rights  http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/49699_judo07.shtml

Last month the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported on one of the silliest lawsuits we've ever heard of. Fourteen-year-old judo champion Leilani Akiyama went to court, claiming that the practice of bowing before a judo match violated her rights:

*** QUOTE ***

Bowing in a private club is one thing, but the practice should not be mandatory in a public facility for a tournament, said Akiyama's attorney, Mark Fleming.

Bowing ""takes away critical thinking,"" said John Holm, Akiyama's stepfather and judo instructor. ""You think you're giving respect, but it's really a submissive act.""

Holm, who teaches 35 students at his judo club in Renton, says the bowing largely stems from customs of Shinto, an ancient religion indigenous to Japan. Shinto is based on custom, reverence for ancestral traditions, and living and acting according to the guidance of the gods.

Akiyama's mother, Mariko, a native of Japan, is Buddhist and doesn't want her children to be forced to practice Shinto rituals, Holm said.

He also said some Muslim and Christian students in his class have the skills and would like to compete in regional and national competitions but will not because it offends their beliefs.

""Bowing is a prayer act, and Muslims can only pray to Allah,"" Holm said. ""It's just unfair.""

*** END QUOTE ***

Judge Robert Lasnik should take a bow; last week, in a show of good sense, he ruled against Akiyama.

ATTITUDE

The 92-year-old, petite, well-poised and proud mother-in-law of my best
friend, who is fully dressed each morning by eight o'clock, with her hair
fashionably coiffed and makeup perfectly applied, even though she is legally

blind, moved to a nursing home today. Her husband of 70 years recently
passed away, making the move necessary.

Maurine Jones is the most lovely, gracious, dignified woman that I have
ever had the pleasure of meeting. While I have never aspired to attain her
depth of wisdom, I do pray that I will learn from her vast experience.

After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home,
she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As she maneuvered her
walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of her tiny room,
including the eyelet sheets that had been hung on her window. ""I love it,""
she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been
presented with a new puppy.

""Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the room ... just wait.""

""That doesn't have anything to do with it,"" she replied.  ""Happiness is
something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not
doesn't depend on how the furniture is arranged ... it's how I arrange my
mind. I already decided to love it ... ""It's a decision I make every morning

when I wake up. I have a choice; I can spend the day in bed recounting the
difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or get out
of bed and be thankful for the ones that do. Each day is a gift, and as long

as my eyes open I'll focus on the new day and all the happy memories I've
stored away ... just for this time in my life. Old age is like a bank
account ... you withdraw from what you've put in ... So, my advice to you
would be to deposit a lot of happiness in the bank account of memories.""

Have a great day!

If more of us had this attitude... just think how much better off this world

would be!

DOWNWARD MARCH

America's Federal Reserve responded to continuing signs of economic
weakness with its eleventh INTEREST-RATE CUT of the year. A reduction
of a quarter-point brings rates down to 1.75%, the lowest for 40 years.

- - - - - See article: Don't bet on a swift recovery
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36738_6723637_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

The value of GLOBAL MERGER AND ACQUISITION ACTIVITY in 2001 was $1.6
trillion, half what it was worth the previous year, according to data
from Dealogic. In 2000, the inflated value of high-tech shares fuelled
many a deal that now looks unwise.

CSFB is to hand over some of the cash it had made from the dotcom boom.
The investment bank has reportedly agreed to pay $100m to settle an
investigation by America's regulators into claims that it had rigged
initial public offerings of high-tech shares by allocating big tranches
to favoured customers in return for a slice of the profits in the form
of inflated commissions.

ZURICH FINANCIAL SERVICES reshuffled its top management yet again.
Dinos Iordanou, who had been promoted to head of group operations last
year and was tipped to take over the top job, left to run an insurance
start-up. Perhaps as a result, Converium, a reinsurance business Zurich
has spun off, made a quiet stockmarket debut.

The weak economy claimed more victims at AMERICAN EXPRESS. It announced
that up to 6,500 more jobs would go, on top of the 7,700 announced in
the past 12 months, a total of 15% of its workforce.

COMPAQ'S merger with HEWLETT-PACKARD seemed doomed after the Packard
foundation rejected the deal. Hewlett family members had already
dismissed the merger; together they own 18% of the company. Compaq
shares sank, but both it and HP optimistically insisted that the deal
would succeed with the aid of institutional shareholders.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36737_6723637_1_79944192_60299072_1_68

TELECOM TROUBLES

The global telecoms slump hit Eastern Europe. TELEKOMUNIKACJA POLSKA
announced that it would get rid of 12,000 employees next year, some 20%
of its workforce. France Telecom, which acquired 35% of the former
state monopoly from the Polish government last year, had said that job
cuts would come but had agreed with powerful unions that it would wait
four years.

Struggling BRITISH TELECOM appointed Ben Verwaayen, a Dutchman from
struggling Lucent Technologies, as its new chief executive, to replace
Sir Peter Bonfield, who recently said he would depart from BT a year
ahead of schedule.

NOKIA provided some relief from the gloom surrounding high-tech
companies. The Finnish mobile-phone behemoth announced that
fourth-quarter profits were likely to be better than previously
forecast after handsets sold in greater quantities than expected. But
fourth-quarter profits will not match last year's; and its
infrastructure business still languishes.

CONSIGNIA, once known as Britain's Post Office, may have to lay off
some 30,000 workers over the next year and a half, twice previous
estimates for redundancies needed to save costs as postal growth slips.
Unions reacted to the state-owned company's announcement with outrage
and threatened to strike.

YAHOO!, the world's biggest Internet portal, made an unsolicited offer
of $436m for HOTJOBS, a careers website that was planning to merge with
its rival, TMP Worldwide.

DRUG CULTURE

Corporate Japan suffered its biggest foreign intrusion with the
purchase by ROCHE of a controlling interest in CHUGAI, a large drug
company, for up to YEN198 billion ($1.59 billion). The Swiss drug firm
assuaged Japanese sensitivities by dressing the deal up as an alliance
with Roche as an invited partner.

PFIZER threatened to stop supplying France with new medicines in
protest at the country's drug-pricing policies. It hopes competitors
will join the struggle to squeeze extra cash from France's government;
it would go to research and developing better cures, says Pfizer.

MERCK shocked investors and sent its shares reeling with the news that
profits would not grow in 2002. The American drug firm blamed the
expiry of patents and slowing sales.

FIXING THE CAR MAKER

FIAT unveiled plans for a restructuring that would see the loss of
6,000 jobs, the sale of non-core assets and the possible demise of up
to 18 of its factories. The head of its car-making division, Roberto
Testore, resigned.

- - - - - See article: Fiat's problems
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36736_6723637_1_79944192_60299072_1_67

Five GERMAN BANKS felt the wrath of the European Commission. In its
latest round of cartel-busting, the commission levied fines of EURO101m
($90.4m) for fixing commissions on the exchange of the 12 euro-area
currencies since 1997. Three banks said they would appeal.

Dear Mary,
       I have some really exciting news to share with you and the residents
of Clear Creek Village, and hope you will include this in your next email.
       The City has been successful in being awarded yet ANOTHER GRANT to
purchase park land in League City.  And this purchase will positively
affect/protect your homeowners.
       Thanks to the tireless efforts, dedication and vision of Rhonda Cyrus,
Superintendent of Parks and Recreation, the City of League City has been
awarded $500,000 from the CIAP (Coastal Impact Assistance Program) to
purchase 51.4 acres from Kenneth Erickson, land that is adjacent to Clear
Creek Village.
       I know you and others will be glad that the land will not be developed
or subdivided.
       Please feel free to contact me with any questions!
Barbara Meeks

>We reget to inform you that, effective immediately, Santa Claus will no
>longer be able to serve the Southern United States on Christmas Eve. Due to
>the overwhelming current population of the earth, his contract was
>renegotiated by North American Fairies and Elves Local 210, and he now
>serves only certain areas of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and
>Michigan.
>
>As part of the new and better contract, Santa will also get longer breaks
>for milk and cookies, so keep that in mind. Your children will not be
>ignored on Christmas Eve - they will be in the good hands of your local
>replacement, Santa's second cousin, Bubba Claus. His side of the family is
>from the South Pole. He shares Santa's goal of delivering toys to all the
>good boys and girls, however, you may notice a few differences in the
>service. For example:
>
>1. There is no danger of a Grinch stealing your presents from Bubba Claus.
>He has a gun rack on his sleigh and a bumper sticker that reads ""These toys
>insured by Smith and Wesson.""
>
>2. Instead of milk and cookies, Bubba Claus prefers that children leave an
>RC cola and pork rinds or a moon pie on the fireplace. And Bubba doesn't
>smoke a pipe, though he dips a little snuff, so please have an empty spit
>can handy.
>
>3. Bubba Claus' sleigh is pulled by floppy-eared flyin' coon dogs instead
>of reindeer. Reindeer were once mistakenly issued to Bubba Claus, who now
>has a couple more nice trophy heads over his fireplace.
>
>4. You won't hear ""On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen ..."" when
>Bubba Claus arrives. Instead, you'll hear, ""On Ernhardt, on Wallace, on
>Martin and Petty....""
>
>5. ""Ho, ho, ho!"" will be replaced by ""Yee-haw!"" And you also are likely to
>hear Bubba's elves respond in unison, ""I hear'd dat!""
>
>6. As required by Southern highway laws, Bubba Claus' sleigh does have a
>Yosemite Sam safety triangle on the back with the words ""Back Off."" He also
>has a few other decorations on his sleigh back as well, such as a string of
>flashing Christmas lights around the license plate, and a caricature of
>Santa Claus going wee-wee on the Tooth Fairy.
>
>7. The usual Christmas movie classics such as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and
>""It's a Wonderful Life"" will not be shown in your negotiated viewing area.
>Instead, you'll see ""Boss Hogg Saves Christmas"" and ""Smokey and the Bandit
>V"" featuring Burt Reynolds as Bubba Claus and dozens of state patrol cars
>crashing into each other.
>
>8. Bubba Claus doesn't wear a belt. You should make sure that the wife and
>the kids turn the other way when he bends over to put presents under the
>tree.
>
>9. And finally, Christmas songs about Santa Claus, such as ""Rudolph The
>Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" will be replaced on
>all AM radio stations in the South by your new official Christmas carol,
>""Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer.""

"Now HERE is a good lawsuit...","A fun-filled bachelor party at a strip club called the Pretty Kitty
turned deadly recently when a 32-year-old groom-to-be who was enjoying
the attentions of a well-endowed stripper suffocated while his face was
buried in her 72-DD breasts. According to investigators, the man was
enjoying a lap dance from a stripper named Kandy Kane when disaster
struck. She began giving him a lap dance, shaking her breasts in his
face. The more she shook, the deeper the man got lost in her cleavage.
Before long, his friends noticed he was no longer moving. The man's
family is suing Miss Kane and the Pretty Kitty for wrongful death.

Best of the Web Today - January 7, 2002
By JAMES TARANTO
The Clinton Legacy  http://www.sunday-times.co.uk/article/0,,9004-2001601261,00.html

""Bill Clinton turned down at least three offers involving foreign governments to help to seize Osama Bin Laden,"" the Sunday Times of London reports (link requires registration). Two of the offers--from the Sudanese government and Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz--have already been reported. The Times adds:

*** QUOTE ***

A third more mysterious offer to help came from the intelligence services of Saudi Arabia, then led by Prince Turki al-Faisal, according to Washington sources. Details of the offer are still unclear although, by one account, Turki offered to help to place a tracking device in the luggage of Bin Laden's mother, who was seeking to make a trip to Afghanistan to see her son. The CIA did not take up the offer.

Richard Shelby, the leading Republican on the Senate intelligence committee, said he was aware of a Saudi offer to help although, under rules protecting classified information, he was unable to discuss the details of any offer. Commenting generally, he said: ""I don't believe that the fight against terrorism was the number one goal of the Clinton administration. I believe there were some lost opportunities.""

*** END QUOTE ***

The Times also reports that ""according to a witness, Clinton told a dinner companion"" shortly after Sept 11 ""that the decision to let Bin Laden go was probably 'the biggest mistake of my presidency.' "" The man does have a capacity for understatement, at least where his own failures are concerned.

A Bush Misstep?  http://news.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/01/07/war07.xml

London's Daily Telegraph reports that ""the limitations of American military strategy in Afghanistan were made plain"" when U.S. officials conceded Osama bin Laden appears to have escaped to Pakistan. By not sending in a large ground force, the Telegraph argues, the U.S. minimized American casualties, ""but the cost has been a failure to round up Taliban and al-Qa'eda leaders.""

Osama's Better Fifth  http://www.nypost.com/news/worldnews/38227.htm

Bin Laden's ""favorite wife""--he has four of them--was ""reportedly captured in Yemen . . ., firming up investigators' suspicions the terror chief may be living there,"" the New York Post reports. Yemeni authorities are holding Amal Ahmed Al-Sadah under house arrest, and the Post suggests their captive is quite captivating: ""Bin Laden is supposedly smitten with his 20-something wife, who has olive skin, high cheekbones, long dark hair and almond eyes.""

Born to Be Wild  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/south_asia/newsid_1743000/1743813.stm

The BBC reports top Talib Mullah Mohammad Omar ""has escaped from his hideout in southern Afghanistan on a motorbike, according to an Afghan official."" Can we look forward to special-forces raids on Kandahar biker bars?

Have You Seen Me?  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/nm/20020107/wl/attack_afghan_usa_boy_dc_1.html

A 14-year-old boy suspected of killing Sgt. First Class Nathan Ross Chapman--the first American soldier killed by ""hostile fire"" in Afghanistan--is on the run. Consequently, Reuters reports, ""Afghan tribal elders postponed Monday a meeting in eastern Khost"" to decide whether to turn him over to American forces. Four other men are also suspected in the shooting.

The Ones That Didn't Get Away  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/htx/nyt/20020105/ts/u_s_captures_a_top_trainer_for_al_qaeda_1.html

Despite the elusiveness of bin Laden and Mullah Omar, not all the evildoers are slipping through America's fingers. Among those being held prisoner, the New York Times notes, are Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, a Libyan who served as ""one of Osama bin Laden's top paramilitary trainers,"" and Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's former ambassador to Islamabad. Both were captured by Pakistan and turned over to U.S. forces.

Terrorist Wannabe   http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020106/us/plane_crash.html

Charles Bishop, 15-year-old Florida boy taking flight lessons, stole a small plane in St. Petersburg and flew it into the Bank of America building in downtown Tampa. Bishop died, but only one office was severely damaged, and no one was injured.

Although Bishop does not appear to have been a bona fide terrorist, police tell the Associated Press they found a suicide note expressing sympathy for Osama bin Laden and support for the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks."" Police chief Bernie Holder observed: ""From his actions we can assume he was a very troubled young man."" Hey, that's some fine detective work.

The  Tampa Tribune  http://www.tampatrib.com/MGA7N2RT5WC.html  reports police are looking into whether Bishop may have been of Arab descent; the paper notes that ""according to public records, the family name was once Bishara."" Ira Stoll's  Smartertimes.com  http://www.smartertimes.com/archive/2002/01/020107.html  notes that an Arab Israeli member of the Knesset, Azri Bishara, was stripped of his parliamentary immunity in November so that he can be prosecuted for incitement against Israel. Glenn Reynolds's  Instapundit.com  http://instapundit.blogspot.com/2002_01_06_instapundit_archive.html#8482907  adds that Bishara ""was also RFK assassin  Sirhan Sirhan  http://www.geocities.com/verisimus101/rfk/sirhan.htm 's middle name."" But what does Reynolds mean, ""was""? Did Sirhan change his name?

'Foot Soldier'   http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/01/06/MN222117.DTL

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that U.S. and British intelligence officials are exploring the possibility that alleged shoe bomber Richard Reid may have been conducting ""a 'trial run' for future, simultaneous attacks against passenger jets to be carried out by supporters of Osama bin Laden."" Winning the Tasteless Pun of the Day Award, the Chronicle says Reid may have been ""a 'foot soldier' sent to check the destructive power of shoe bombs against civilian targets.""

The  Boston Globe  http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/006/nation/Bomb_probe_eyes_Pakistan_links+.shtml , meanwhile, reports that the Reid probe has led investigators to Sheik Mubarik Ali Gilani, ""one of Pakistan's most secretive and controversial spiritual leaders, a man who over the past 15 years has brought more than 100 US citizens, mostly African-Americans, to Pakistan for religious and military training.""

A Day in the Wife of a Terrorist  http://www.msnbc.com/news/682878.asp

Newsweek devotes a cover story to April Ray, ""a suburban Dallas housewife"" whose husband, Wadih El-Hage, is serving a life sentence in connection with the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa:

*** QUOTE ***

Ray says she is struggling to make ends meet, living off donations from the mosque and welfare. Her children miss their father (whom they call ""Bubba""); they cry for no reason and cling to her. But she is defiant. Like many true believers, she won't accept that bin Laden ordered the September 11 attacks. She suspects they were plotted by the CIA or Israeli intelligence. She is opposed to killing civilians, but if the jihad against the enemies and corrupters of Islam goes on, and her 15-year-old son . . . wants to fight, then she'd consider letting him join when he comes of age. She says she puts her faith in the will of Allah. ""As Muslims, we accept death,"" she says. ""We know it's part of life."" But just in case, she says she wants to buy a gun.

*** END QUOTE ***

About bin Laden, Ray says: ""He was a great boss. He's not the monster people make him out to be.""

Arafat's Arms--II  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020107/ts/israel_palestinians_2516.html

""The Palestinian captain of a ship seized by Israel with 50 tons of offensive weapons on board said in jailhouse interviews Monday that the shipment was intended for the Palestinians and that he got his smuggling instructions from a Palestinian Authority official,"" the Associated Press reports. The Jerusalem Post reports that  Egyptians  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/07/News/News.41234.html ,  Jordanians  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/07/LatestNews/LatestNews.41266.html  and  Palestinians  http://www.jpost.com/Editions/2002/01/07/News/News.41235.html  have all expressed dismay about the smuggling operation.

A Principal of Principle  http://slate.msn.com/?id=2060439

Slate's Timothy Noah notes that the Associated Press has issued a correction of a weeks-old dispatch--which we noted way back on  Dec. 13  http://opinionjournal.com/best/?id=95001592#hottub --that wrongly reported Marcie Miller, principal of Marin mujahid John Walker's high school, said she was proud of Walker. Noah quotes from the correction:

*** QUOTE ***

""The only thing Miller initially had to say about Lindh--who attended Tamiscal [High School] for a year and a half before taking an equivalency exam and leaving at the age of 16--was that teachers had called him 'a gifted writer of poetry.'

"" 'I never met John, so I never would have said that I am proud of him,' she said.

""In fact, Lindh's decision to volunteer for Osama bin Laden's cause is 'opposed to everything I've devoted my life to,' Miller said. 'My brother is a Gulf War hero, I come from an extremely patriotic family, my father's a veteran and I find this appalling, that I'm being cast as a villain who's proud of anything John Walker Lindh has done since he left our school in January of 1998.' . . . Miller said the last time she made headlines was when she brought a junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program into another alternative school, and was 'criticized for being an arch-conservative.' ""

*** END QUOTE ***

The guys at  Salon  http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2002/01/04/ap_correction/index_np.html?x  actually had this story before Noah did, but they didn't make the article available to their approximately six billion nonsubscribers. Guess they didn't want to embarrass the AP.

Stupidity Watch  http://www.upc-online.org/011226vegan_voice_singer.html

Is there intelligent life in solar system Vega? Apparently not, to judge by this letter to the Vegan Voice by one Karen Davis, president of something called United Poultry Concerns:

*** QUOTE ***

While I would not dream of using arguments to diminish the horror of the September 11 attack for thousands of people, I would also suggest that the people who died in the attack did not suffer more terrible deaths than animals in slaughterhouses suffer every day. Moreover, the survivors of the September 11 attack and their loved ones have an array of consolations--patriotism, the satisfaction of U.S. retaliation, religious faith, TV ads calling them heroes, etc--that the chickens, whose lives are continuously painful and miserable, including being condemned to live in human-imposed circumstances that are inimical and alien to them as chickens, do not have available. They suffer raw, without the palliatives. Doubtless the majority, if not every single one, of the people who suffered and/or died as a result of the September 11 attack ate, and if they are now alive continue to eat, chickens. . . .

In conclusion, I think it is speciesist to think that the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center was a greater tragedy than what millions of chickens endured that day and what they endure every day because they cannot defend themselves against the concerted human appetites arrayed against them.

*** END QUOTE ***

Somehow after reading this, we've got a hankering for some McNuggets.

The Straight Dope?  http://slate.msn.com/?id=2060408

Remember when President Bush was dumb? Until Sept. 11 it was the most tiresome cliche going, but since then, in light of his excellent performance as a war leader, we've heard it from only the sourest of America-haters. Until now. Slate's Jacob Weisberg has made a manful effort to revive the Bush-is-stupid cliche and reconcile it with the president's outstanding performance. In brief, Weisberg concocts an argument that Bush is a great wartime leader because he's not the sharpest knife in the drawer. ""In wartime,"" he writes, ""certain qualities sometimes associated with high intelligence--fascination with detail, a tendency to self-reliance, an awareness of ambiguity--become greater obstacles to effective leadership.""

Suffice it to say that we find this argument rather labored--so much so, in fact, that we couldn't help wondering if Weisberg has ulterior motives for putting it forward. As it happens, Weisberg has a direct financial interest in perpetuating the idea that Bush is a buffoon. He's the ""editor"" of two books of ""Bushisms,"" and we'd venture to guess his royalty checks got mighty slim starting in September. (The second book, ""More George W. Bushisms,"" was published on Christmas Day--just two weeks ago--and ranks a pathetic 54,797th in the  Amazon.com  http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743225198/qid=1010429038/sr=8-2/ref=sr_8_67_2/002-8880124-6632852  sales rankings.)

Another possibility: Working for Slate, Weisberg has firsthand experience with the leadership of an ostentatiously brainy man. Could the subtext of this article be a criticism of Mike Kinsley?

'Not Over My Dead Body'  http://www.reuters.com/news_article.jhtml?type=topnews&StoryID=494344

Hey Jake, here's another ""Bushism"" for you: ""Not over my dead body will they raise your taxes,"" he said in a Saturday speech. What does this mean? Is it the opposite of ""over my dead body will they raise your taxes""--i.e., they will raise your taxes? Or does the ""not"" mean his opposition to higher taxes is even more emphatic--i.e., even if they kill me trying, they won't raise your taxes?

The answer, of course, is that it's a Zen koan, like ""What is the sound of one hand clapping?"" Those of us who have attained enlightenment know exactly what President Bush means.

Great Moments in Non-Western Civilization  http://dailynews.yahoo.com/h/ap/20020101/wl/saudi_beheadings_1.html

Saudi Arabia has publicly beheaded three men for ""for committing acts of sodomy and 'seducing young men,' "" the Associated Press reports. Meanwhile, the  New York Times  http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/05/national/05SAUD.html  (link requires registration) reports the Justice Department is looking into whether Princess Buniah al-Saud, arrested in Florida last month on charges of beating her maid, ""held the live-in Indonesian maid in conditions of involuntary servitude.""

And in case you think we're picking on Arabs,  Reuters  http://sg.news.yahoo.com/reuters/asia-82056.html  reports a Chinese court has indicted Li Guangqiang on charges that could carry the death penalty. Li is charged with using ""an evil cult to damage a law-based society""--specifically, with smuggling Bibles into China.

You Don't Say  http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1741000/1741336.stm
 
Between April and November 2001, the BBC reports, ""the number of murders in the [London] Metropolitan Police area committed with a firearm soared by almost 90% over the same period a year earlier""--notwithstanding Britain's 1996 ban on handguns. Observes the BBC: ""Although all privately-owned handguns in Britain are now officially illegal, the tightened rules seem to have had little impact in the criminal underworld.""

Geek Alert  http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=starwars05&date=20020105

On New Year's Day, the Seattle Times reports, 32-year-old John Guth and 24-year-old Jeff Tweiten were the first in line at the Cinerama theater to see "" Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones  http://starwars.com/episode-ii/ ,"" the sequel to the prequel to the 1977 classic ""Star Wars."" Just one problem: ""Episode II"" doesn't open until May 16, and no one knows yet if it's even going to be playing at the Cinerama. Nonetheless, the pair plan to wait in line for 135 days.

What a tragic waste. One hundred thirty-five days is almost enough time to get a life.

"Why the pessimists are wrong again...","Dear Investor,

So far, so good.

My early-October projection of Dow 10,000 by
Thanksgiving came true a few days early.  Now I expect
the market to zigzag its way somewhat higher over the
course of the next two years.

But please, don't go out and ""buy the market.""  Index
funds and the like may make you richer...but they won't
make you truly RICH.  That's because the gap between
winners and losers will be quite large -- in some
cases HUGE -- in the reawakening ahead.

YOU SEE, in some ways the economic and market
pessimists are RIGHT.  Things are different this time
around.  And it's unwise to expect a rising tide that
lifts all boats.  But the right stocks will pay you
handsomely if you buy them now.

The pessimists may rail about Japan's debt load, the
mess in Argentina and Enron's collapse.  But frankly,
my friend, the sky is not all gray.  We're actually
beginning to see some upward earnings revisions.  And
a handful of stocks we own -- like Cendant, SEI
Investments and Harrah's Entertainment -- are already
UP 40%-to-50% from September's lows.  More will
follow.

As you'll discover, the pessimists are WRONG about the
most important issue: We're not headed for some
deflationary death grip or worldwide economic disaster
-- despite the evidence they cite.  Rather we are in
the midst of economic change -- marked by harsh
competition, rapid innovation and hand wringing --
that is a STOCK PICKER'S DREAM.

And in just a moment, I'll share my finely-honed
strategy for market-beating gains -- one that could
easily make you 50% RICHER by the end of the year.

SO PLEASE excuse me if I don't buy all the doom and
gloom.

I respect the intelligence and opinions of the
pessimists.  But for more than 20 years, I've chosen
to go my own way...discover the facts on my own...and
stand up for what I see.

In fact, I visited 18 countries on five continents
last year.  I live part of the year in Europe; just
visited Argentina to size up that situation for
myself; and regularly spend weeks at a time in Greater
China.  Why?  Because like it or not, we truly live in
a global economy.  And by understanding how it works,
I help my clients SAFELY GROW RICH.

HOW?  A time-tested strategy that identifies hot
growth prospects, when the risk of owning them is near
-- or at -- its lowest point.  That's why the
companies I choose span a host of industries, but they
all have four things in common:

1. Financials that show a company solidly in an upward
trend;
2. Management with a laser-like focus on improving the
bottom line;
3. Distinct competitive advantages within its market
niche;
4. And a stock price selling at the low end of its
usual trading range.

THAT'S THE ONLY WAY to invest for low-risk, fortune-
building gains.  And once you join me, I know you'll
agree.

I've just put the finishing touches on my annual list
of ""PROFIT ROCKETS"" for my Investor's World clients
and thought you might want a peek, as well.

In fact, you can get it IMMEDIATELY with a few simple
mouse-clicks -- and 100% RISK-FREE, as well.  Since I
first issued this annual forecast back in 1995, my
clients have really cleaned up -- shouldn't you make a
pile of money this year, too?

From the beginning of 1995 through the end of 2001,
this annual portfolio of ""Profit Rockets"" has racked
up a cumulative gain of 287.5%!  That's over a seven-
year period.  Do the division yourself and see how it
looks.  NOT BAD!  And that time period includes the
worst bear market of the last 25 years -- we were
actually UP another 14% in 2001.

Today, I provide this portfolio solely to my
Investor's World clients.  But I first started making
this ""annual forecast"" in 1995 as a regular panelist
on Wall $treet Week With Louis Rukeyser.

IN 1995, I was #1 among over 20 world-class investors
with gains of 63.3% -- as audited by Bloomberg.  In
1996, I ""slipped"" to #2.  And in 1999, I just missed
out on top honors with a NICE FAT 60.4% GAIN.

And frankly, I've been helping investors like you to
oversized gains for more than twenty years now.

When the pessimists cried that oil was going to $100 a
barrel in the 1980s, I led my clients to the rational
truth and more big profits.  After the crash of 1987,
I debated every pessimist I could find.  And back in
1993 -- with stocks in the dumps and the pessimists
having a field day -- I told clients to buy for the
greatest bull market in history.

I was right each time.  And I'm staking my reputation
-- and my own money -- on the well-considered belief
that I'm right again.

So please, I urge you, try my Investor's World
advisory RISK-FREE.  As soon as you sign up, you'll
get my full list of 10 Profit Rockets for 2002
immediately, online.  Just click here now:

new ""Top 10"" list doesn't pique your interest -- or if
you're dissatisfied with my service for any reason --

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Don,  President Bush delivers his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, and on Wednesday our Washington bureau will bring us complete coverage of the speech as it relates to energy.  During his address, the President will likely discuss the pending debate in the U.S. Senate over comprehensive energy legislation.  President Bush is not expected to mention Enron by name, but he's expected to touch on some of the issues raised by the company's bankruptcy.   There's a regular Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting on Wednesday.  There are a host of issues on the agenda including the Commission's new push to address market power and the California case.   Finally from Washington, in the wake of the Enron implosion, there's talk of a new lobbying effort on behalf of electricity restructuring.  Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker is spearheading the effort and will talk with us during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow about where those efforts stand.   Altira Managing Partner Dirk McDermott talks about challenges new energy companies face when trying to find investors, especially since the Enron crisis.  On Wednesday in the Houston bureau, we'll hear from McDermott and have details on his speech from Energy Venture Fair II, where he addressed the issue.   Also from Houston, AES New Energy President Clem Palevich talks about the challenges his company faces in the new Texas electric deregulated market in Texas.     Bonneville Power Administration Spokesperson Mike Hansen will join West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast on Wednesday.   Hansen will discuss how lower market prices will lead to higher rates in the Northwest.      More on energy prices - from New York on Wednesday, Merrill Lynch Senior Economist Gerald Cohen will discuss the impact of energy prices on the economy.  He'll also give us his expectations for the Fed.  Catch Cohen during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast tomorrow.    Closing Prices for Tuesday, Jan. 29, 2002    Crude: $19.58/bbl -$0.47   Unleaded: $0.5669/gallon -$0.0142   Heating Oil: $0.5205/gallon -$0.0108   Gas: $2.006/mmBtu +$0.098   Fwd uE(Feb.): $3.39/mmBtu +$0.03   Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to reschedule or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.     Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Bus Pass and Parking Information","
FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.

Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

"Insights For You From InvestorPlace.com","
  InvestorPlace.com Insights    [IMAGE]Special Investing Bulletin From InvestorPlace.com Advisor Michael Murphy Editor, Technology Investing   December 14, 2001  Buy This Stock Now?And Reap BIG Profits From the Biggest Lie in Technology Today      Microsoft's new operating system, Windows XP, was released in November and is currently selling at record-breaking retail levels. Funny thing is, no one's talking about the most exciting aspect of this system?or the money it can make savvy investors who understand where to invest. That's what I want to tell you about today.   You see, Windows XP transforms the Internet into a poor-man's version of the virtual private network. The promise has actually    A word from our sponsor  Low-Cost Term Life Insurance...and no hassles!   We've been serving the needs of smart investors for the past 114 years. Click here , and in less than 5 minutes you'll have a FREE, custom quote from Ameritas Direct, a division of top-rated Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. For some of the LOWEST term rates available, please check us out TODAY.     been out there for quite some time. But frankly, the operating system couldn't handle all the complexities of doing Internet videoconferences.   Well, now it finally can. All it takes is a $100 camera?a couple of speakers?and a phone line. You can share a spreadsheet, a white board, any sort of collaborative notes-and hold a productive, real-time meeting without ever leaving your desk. It's PERFECT for the home office. A fantastic face-to-face sales tool. Heck, we're installing the cameras all over the place at my offices for immediate feedback-something that's of critical importance in the money management world.   In short, the point I'm trying to make is that video Internet meetings finally really work-for the first time-thanks to Microsoft XP. And I know from experience, there's a huge PENT-UP DEMAND. What's more, the recent terrorist events will only increase the desire for virtual face-to-face meetings, instead of actual travel.  Now Let Me Show You What All That Demand Does to Capacity...and How You Can Profit From This Trend   Let's say you have a group of five people that e-mail back and forth regularly. But now they have the opportunity for a half-hour Internet meeting. That single video face-to-face eats the same equivalent bandwidth of one year's worth of their e-mails!  Now let's say they love the experience-and they will. Pretty soon they're meeting regularly. They all hook up a system at home to     A word from our sponsor  Free Investment Seminar...  Join InvestorPlace.com editors & other top Wall Street advisors at The 24th Annual Florida Money Show. Admission is FREE.... For details click here , or call 800/970-4355. Mention priority #001071.       chat with friends across the country. After all, it really is the next best thing to being there?and it's DIRT-CHEAP-airtime is free-as well.   What industry-which company-will benefit most from this soaring demand? To answer that question, I need to tell you about one of the biggest secrets in technology today. Call it a misconception, if you will.   I call it a bald-faced lie-one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportunity of immense proportions. I'm talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic cable.  As I've been telling my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers, I believe the build-out has really just begun. In fact, I can prove it. And companies that make the fiber are tremendous long-term investments.  But right now, I want to fill you in on just one aspect of the fiber business that will make you quite rich, a whole lot quicker.  Here's the deal. Yes, there is a large amount of unutilized fiber optic cable out there today. But that's not a problem for the tech industry. It's an opportunity.   You see, 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""-that is, it's not activated. At a recent investment conference, I explained it like this: ""You know what dark fiber has in common with a bushel of wheat? You can't send data over either one of them.""  Before this fiber can be used, it has to be ""lit."" Who do you call to do the job? You call Nortel, you call Cisco, you call Lucent. Then they all call ONE COMPANY to get the parts. THAT'S the stock I want you to buy now.  Low Risk With Ten-Bagger Potential  I'm looking at a double-possibly a triple-by this time next year!   And I fully expect to multiply our money ten-times over by 2007. Best of all, this stock is so beaten-down, there's little risk from here. Point is, if I'm right-and I'll gladly stake my reputation on this call-just a small investment now can make you a huge pile of cash. The stock? None other than optical powerhouse JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ: JDSU).  Here's my reasoning:  When the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down-very noticeably slowed down. What does that mean? There isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand.  I believe people in government are very worried about this problem. After all, this is the second time it's happened. Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days because an optical cable got caught in the snare.  That means our communications systems-and therefore our economy-are very, very vulnerable.  Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered. But today, commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems. Virtually nothing moves without it. That's how banks and brokerages transfer funds?how dispatchers route fleets of trucks?how many Americans get paid through direct deposit.  And we are closer to the breaking point than 99.9% of Americans even begin to understand. Here's one example:  Qwest-one of America's biggest carriers-recently said they're 63% loaded on their network. That doesn't sound too bad?until you understand how these networks operate. You can't load a network much past 65%. In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic-because the network spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually sending packets of information.  The system locks. Communications stops. The nation comes to a standstill. Quite simply, America is falling behind the rest of the developed world, and we've got to catch up fast!  Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia, Europe and even South America. That's because we push out more data than everyone else-but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.  Get this-data traffic is DOUBLING every year now. That means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to keep up. That's why the fiber must-and will-be lit. Otherwise business, the economy and our national security are all in the crapper.  So how does a smart investor profit? As I mentioned, the Big 3 systems manufacturers (Nortel, Cisco and Lucent) handle the contracts. But they're all in tough competition with one another. I prefer JDSU, which gives these guys the TOOLS they need to do the job.  There's very little credible competition at that end. If you want reliability, great service and appealing cost structures, it's the ONLY place to turn.  At the height of the boom, JDS Uniphase's stock was nearly 20-times higher. What changed? Spending on communications networks dried up. Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore-it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why I'm so sure of the immense opportunity ahead if you invest in JDSU today. What's more (here's the best part!) this is NOT the only fiber optic play I'm recommending my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers load up on now.

"The MOST-HATED stock in America...","Dear Investor,

Coming out of the stock market crash, nearly every
investor has a story about ""the stock I've learned to
hate.""

For some folks, names like Amazon.com and Yahoo make
their BLOOD BOIL.  Others cringe at the mention of
former industry leaders like Lucent Technology.  Still
more wonder what the heck's wrong with Disney or
Charles Schwab.

But there's one company, in particular, that leaves
investors wondering, ""WHAT WENT WRONG?""

Not because that company plunged into bankruptcy or
pulled a fast one like Enron.  But simply because this
name seemed so full of promise...that investors were
shocked, saddened and hurt when it fell.

AND THAT'S THE STOCK I'm writing to you about -- and
urging you to buy -- today.

It's one I never owned up until now.  In fact, you
might say it's a stock I used to hate.  But now --
when many investors have jumped this ship -- I'm
telling my Technology Investing clients to ""BUY"" with
both hands.  And I'm projecting MONEY-DOUBLING gains
in the next 12 months -- plus a great shot at truly
wealth-building profits over the next several years.

In just a moment, you'll learn how to get the name of
my newest investment -- plus all the details on my
other top holdings -- absolutely RISK-FREE.

BUT FIRST, let me share the highlights of this
intriguing story with you now.

This wireless whippersnapper was the poster-child of
the ""run tech stocks to the moon"" crowd.  The company
-- and everyone associated with it -- touted its new
communications technology as the most significant
breakthrough since man first learned to talk.

No wonder the stock took off like a rocket.  Starting
in January 1999, Wall Street's ""tech touts"" ran it all
the way to $200 on the strength of their glowing
reviews.  In fact, they told investors that the best
was yet to come -- so every time the stock dipped,
people didn't sell, they just bought more!

WHAT A MISTAKE.  I just shook my head at the nonsense
and stayed the heck away.  You see, I couldn't see any
more basis for that mania than for buying ""who-cares-
about-profits"" Amazon.com.  While the dream of its new
technology sounded great...the reality was a totally
different thing indeed.

Simply put, these guys talked a good game, but their
products DIDN'T WORK!

I had a friend, who learned this the hard way.  She
won a few cellular licenses at auction about five
years ago and chose this company as a supplier --
against my heartfelt advice.  So she went to their
plant for a demonstration and NOTHING WORKED.  They
claimed they were going to revolutionize the whole
communications industry, and she couldn't even make a
simple phone call!

And trust me, she wasn't the only one FOOLED.  Both
Lucent and Motorola committed to supporting this
technology as the new industry standard.  And they got
HURT BAD when the whole thing unraveled.

Of course, no one got hurt as bad as unsuspecting
investors, who saw the value of their holdings SLASHED
SOME 80%!  So you can't blame those folks if they hate
this stock and say, ""Never, never again!""

BUT THAT'S A CRYING SHAME.  Because this company's
engineers have been working very, very hard behind-
the-scenes.  And guess what!  Now the technology DOES
WORK.  It's ""knock-your-socks-off stuff"" -- just a few
years later than promised.

And it's going to make my Technology Investing clients
-- you, too, I hope -- a pile of money just ahead.

It's funny, really.  Telecom companies committed to
this communications standard when they never should
have.  But once they did, they signed on for the long
haul.  And now this company--which I'm finally buying
-- will reap the rewards.

AND WE'LL PROFIT with them.

Up to very recently, two competing technologies -- GSM
and CDMA -- were still in the running for wireless
supremacy across the globe.  They were battling to
become the standard for next generation cell phones --
featuring Internet access, email, instant messaging
and other broadband applications.

But now the battle is over.  This company's CDMA
technology -- now that it finally works as promised --
has won out.  And not only is their technology used in
many phones today -- it will be used in ALL future
phones, going forward.

The fun for investors starts now -- and lasts for many
years to come.  Soon the day will come when this
company is paid a royalty on every cell phone sold.
THAT'S HUGE.

Near term, I'm looking to DOUBLE OUR MONEY in the next
12 months.  Longer term, I hate to put a ceiling on
how high this stock could go.  That would be like
having put a limit on Microsoft, Dell or Intel in the
early days -- you're almost sure to miss on the low
side.

DON'T MISS OUT.  Get this company's name --
immediately online -- by accepting a 100% RISK-FREE
trial subscription to my Technology Investing
advisory.  Of course, you'll also get immediate access
to our Web site where you can read current and past
issues of my monthly newsletter.  And I'll send you
introductory reports, especially for new clients, as
well.

Once you join, take a full six months to measure the
value of my advice for yourself.  Don't like what you
see...don't make the profits you want, just cancel, and
your subscription DOESN'T COST YOU A DIME.   That's
reason enough to give it a try.  Because if I'm right
--and I'm staking my reputation and my own money on
this call -- you can double your money, at least, in
2002...and make a small fortune over the next two years.

So please, give yourself a chance.  At least take a
look at Technology Investing to see what you think.
Our unusual six-month guarantee of total satisfaction
means my advisory costs you nothing if you don't 100%
approve.

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
Technology Investing

P.S.  Next time this stock hits $200 a share, it will
be base on merit -- not hype and wishful thinking.
That's a 300% MOVE from here -- a nice profit binge
that I'd hate to see you miss.  My target is a double
in twelve months, then it's onwards and upwards from
there.

Most investors who owned this stock before will miss
out.  They bought way too early on bad advice.  But
not my Technology Investing clients.  Now the
technology -- and the opportunity -- are both very,
very real.  CLICK HERE to join us for the delightful
profits straight ahead:

Hey,

After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.

If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.

If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.

I talked with Peggy this morning. We want to get all the facts and

spread. We want to encourage all residents to express their feelings, but we
need good facts. It is our intent to get all the facts and try to make this a
positive thing for our residents.

The city has always been very good about working with us and we appreciate it.

"Williams Energy News Live -- today's video newscast","
 	 	    Dear Don,  The Department of Energy is hosting a conference on Clean Coal Technology on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a look at where coal-fired generation could be headed in the future.  U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick, the Chairman and CEO of Pepco, is among those scheduled to speak.   Look for energy legislation to move to the forefront when lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break.  Republicans in the Senate say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington bureau will bring us an update on where legislation stands and what the chances are that we'll see a comprehensive energy bill before the end of the year.   The North American Electric Reliability Council will release its 2001/2002 Winter Assessment on Tuesday; our Washington bureau will bring us coverage.   If MTBE is banned, the gasoline industry will have to drastically increase production of ethanol.  On Monday, the Houston bureau's  Gale Smith will have a report on some companies looking at alternative ways of making ethanol.  We'll find out which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.   A recent poll taken by Deloitte & Touche says power deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for consumers.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte & Touche's Branko Terzic on Monday.   ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the California Power Authority is meeting over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its Energy Resource Investment Plan.  The plan is due to the legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.   Also on Monday, the California Energy Commission will hear a petition for reconsideration of its decision on Calpine's proposed Metcalf Energy Center.  After the meeting we'll have comments from the counsel to the petitioners Stephan Volker.    Jolen Operating Company President David Fleischaker will speak with us from Oklahoma City on Monday.  He'll give us a status check of energy legislation and discuss what he feels is the real problem behind Enron.  We'll hear from Fleischaker during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast.   From Dallas on Monday, RBC Capital Markets Director  Mark Easterbrook is joining us.  Easterbrook will talk about the performance and outlook for Master Limited Partnerships in the energy industry and which investors are suited to buy MLPs.  Catch him during the 3:00 p.m. ET newscast.   Broadcasting Note: I just want to give you a heads up on the schedule for next week.  ENL will be dark on Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgiving market holiday.     Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a wonderful and relaxing weekend!   Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

""Oldy but Goody""
 
 
A Christmas  Tale
One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready  for his annual trip... but there were problems everywhere.
Four of his  elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the  regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind  schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mom was coming to  visit.
This stressed Santa even more. Then when he went to harness the  Reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the  fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress.
Then when he began  to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground,  and scattered the toys.
So, frustrated, Santa went back into the house  for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey.  When he went to the cupboard,  he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to  drink.
In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it  broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor.
He went  to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just  then, the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door  and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas Tree.
The angel  said, very cheerfully, ""Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I  have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like  me to stick it?""
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of  the Christmas tree.

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.

NO SURRENDER, YET

Al-Qaeda fighters holed up in the Tora Bora area of AFGHANISTAN showed
no sign of surrender, despite punishing American bombing. A new deal
was offered to al-Qaeda diehards: surrender Osama bin Laden and his
close comrades and go free. Some thought Mr bin Laden had fled to
Pakistan.

- - - - - See article: How to keep the peace in Afghanistan
http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36746_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6d

France said it was ready to commit troops to a multinational
PEACEKEEPING FORCE in Afghanistan. Britain was set to lead it, although
Tony Blair, Britain's prime minister, said that many details still had
to be resolved.

A Somali militia leader alleged that the al-Qaeda terrorist network was
moving its operations to SOMALIA, a mostly Muslim country in a state of
chaos. American officials said that they were investigating, but played
down the possibility that military strikes were imminent.

John Ashcroft, America's attorney-general, charged a Moroccan-born
Frenchman with conspiring with al-Qaeda to carry out the SEPTEMBER 11TH
TERRORIST ATTACKS. Zacarias Moussaoui, who had undertaken pilot
training in Minnesota, could face trial by a secret military tribunal.

VIOLENCE IN THE MIDDLE EAST

Israel ended all direct contact with YASSER ARAFAT and struck at
Palestinian police stations and other targets after ten Israelis in a
bus had been killed by gunmen near a Jewish settlement in the West
Bank. A Fatah militia group and Hamas both claimed responsibility for
the attack, saying that it was in revenge for recent killings of
Palestinians by Israel's forces. Mr Arafat moved to close down all
Hamas and Islamic Jihad offices.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36745_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6c

SAUDI ARABIA'S interior minister, Prince Nayef, announced that for the
first time identity cards, carrying photographs of their unveiled
faces, would be issued to Saudi women under certain conditions.
Hitherto, a woman has been named only as a dependant on the card of her
father or husband.

Ruud Lubbers, the UN high commissioner for REFUGEES, accused
governments of basing their policies towards the world's 22m refugees
on ""fear and mistrust"".

Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, announced that a long-awaited
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION will be held in March.

YESTERDAY'S TREATY

President George Bush said he would give Russia notice that America
will withdraw from the 1972 ANTI-BALLISTIC MISSILE TREATY. Mr Bush said
the treaty was written in a ""different era for a different enemy"".

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36744_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6b

A presidential commission unanimously backed three recommendations that
would allow young workers to invest part of their SOCIAL SECURITY
contributions in the stockmarket. The decision came as concerns grew
over financing the retirement years of the baby-boom generation. The
chances of action seem slim.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36743_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6a

Police in Los Angeles arrested two leaders of the JEWISH DEFENCE LEAGUE
on charges of trying to blow up a mosque and the office of an
Arab-American congressman.

ITALY RETREATS

Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, gave way to his EU partners
and accepted plans for an EU-WIDE ARREST WARRANT. Italy had objected to
the long list of crimes it would cover. Changes in the Italian
constitution will be needed. Mr Berlusconi's Northern League allies
were dismayed, both by the warrant itself (too much foreign meddling)
and by his readiness to yield to EU pressure.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36742_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_69

In advance of an EU SUMMIT at Laeken, in Belgium, the president of the
European Commission, Romano Prodi, attacked members for agreeing to
plans but then not carrying them out (eg, the proposed ""Galileo""
European global-positioning system). EU summits might become mere
high-level talking-shops, he suggested. Become? jeered cynics.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36747_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6e

In BRITAIN, dispute arose over urgings by David Blunkett, the home
secretary, that immigrants should do more to adapt to British ways, and
over a report on some race riots earlier this year, which lamented that
brown and white communities live almost entirely apart. He proposed
more emphasis on the use of English, and a new oath of allegiance for
people seeking naturalisation.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36750_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_68

An international tribunal in The Hague indicted SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC for
genocide during the early-1990s civil war in Bosnia. The former
Yugoslav dictator refused to plead, calling the charge a ""monstrous
absurdity"".

Fourteen British and Dutch plane-spotters who had been held in prison
in GREECE on charges of spying were offered bail.

KILLING IN INDIA

Five gunmen broke into INDIA'S parliament buildings. In the ensuing
battle, they and at least six other people including policemen, though
no MPs, were killed.

- - - - - See article: An attack on India's parliamenthttp://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36749_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_70

One week after a new government was elected in SRI LANKA, bringing the
prospect of peace talks with the separatist Tamil Tigers, the rebels
attacked a police station and an army post killing ten people. Six
Tigers were reported to have been killed.

Nine hereditary rulers of MALAYSIA chose Syed Sirajuddin, the ruler of
Perlis state, as the country's new king for the traditional term of
five years.

Tung Chee-hwa, picked by China to run the former British colony of HONG
KONG, is to run for a second five-year term.

Jiang Zemin became the first Chinese head of state to visit MYANMAR
since the military junta seized power in 1988. China supplies Myanmar
with most of its arms.

CHEESED OFF WITH CHAVEZ

VENEZUELA came to a standstill in a one-day stoppage organised by
private business and backed by labour in protest at decrees issued by
President Hugo Chavez. The president threatened to ""turn the screws"" on
the opposition.

http://TheEconomist.s.maildart.net/link_36748_6723759_1_79944192_60299072_1_6f

ARGENTINA limped on. Domingo Cavallo, the economy minister, said he
would keep his promise to the IMF of a balanced budget next year by
scrapping earlier tax cuts.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO'S second general election in a year failed to break
a political deadlock. The government and opposition each won 18 seats.
The rival leaders held talks on a possible coalition.

"","Hey Deskmates,

Before I toodle off to Denver and my bones grace a few ski slopes I figured I would tell you guys what Eric Serio told me when I was doing the first MDEA nightly checkout thingie. 

I was given to understand that the whole idea behind these EES nitely checkouts for MDEA was that the Services application as well as OATI/scheduling/Daily checkout to agree. However after a couple of conversations with Mike we both reached the inescapable conclusion that not all of us are on the same page as far as MDEA checkouts go. This I hope will help rid of that problem.

My understanding is as follows: 
1. OATI's 'Actual MW' and Services 'Actual Net Tie' have to agree. 
2. OATI's 'Inadvertent' row under daily checkout and Services' ""Imbalance' especially have to agree.
3. The above 2 would automatically agree if OATI is functioning properly and picks up MW numbers from the tags (which however has not been the case in the past 4 days)
4. Once the MDEA fax arrives and is synchronized with Services, hit ""Edit Actual-MW values"" in OATI : Daily checkout under shceduling. Put in the same values as the MDEA fax (system load) and the synchronized Services' "" Actual Net Tie"" (which should by now agree with System Load of the MDEA fax). 
5. Hit ""Apply"". Now OATI and Services should agree on ""Actual-MW values"" and ""Actual Net Tie"". They should also agree on ""Inadvertent"" and ""Imbalance"" respectively. (If not, Eric told me there was a procedure by where one could build a dummy tag just to make OATI agree (apparently they have had this problem before , since they have a solution for it) but assured me that we would not need to worry about that).
6. After this go through the normal procedure explained in the night desk duties email. 

This is only my understanding of it and might be completely flawed. However I think there might be some merit to it since we fax over the Net Tie report and the printouts of our OATI(scheduled and next day) to EES. The reason being that they can check on their OATI and see if they agree or not. (I also assume that they do not have a similar Services application as ours since that would obviate the need for OATI checkouts). Which, again is why it is so imperative that our Services and OATI agree. 

Lastly, in case I am horribly wrong on the above and someone decides to take it up to instruct me for the better, I shall be available at 303-693-1965 for the remainder of my holiday and on 720-320-4270 for 24/7.

Happy New Year to all of you and your families. May the new year bring more certainty and better fortune for all of us.

Adios, for now,

Punit.

"Propositions and city council candidates","League City to Elect New Council Member
 Ballot Includes Open Council Seat, Community Center and Charter Amendments
   League City voters will decide on Saturday who will replace City Council
Member Tad Nelson who resigned to run for the legislature, whether or not to
build a much-debated community center and the fate of 12 proposed charter
amendments.

Three candidates are seeking the vacant City Council Position 3.  They are
Thomas Cones, a 41-year old firefighter; Mike Hembree, a 36-year old
engineer;  and David Kilpatrick, a 46-year old senior engineering technician.
There are 13 propositions on the Ballot.
Proposition 1 is the vote on whether to construct the proposed community
center.
The remaining propositions are proposed charter amendments:.
Proposition 2 would move the regular election of the mayor and council
members to the first Saturday in May and specify the procedures for a runoff
election.  The charter currently calls for elections in April.
Proposition 3 increases the dollar amount of contracts that the city council
may approve, to come into compliance with state law.
Proposition No. 4 is similar in wording to Proposition 1, but amending
another section of the charter, specifying that the regular election for
mayor and council members whose terms are expiring shall be held on the first
Saturday of May.
Proposition 5 makes the charter gender neutral and specifies the time frame
for filing for mayor and council elections.
Proposition 6 requires that a winning candidate receive a majority of the
votes, rather than a plurality.
Proposition 7 requires that persons signing petitions for initiative or
referendum have been registered to vote in the last general city election.
Proposition 8 would bring the language of the one section of the charter out
of the 20th Century, specifying ""the year ____"" rather than ""the year 19__""?
Proposition 9 increases the amount that the city manager can spend without a
vote of the city council from $2,000 to the limit set by the state
constitution.
Proposition 10 takes the city council out of the process of making renditions
of the value of personal property, and requires that any inventory of any
taxable personal property in the city must be filed by April 15 of each year.
Proposition 11 would require that the city council cast votes for the Board
of Directors of the Galveston County Central Appraisal District.
Proposition 12 would specify that the central appraisal district not be
required to ""make separate appraisals of joint or conflicting interests in
real property.""
Proposition 13 specifies that ""early voting"" will be treated the same as
""absentee voting"".
The Guidry News Service Online News Station will provide election returns
Saturday night.

"Insights For You From InvestorPlace.com","
  InvestorPlace.com Insights    [IMAGE]Special Investing Bulletin From InvestorPlace.com Advisor Michael Murphy Editor, Technology Investing   December 14, 2001  Buy This Stock Now?and Reap BIG Profits From the Biggest Lie in Technology Today      Microsoft's new operating system, Windows XP, was released in November and is currently selling at record-breaking retail levels. Funny thing is, no one's talking about the most exciting aspect of this system?or the money it can make savvy investors who understand where to invest. That's what I want to tell you about today.  You see, Windows XP transforms the Internet into a poor-man's version of the virtual private network. The promise has actually     A word from our sponsor  Low-Cost Term Life Insurance...and no hassles!   We've been serving the needs of smart investors for the past 114 years. Click here , and in less than 5 minutes you'll have a FREE, custom quote from Ameritas Direct, a division of top-rated Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. For some of the LOWEST term rates available, please check us out TODAY.     been out there for quite some time. But frankly, the operating system couldn't handle all the complexities of doing Internet videoconferences.  Well, now it finally can. All it takes is a $100 camera?a couple of speakers?and a phone line. You can share a spreadsheet, a white board, any sort of collaborative notes-and hold a productive, real-time meeting without ever leaving your desk. It's PERFECT for the home office. A fantastic face-to-face sales tool. Heck, we're installing the cameras all over the place at my offices for immediate feedback-something that's of critical importance in the money management world.  In short, the point I'm trying to make is that video Internet meetings finally really work-for the first time-thanks to Microsoft XP. And I know from experience, there's a huge PENT-UP DEMAND. What's more, the recent terrorist events will only increase the desire for virtual face-to-face meetings, instead of actual travel. Now Let Me Show You What All That Demand Does to Capacity...and How You Can Profit From This Trend   Let's say you have a group of five people that e-mail back and forth regularly. But now they have the opportunity for a half-hour Internet meeting. That single video face-to-face eats the same equivalent bandwidth of one year's worth of their e-mails!  Now let's say they love the experience-and they will. Pretty soon they're meeting regularly. They all hook up a system at home to     A word from our sponsor  Free Investment Seminar...  Join InvestorPlace.com editors & other top Wall Street advisors at The 24th Annual Florida Money Show. Admission is FREE.... For details click here , or call 800/970-4355. Mention priority #001071.        chat with friends across the country. After all, it really is the next best thing to being there?and it's DIRT-CHEAP-airtime is free-as well.  What industry-which company-will benefit most from this soaring demand? To answer that question, I need to tell you about one of the biggest secrets in technology today. Call it a misconception, if you will.   I call it a bald-faced lie-one that has individual investors completely in the dark about an opportunity of immense proportions. I'm talking about the so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic cable.  As I've been telling my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers, I believe the build-out has really just begun. In fact, I can prove it. And companies that make the fiber are tremendous long-term investments.  But right now, I want to fill you in on just one aspect of the fiber business that will make you quite rich, a whole lot quicker.  Here's the deal: Yes, there is a large amount of unutilized fiber optic cable out there today. But that's not a problem for the tech industry. It's an opportunity.   You see, 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""-that is, it's not activated. At a recent investment conference, I explained it like this: ""You know what dark fiber has in common with a bushel of wheat? You can't send data over either one of them.""  Before this fiber can be used, it has to be ""lit."" Who do you call to do the job? You call Nortel, you call Cisco, you call Lucent. Then they all call ONE COMPANY to get the parts. THAT'S the stock I want you to buy now.  Low Risk With Ten-Bagger Potential  I'm looking at a double-possibly a triple-by this time next year!   And I fully expect to multiply our money 10-times over by 2007. Best of all, this stock is so beaten-down, there's little risk from here. Point is, if I'm right-and I'll gladly stake my reputation on this call-just a small investment now can make you a huge pile of cash. The stock? None other than optical powerhouse JDS Uniphase (NASDAQ: JDSU).  Here's my reasoning:  When the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down-very noticeably slowed down. What does that mean? There isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the system to accommodate a blip in demand.  I believe people in government are very worried about this problem. After all, this is the second time it's happened. Back in July, a tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full days because an optical cable got caught in the snare.  That means our communications systems-and therefore our economy-are very, very vulnerable.  Ten years ago, it wouldn't have mattered. But today, commerce and security is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on those systems. Virtually nothing moves without it. That's how banks and brokerages transfer funds?how dispatchers route fleets of trucks?how many Americans get paid through direct deposit.  And we are closer to the breaking point than 99.9% of Americans even begin to understand. Here's one example.  Qwest-one of America's biggest carriers-recently said they're 63% loaded on their network. That doesn't sound too bad?until you understand how these networks operate. You can't load a network much past 65%. In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic-because the network spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any time actually sending packets of information.  The system locks. Communications stops. The nation comes to a standstill. Quite simply, America is falling behind the rest of the developed world, and we've got to catch up fast!  Internet traffic systems currently run faster in Australia, Europe and even South America. That's because we push out more data than everyone else-but we're not increasing capacity at anywhere near the needed rate.  Get this-data traffic is DOUBLING every year now. That means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by this time next year just to keep up. That's why the fiber must-and will-be lit. Otherwise business, the economy and our national security are all in the crapper.  So how does a smart investor profit? As I mentioned, the Big 3 systems manufacturers (Nortel, Cisco and Lucent) handle the contracts. But they're all in tough competition with one another. I prefer JDSU, which gives these guys the TOOLS they need to do the job.  There's very little credible competition at that end. If you want reliability, great service and appealing cost structures, it's the ONLY place to turn.  At the height of the boom, JDS Uniphase's stock was nearly 20-times higher. What changed? Spending on communications networks dried up. Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore-it's a question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why I'm so sure of the immense opportunity ahead if you invest in JDSU today. What's more (here's the best part!) this is NOT the only fiber optic play I'm recommending my TECHNOLOGY INVESTING readers load up on now.   For the full story-and my complete recommendation on JDSU and other top tech picks-I want to tell you about a very special opportunity. Sign up for my FREE email seminar, ""Success Secrets of a Tech Stock Pro"" now, and each week for the next month, I'll send you a special investing bulletin just like this one-profit-packed with the very best tech investing opportunities today?the full story on JDSU and the fiber ""glut""?my top biotech pick for 2002?the 4 questions you must ask before buying a single tech stock next year?ways to avoid the technology investing mistakes that cost most investors millions of dollars in profits this year?and MUCH, MUCH more!

"Message from Ken Lay","Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

"Vandalism in the village","Once again we have had some vandalism in CCV.  It is a shame to put all of
your hard work into lighting up the yard and have you decorations vandalized.
 Police reports have been made and extra patrols are being added.  Please
call the police and let us know if you see or have any vandalism.  This time
Peggy Zahler has had her light wires cut twice.  It is not the time taken to
put up the lights or the money and time required to get new lights, it is the
aggravation and the simple feeling that you are being taken advantage of.  We
take pride int the fact that Clear Creek Village attracts a lot of attention
during the holidays because you all do such a wonderful job of decorating.
Please be watchful and call League City PD.
Thank you.  Mary G. Strickland

ENRON AFTERSHOCKS

The ENRON scandal hit Washington, with links between Kenneth Lay,
Enron's chairman, and George Bush and other Texas Republicans coming
under scrutiny. ANDERSEN, Enron's auditor, admitted that thousands of
documents relating to the audit had been destroyed, some after an
investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission had begun. An
inside letter came to light warning Mr Lay in August that Enron could
""implode in a wave of accounting scandals"". And some reports suggested
that Andersen knew of Enron's troubles as long ago as last February.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVJ0UBQN0Mo0qjY0AX

KPMG also suffered severe censure at the hands of the SEC. The ""big
five"" auditor had invested funds with Short-Term Investments Trust, an
investment firm that it also audited. KPMG pleaded that it had made the
investment through a third party.

- - - - - See article: The real scandal uncovered by Enron
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVJ0UBQN0Mo0qjZ0AY

J.P. MORGAN CHASE announced a fourth-quarter loss of $332m, compared
with a profit of $708m a year earlier. Much of the loss was due to
Enron and Argentina. The bank earlier revised estimates for its total
exposure to Enron from $900m to $2.6 billion.

NOT FOR SALE

Investors reacted angrily on discovering that RHODIA, a French
chemicals company, had rejected an offer, with a hefty premium, from
DSM, a Dutch rival. Rhodia has struggled in a consolidating industry
but its management rebuffed the offer, perhaps as it would have lost
influence.

Three rivals made a successful joint bid of EURO2.5 billion ($2.2
billion) for RODAMCO NORTH AMERICA, America's third-largest
shopping-mall company. Australia's Westfield Holding (which has a 24%
stake in the company), America's Simon Property Group, the country's
largest mall owner, and Rouse will divide up Rodamco's 35 malls.

CAR TROUBLE

FORD announced a fourth-quarter loss of $5.1 billion, bringing losses
for the year to $5.5 billion. The loss included a $4.1 billion charge
for a restructuring that will include capacity cuts, plant closures and
the loss of 35,000 jobs.

GENERAL MOTORS said that profits for the fourth quarter were down by
58% to $225m from a year earlier. A faltering economy and an
interest-free financing deal slashed profits at its mainstay North
American vehicles business.

GENERAL ELECTRIC, the world's biggest company by stockmarket
capitalisation, reported a 9% rise in profits for the fourth quarter,
to $3.9 billion.

The online auctioneer, EBAY, made record profits in the fourth quarter.
Operating profits jumped by 56% over a year ago, to $42m.

AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, reported losses for the
fourth quarter of $798m. The economy and the after-effects of September
11th contributed to the record loss.

KMART suffered the indignity of a ""junk"" debt rating from Moody's and
relegation from the S&P 500 index after its shares slumped and
bankruptcy loomed. America's second-biggest discount retailer has
failed to do better after its latest restructuring and suffered a
dismal Christmas. Its shares hit a 36-year low.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVJ0UBQN0Mo0qja0Af

The WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION ruled in favour of the EU and ordered
America to repeal a system of tax breaks for its exporters. However,
Europe's right to retaliate with sanctions equal to the $4 billion
hidden subsidy will be tempered by reluctance to start a full-blooded
trade war.

SUCCESSION PLANNING?

A possible successor to Sandy Weill at CITIGROUP emerged. Robert
Willumstad assumed the newly created post of president. But Mr Weill,
chairman and chief executive of the financial-services giant, may have
acted to keep investors happy by seeming to anoint a crown prince while
keeping his options open; he may stay put for many more years.

DEUTSCHE BANK is preparing a big shake-up that would shift away from
its consensus-based management board and instead give its prospective
chairman, Josef Ackermann, power akin to an American chief executive
when he takes over in May.

The chairman, chief executive and a senior manager at SOCIETE GENERALE
became the latest bankers to be questioned by French police looking
into money-laundering allegations. A wider probe by the French
authorities has lasted three years and involved many of the country's
leading banks.

PRICES DOWN

America's consumer-price index fell by 0.2% in December to 1.6% for the
year as energy costs dived. The diminishing fear of INFLATION may make
it easier for the Federal Reserve to consider cutting interest rates
yet again at its next meeting at the end of the month.

"You're MISSING OUT!  UP 69% already!","As a valued member of the INVESTools community, you've
asked to be notified about new investment tools, features,
and money-saving opportunities from INVESTools and our
strategic partners.  We think you'll be interested in this
exciting offer from Phillips Publishing Inc.

To unsubscribe, see the link at the end of this email.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Investor,

So far you've missed 69% gains.  Wait any longer, and you'll miss the
best shot at a ten-bagger you'll ever get!

A while back I wrote to you about what I call ""the biggest lie in
technology today""...

...and offered you a FREE bulletin on the ONE stock best positioned for
enormous gains, as this story unfolds.  A stock that could easily DOUBLE
your money in short order...and then make your fortune several times
over in the next few years.

To me, it's CRAZY that I haven't heard back from you.  After all, this
is an entirely FREE piece of information--with no obligation on your
part.  You have nothing to lose.  And--judging by our gains so far--a
pile of money to make.

Since I started pounding the table for this stock after the September
crisis, it's UP 69%!  But DON'T WORRY.  There's still time to get in on
the lion's share of the gains.  The really BIG PROFITS--3 or 4-times
what we've made so far--will come as the economy recovers this year.
And that's why the perfect time to buy this POWERHOUSE company is NOW.

IN JUST A MOMENT, I'll tell you how to get the name of this stock,
complete details and my full ""buy instructions""--absolutely FREE,
without obligation of any kind.

But first, it's imperative that you know the truth about technology's
biggest lie: The so-called ""glut"" of fiber optic cable.

WHEN the World Trade Center got hit, the Internet slowed down--very
noticeably slowed down.  In fact, it nearly came to a grinding halt!
That means there isn't enough capacity or redundancy built into the
system to accommodate a blip in demand.

Sources tell me that the government is very worried about this problem.
After all, this is the second time it's happened.  Back in July, a
tunnel fire in Baltimore slowed the Internet to a crawl for two full
days.

That means our communications systems--and therefore our economy--are
very, very vulnerable.  And we are closer to the BREAKING POINT than
99.9% of Americans even begin to understand.  Here's one example.

Qwest--one of America's biggest carriers--recently said they're 60%
loaded on their network.  That doesn't sound too bad...until you
understand how these networks operate.  You can't load a network much
past 65%.  In fact, 70% is virtually catastrophic--because the network
spends so much time searching for open channels, it doesn't spend any
time actually sending packets of information.

The system locks.  Communications stops.  The nation comes to a
standstill.  And business, the economy and our national security all go
in the CRAPPER.

BUT WHY do we have this capacity problem amidst a ""fiber glut?""  Because
 95% of all the fiber that has ever been laid is ""dark""--that is, it's
not activated.  And the company I'm recommending is the #1 supplier of
the components needed to do the job.  I'm looking at a DOUBLE--possibly
a TRIPLE by this time next year.  And I fully expect to multiply our
money five-times over by 2007.  In fact, this stock truly has
""ten-bagger"" potential!

So get in on the action.  Click on the link below to get the name of
this stock--This TOP PICK is absolutely FREE and without obligation, but
only for a limited time.  It's my way of introducing you to my
award-winning Technology Investing advisory--but there's no obligation
of any kind.

I think you'll find this FREE offer well worth your while.  In 1999--the
last time tech stocks started from such depressed levels--my clients
earned 157%, as verified by The Hulbert Financial Digest.  And that
earned us Hulbert's #1 RANKING for all investment advisories!

So far, we've made 69% in this fiber-optics POWERHOUSE since
mid-September.  You've missed out so far.  Don't miss out on the much
BIGGER GAINS to come,

At the height of the boom, this company's stock was nearly 20-times
higher.  But then the economy tanked and spending on communications
networks dried up.  Now the government is ready to pump $100 billion in
emergency spending into the economy; interest rates are practically
zero; and the need isn't just vital for the economy anymore--it's a
question of NATIONAL SECURITY!  That's why this next move up will be so
powerful.

Please don't miss out.

You've got nothing to lose by taking advantage of this FREE--no strings
attached--introductory offer.  Click here to sign up now:

http://www.ppi-orders.com/index.htm?promo_code=0ML234

Sincerely,

Michael Murphy
TECHNOLOGY INVESTING

P.S.  The longer you wait, the more profits you MISS OUT on.  This
""ten-bagger"" has a long ways to run--but it's already UP 69% since
mid-September, in recognition of this company's vital new role in
national security.

Dark fiber does no good.  Actual carrying capacity is strained to the
limits.  And get this--data traffic is DOUBLING every year now.  That
means a network running at 63% of capacity needs to double its load by
this time next year just to keep up.  That's why the fiber must be lit.
That's why the fiber will be lit.  Click here to take advantage of this
FREE opportunity now.

Subject:	FW: the newlyweds


> A newlywed couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband,
> although very much in love, couldn't wait to go out on the town and party
> with his old buddies. So, he said to his new wife, ""Honey, I'll be right

> ""Where are you going, coochy cooh...?"" asked the wife.
> ""I'm going to the bar, pretty face. I'm going to have a beer.""
> The wife said, ""You want a beer, my love?"" She opened the door to the
> refrigerator and showed him 25 different kinds of beer, brands from 12
> different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.
> The husband didn't know what to do, and the only thing that he could think

> have frozen glasses...""
> He didn't get to finish the sentence, because the wife interrupted him by
> saying, ""You want a frozen glass, puppy face?"" She took a huge beer mug
> out of the freezer, so frozen that she was getting chills just holding it.

> The husband, looking a bit pale, said, ""Yes, tootsie roll, but at the bar

> ""You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?"" She opened the oven and took out
> 15 dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket,
> mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.
> ""But sweet honey...at the bar...you know...there's swearing, dirty words

> ""You want dirty words, cutie pie?""...

PRISONERS' DILEMMA

The United States came under fire from human-rights organisations for
classifying the AL-QAEDA prisoners it is detaining in Cuba as ""unlawful
combatants"" rather than prisoners-of-war, thereby denying them rights
under the Geneva Conventions.

- - - - - See article: The rights of terrorists
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjK0AQ

The Justice Department said that John Walker, a young American who
joined the TALIBAN, will be brought back to the United States to face
charges in federal criminal court of aiding terrorism, including
conspiracy to kill American citizens.

- - - - - See article: America's views on the Afghan prisoners
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjL0AR

A PRETZEL got the better of President George Bush when he choked on it
while watching a football game. Mr Bush fainted and collapsed but later
resumed a tour of the country with no apparent ill effects apart from a
large bruise on his cheek.

ZONE OF UNCERTAINTY

COLOMBIA'S peace process limped on. Hours before President Andres
Pastrana planned to order the army to retake a guerrilla-controlled
""peace zone"", the FARC rebels agreed to restart talks, despite
government surveillance of the zone. But to renew the life of the zone,
Mr Pastrana wants the FARC to agree to immediate negotiations for a
ceasefire.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjM0AS

In ARGENTINA, several branches of foreign banks were wrecked during
further protests against controls on bank withdrawals. After a
devaluation which ended a decade in which the peso was fixed at par
with the dollar, it sank quickly to around 1.85.

- - - - - See article: More protests in Argentina
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjN0AT

In a sweeping government shuffle, Jean Chretien, CANADA'S long-serving
prime minister, named John Manley, formerly the country's foreign
minister, as his deputy and seeming heir apparent. Mr Chretien said he
would stay in his job?at least until next Christmas.

- - - - - See article: Canada's government shake-up
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjO0AU

VIOLENCE AS USUAL

Tit-for-tat violence intensified in the ISRAELI-OCCUPIED TERRITORIES. A
Palestinian militia group, linked to Fatah, killed two Israeli settlers
after one of its own leaders was assassinated, presumably by Israel.
Widespread protest erupted after the Palestinian Authority arrested
Ahmad Saadat, wanted by Israel in connection with the murder of its
tourism minister.

http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjP0AV

An IRANIAN DEPUTY, imprisoned for speaking his mind in parliament, was
pardoned by the country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, after
the speaker threatened to paralyse parliament's business.

- - - - - See article: Rattling the supreme one
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjQ0AW

KUWAIT celebrated with national holidays, the distribution of free
trees to every home and the slaughtering of sheep as its ruler returned
from four months of medical treatment in London after suffering a brain
haemorrhage.

A general strike froze NIGERIAN CITIES, as unions protested against a
recent 18% rise in the heavily subsidised price of petrol. The
government declared the strike illegal and arrested union officials.

Under international pressure, ZIMBABWE postponed passing a law aimed at
making life hard for independent journalists. But opposition activists
continued to be murdered, allegedly by Robert Mugabe's militia. Britain
promised to stop deporting Zimbabwean asylum-seekers.

- - - - - See article: Trouble in Zimbabwe
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjR0AX

In MADAGASCAR, the constitutional court ordered a recount of last
month's presidential election, which had yielded no clear winner.

The opposition in ZAMBIA filed a petition to have the result of their
country's presidential election nullified, alleging vote-rigging by the
ruling party, whose candidate won. Opposition offices were promptly
raided by police.

CONSERVATIVE CHOICE

Germany's two main conservative parties picked Edmund Stoiber, premier
of Bavaria and leader of the Christian Social Union, as their candidate
to become GERMANY'S CHANCELLOR after a general election later this
year. The leader of the much larger Christian Democratic Union, Angela
Merkel, had withdrawn her bid for the candidacy.

- - - - - See article: Edmund Stoiber
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjS0AY

FRANCE'S main business organisation, Medef, demanded cuts in taxes and
social charges, and the easing of labour laws. The Constitutional
Council had already ruled against parts of a recent law that would bar
lay-offs through redundancy except in extreme circumstances.

- - - - - See article: France's bosses are feeling hogtied
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjT0AZ

In CYPRUS the leaders of the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot
communities opened face-to-face negotiations. Outsiders hope that the
talks will lead to a deal bringing the breakaway ""Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus"" back into the fold as part of an island united,
however loosely, under a single central government.

Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, visited POLAND, the first leader of
his country to do so since 1993.

Norway's finance minister, Per-Kristian Foss, revealed that he had
formalised his long-term GAY PARTNERSHIP under Norwegian law.

Will Britain and Spain agree to joint sovereignty over GIBRALTAR? Some
British MPs erupted over press reports that the deal was done already.
Not so, said the British government, po-faced.

- - - - - See article: Joint sovereignty for Gibraltar?
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjU0Aa

PAT COX, an Irish liberal, was elected as president of the European
Parliament.

WAR AVERTED?

Tension between INDIA and PAKISTAN eased after the Pakistani president,
General Pervez Musharraf, ordered a crackdown on militants blamed for a
recent attack on the Indian Parliament.

- - - - - See article: The problem of Kashmir
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjV0Ab

The World Bank said that rebuilding AFGHANISTAN will cost $15 billion.
As the central bank reopened in Kabul, the governor said he had more
money in his wallet than was in the bank's safe.

- - - - - See article: Reluctant donors
http://news.economist.com/cgi-bin1/flo?y=eVQ0UBQN0Mo0qjW0Ac

Afghanistan's interim government banned cultivation of the opium poppy
and trafficking in its derivatives, including HEROIN. Afghan farmers
have started to sow the poppy since the defeat of the Taliban, who
imposed a similar ban.

EAST TIMOR is to set up a truth and reconciliation commission as a
""healing process"" like the one in South Africa that probed
apartheid-era crimes.
