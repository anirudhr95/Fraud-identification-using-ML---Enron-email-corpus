"Mandatory Harassment Avoidance Training","
Harassment Avoidance Training

To contribute our personal best at Enron, our conduct must promote respectful and co-operative work relationships.  Workplace harassment conflicts with Enron's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

During this training you will:
Be able to recognize harassment
Learn to take precautions against being harassed
Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
Know how to address a situation involving harassment
Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with Enron Values

Go to <http://elm.enron.com> to sign up for the session of your choice.  Harassment Avoidance is listed in the Compliance Category.  If you have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713-853-0357.

The date and times available for sessions are:


Day	Date	Session I	Session II	Session III	
Wednesday	Sept 19	1:30 - 2:45	3:00 - 4:15	4:30 - 5:45

"Enron/Dynegy Merger; Antitrust Issues","
As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

"Access Card Information","Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

"Small logic error","John,
 
I found the error.  It was a small logic error.
 
You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file.  In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file.  You will need to edit the ""Main_Query"" module.
 
Once in the ""Main_Query"" module, you will need to search for the routine named ""VerifyManualInputs"".  The actual start of the routine looks like this:
 
Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean

 
Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines :
 
  If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then
    If (ToDate < FromDate) Then
 
You need to change the second line to :
    
    If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then
 
This should fix the problem.  The intent of the line is to prevent the ""To Date"" of a deal from being earlier than the ""From Date"".  In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is ""ABC"" < ""DEF"") instead of comparing the two values as DATES.  The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing.
 
I have tested the fix here and it should work fine.
 
I hope everything runs smooth for you next week.
 
Have a good Thanksgiving.
 
Greg

"Fire Sale--REAL HUMAN SKELETON!","John:

I'm used to calling you Johnny so please let me know your preference.

Anyway, I just wanted to follow up on our conversation about selling my 'bones.'    I'm going to scan a picture of her as soon as I can and forward that to you as well.    

I forgot to mention that the guys I bought it from were Oddfellows, which is a fraternal organization kind of like the Masons except for lower class types (their words).  If your'e not familiar with the Oddfellows, they made the news recently because they use skeleton's in their initiation rituals.  Very odd indeed.  They guys told me the bones are female....I don't know how to tell.

Talk soon, Peter

"Historical Correlation Calculator","I finished a spreadsheet for calculating historical correlations on forward curves. It gives the correlation matrix for contracts going out an arbritary number of months out. I think it might be a handy tool for some of you.

You may get that on O:\RESEARCH\CUSTOM\CORRELMATRIX\

It demands that you have access to our EGSPROD32 database. You must have that configured in your ODBC. It is a large spreadsheet, so it may take some computing resorces. Let me know if you find any problem.

""Here is the announcement: Reliant Energy Weather Risk Management Group has developed
Weather-sensitive Gas Load Indices (""WGLI""),  indices that measure national
or regional residential and commercial gas consumption during the heating
season. We believe the indices will provide valuable information for gas
traders as well as other market participants.  We plan to make a swap
market in the indices in the near future. We hope the WGLI swaps will
become a new financial tool to help you or your clients to better manage
their risks associated with the fluctuation of gas demand.""

Ever notice how a 4  year old's voice is louder than 200 adult  voices?
----------------------------
Several years ago, I returned home  from a trip just when a storm hit
with crashing thunder and severe lightning.  As I came into my bedroom
about 2 a.m., I found my two children in bed with  my wife, Karey,
apparently scared by the loud storm. I resigned myself to  sleep in the
guest bedroom that night. The next day, I talked to the  children, and
explained that it was O.K. to sleep with Mom when the storm was  bad, but
when I was expected home, please don't sleep with Mom that night.  They
said ok. After my next trip several weeks later, Karey and the  children
picked me up in the terminal at the appointed time. Since the plane  was
late, everyone had come into the terminal to wait for my  plane's
arrival, along with hundreds of other folks waiting for their  arriving
passengers. As I entered the waiting area, my son saw me, and came  running
shouting, ""Hi, Dad! I've got some good news!"" As I waved back, I  said
loudly, ""What's the good news?"" ""Nobody slept with Mommy while you were  away
this time!"" Alex shouted. The
airport became very quiet, as everyone  in the waiting area looked at
Alex, then turned to me, and then searched the  rest of the area to see
if they could figure out exactly who his Mom  was.
----------------------------
An acquaintance of mine who is a  physician told this story about her
then 4 yr. old daughter. On the way to  preschool, the doctor had left
her stethoscope on the car seat, and her  little girl picked it up and
began playing with it. 'Be still, my heart,'  thought my friend, 'my daughter
wants to follow in my footsteps!'
Then the  child spoke into the instrument: ""Welcome to McDonald's. May I
take your  order?""
-----------------
A certain little girl, when asked her name,  would reply, ""I'm Mr.
Sugarbrown's daughter."" Her mother told her this was  wrong, she must
say, ""I'm Jane Sugarbrown."" The pastor spoke to her in Sunday  School,
and said, ""Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"" She replied,  ""I
thought I was, but mother says I'm not.""
-----------------
A Sunday  school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church  service, ""And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?""
One bright little  girl replied,""Because people are sleeping.""
-----------------
At the  beginning of a children's sermon, one girl came up to the altar
wearing a  beautiful dress. As the children were sitting down around the
pastor, he  leaned over and said to the girl, ""That is a very pretty
dress. Is it your  Easter dress?"" The girl replied almost directly into
the pastor's clip-on  mike, ""Yes, and
my Mom says it's a bitch to  iron.""
-----------------
And my personal favorite --- A little girl goes  to the barber shop with
her father. She stands next to the barber chair,  while her dad gets his
hair cut, eating a snack cake. The barber says to her,  ""Sweetheart,
you're gonna get hair on your Twinkie."" She says, ""Yes, I know,  and I'm
gonna get boobs too.""

Steve,

	John Griffith, a financial trader has approached me asking for some support of some risk/trade worksheets that he had been receiving help
from Greg Couch on.  Franky Sulistio is currently working with John to learn these applications so that he can help, but John is really looking for
a more risk knowledgeable resources, one that can support him from front to back office.  Greg Couch was apparently developing a good bit of
stuff for him and risk.

Do you know who I could point him to for this support?

"Option Grid Changes to show months with 0 value","

John,


I went through the code and realized that the change to show months with 0 value is a little big change and cannot be done in hours. The problem I see is that when portcalc values a post id, it does not create any data in database for the months where you do not have positions. What it means it can be done but it will take minimum 3-4 days to make the changes, test it and give it to you. Also it will slow down option grid a little more as I need to build rows with 0 values which are not in database. I just wanted to give you an update and I will talk to Karima & Francis to let them know how we are going to handle it.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Subject:  Open Mouth, Insert Foot



1. CURL UP AND DIE
I walked into a hair salon with my husband and three kids in town and asked
loudly, ""How much do you charge for a shampoo and a blow job?""
- Melinda Lowe, 39, Seguin TX

2. PAD PLEASE
An insurance man visited me at home to talk about our mortgage insurance.
He was throwing a lot of facts and figures at me, and I wanted to follow as
best I could, so I told my 6-year-old son to run and get me a pad. He came
back and handed me a Kotex right in front of our guest.
- Kate Newman, 46,Winston-Salem, NC

3. HO, HO, HO
I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came into the bathroom and
wrapped himself in toilet paper. Although he made a mess, he looked
adorable, so I ran for my camera and took a few shots. They came out so
well that I had copies made and included one with each of our Christmas
cards.  Days later, a relative called about the picture, laughing
hysterically,and suggesting I take a closer look. Puzzled, I stared at
the photo and was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had
captured my reflection in the mirror wearing nothing but a camera!
- Name Withheld

4. LADY GOLFER
I was at the golf store comparing different kinds of golf balls. I was
unhappy with the women's type I had been using. After browsing for several
minutes, I was approached by one of the good-looking gentlemen who works at
the store. He asked if he could help me.Without thinking, I looked at him
and said, ""I think I like playing  with men's balls.""
- Colleen Collins, 31, Ferndale, MI

5. NUTS ABOUT YOU
My sister and I were at the mall and passed by a store that sold a variety
of nuts. As we were looking at the display case, the boy behind the counter
asked if we needed any help. I replied, ""No, I'm just looking at your
nuts.""
My sister started to laugh hysterically, the boy grinned, and I turned
beet-red and walked away. To this day, my sister  has never let me forget.
- Faye Emerick, 34, Ellerslie, MD

"(no subject)","Happy Thanksgiving !!!!! Hope your's was as good as mine.  I didn't come to Houston, I'm saving my time for Christmas, so I spent time with Robyn, Jay & boys.  We ate at Furr's and went to the movies (the boys & Robyn-Harry Potter, Jay & I-Training Day) we had a good time and to top it off I got to see Mike, Rhonda & kids.  Everyone seems to be adjusting to the move. They said if I see you to tell you Hi. 
I'll be coming to Houston on Sat before Christmas, Please let me see you guys before I leave on Wednesday. 
Love You
