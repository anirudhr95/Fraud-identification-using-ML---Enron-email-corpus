"","Greg,

I want to thank you so much for all you work on the trade blotter.  We are getting close here.  I put together a list of items to get the thing completely operational.  Below is the list and maybe we could talk today to discuss.  Thanks.

BLOTTER

 - rearrange the deal input screen
 - have Amy's sheet pull deals from access database
 - get Mike Maggi's computer set up for the access database
 - build a spreadsheet to take a snapshot of the blotter for Mike Maggi
 - set up a default month for the deal input screen (possibly an input on the spreadsheet)
 - have deal input screen popup on the screen that the spreadsheet is open in
 - on morning macro, include clear trades, clear charm, clear theta and clear recon numbers
 - separate price and vol on the Fetch Curves button
 - delete evening macro
 - add button for settle prices
 - add button to print position, pnl, options and swap pages (one button)
 - test multiple user input on the deal input spreadsheet

This list might look like alot, but I think most items will only take a few minutes to correct or change.  Let me know when you get a chance to sit down and talk about this.  Thanks.

John Griffith

Hi John,
I hope things are going well for you. Sorry I could not contact you earlier
- had been really busy wrapping up things. Thanks for stopping the other day
and inquiring about me. I have an H-1 visa and have 6 weeks to find a job
after which I will be required to leave the country.

I am attaching a copy of my resume for you to review. I would appreciate
greatly if you could go over it and offer any suggestions on how I can
improve my chances of finding a job.

Thanks,
Bilal

John,

On the O drive you will not be allowed to create folders, as this is a common drive -- so all folders are created by IT (it was this way at Enron). The exception to this rule is if you are the owner of the ""main"" folder ... which in this case you are.

So ... to make a long story short, YOU will be able to create folders under this path that we have requested, but your team members won't. They will have to request access to do so.

Again, it's the same process as we used at Enron

thank

There are two correlation calculators that are now available in O:\Research\Custom\CorrelMatrix\.

CorrelAnalysis.xls can basket up to 3 curves and calculates the correlation matrix on contracts with different expirations.  This is particularly helpful when the correlation matrix is needed for NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

CorrelVolCalc.xls calculates the correlation between two baskets.  It can basket up to 3 curves in each basket, so this calculator is also able to handle NYMEX+basis+index calculations.

These calculators have been reviewed by the Research Group, and we feel that they are accurate.  Please let me (x53240) or Paulo Issler (x56274) know if you find any problems or have any questions about these new tools.

is done I will be leaving.  I will probably go directly to the Container

"","John,

As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.  

A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.

Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.

Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.

John

John:

I'm used to calling you Johnny so please let me know your preference.

Anyway, I just wanted to follow up on our conversation about selling my 'bones.'    I'm going to scan a picture of her as soon as I can and forward that to you as well.    

I forgot to mention that the guys I bought it from were Oddfellows, which is a fraternal organization kind of like the Masons except for lower class types (their words).  If your'e not familiar with the Oddfellows, they made the news recently because they use skeleton's in their initiation rituals.  Very odd indeed.  They guys told me the bones are female....I don't know how to tell.

Talk soon, Peter

"","John,

Thank you for pulling me aside and reinforcing your confidence in me and also putting things into perspective.  I guess the reason I was a little upset is that I feel that we are a family here.  I spend more time with you guys than I do with my wife.  I felt a little betrayed.  I should not have felt that way.  You guys have given me the oppurtunity of a lifetime, I am very thankful for that.  I have never questioned the importance of you or Mike of anyone on our desk.  

Please forgive me if I have been a little down.  I think that I am truly okay now.  It has been a very emotional couple of weeks with everything going on.  I know we will get through this.  I once again want to tell you that I am here for anything that needs to be done.  

You will not here about this situation again.  Thank you for understanding.  I put my total trust in you.  

John

"RE: MESSAGE FROM Alex","Hey what is going on?  I haven't talked to you in a few days and I feel lost.  First day at work in a while.  It feels weird.  I miss you very much.  I hope you have had a wonderful holiday season.  Mine has been okay.  Very long.  Not as good as it could have been.  I think about you every second of the day.  I am sorry I haven't called but the times I did call and I only had a limited amount of time, it didn't end good and I didn't want that to happen.  I want you to know that out of sight does not mean out of mind.  You are always on my mind.  I can't get by without thinking of you.  I have thought alot about my situation over the last couple of weeks.  I don't know how I am going to manage it but I need to make a change for myself.  I feel like I am in some sort of prison.  I need more freedom, I need more love, I need more affection, I need more life.  You probably try not to think about us because of the situation, I understand that, but I hope I haven't left your mind completely.  You are so special, so beautiful, wonderful, fun and I haven't even got to know you that well yet.  Have a wonderful New Year and please be careful.  Think about me.  I cherish the day I can see you again.

Subject: Small logic error


John,
 
I found the error.  It was a small logic error.
 
You can easily fix the problem if you go into the visual basic editor for the blotter file.  In the editor, you will see several modules listed on the left of the screen under the file.  You will need to edit the ""Main_Query"" module.
 
Once in the ""Main_Query"" module, you will need to search for the routine named ""VerifyManualInputs"".  The actual start of the routine looks like this:
 
Function VerifyManualInputs(FromDate As String, ToDate As String, PutCall As String, Lots As String, Strike As String, Price As String, CParty As String, sType As String) As Boolean

 
Within this routine, about 15-20 lines down, you should see the following two lines :
 
  If (isdate(FromDate) And isdate(ToDate)) Then
    If (ToDate < FromDate) Then
 
You need to change the second line to :
    
    If (CDate(ToDate) < CDate(FromDate)) Then
 
This should fix the problem.  The intent of the line is to prevent the ""To Date"" of a deal from being earlier than the ""From Date"".  In the original line of code, it does a TEXT based compare (like comparing is ""ABC"" < ""DEF"") instead of comparing the two values as DATES.  The modification I've laid out converts the from and to dates to date values before comparing.
 
I have tested the fix here and it should work fine.
 
I hope everything runs smooth for you next week.
 
Have a good Thanksgiving.
 
Greg
