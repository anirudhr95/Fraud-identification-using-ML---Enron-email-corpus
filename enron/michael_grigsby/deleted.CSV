"UPDATE - Supported Internet Email Addresses","
Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.
 
Enron Global Technology

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.

Marcus Pollard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scri! pt! =players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1335&> , TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.

Reggie Wayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place o! f ! the injured Jerome Pathon for the second consecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup. 

Marvin Harrison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1231&>, WR IND - Russell Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.

Peyton Manning <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=12531&>, QB IND - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&ow! ne! r=49699.10&random=892&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/18/01 
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1593&>, WR GB - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might have another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week.

Antowain Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1663&>, RB NE - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week i! f ! the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin. 

Laveranues Coles <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.

Curtis Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

! Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent game of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Upd! at! ed 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Neal/McKay Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.

Walter Rasby <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight en! d ! now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133310&>, WR STL - Tori Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bi! ge! 01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1294&>, WR STL - Frank Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
Canidate wil! l ! likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive! o! f the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/! mp! /elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1140&> , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/18/01
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Chad Lewis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=892&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday.  ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive.     </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3435&key=1160&""><B>Lamar Smith</B></A>, RB MIA - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco.

"Put up $5 to win $1 Million!","<!--
Do you know football? Would you pay $5 to enter an office
pool with a $1 Million grand prize? There are 3 weeks left
in the pro football season and someone is GUARANTEED to win
$1 Million in the Office Pool Challenge. There's still
plenty of time left for you to win, so sign up today!

http://poolchallenge.fantasy.sportsline.com/?r=esfb1225_opc

It's easy to play. Just predict which teams will cover the 
point spread each week.

If someone picks every game right in a week, that person is 
entered into a random drawing with everyone else who made 
""perfect picks"" during the season. If no one makes ""perfect 
picks"" - and so far no one has - then the 17 weekly high 
scorers are entered into a drawing for the $1 Million prize.
With 3 weeks left, you still have 3 chances to make perfect
picks or be one of the weekly high scorers... maybe you'll 
win all three weeks!

Someone is guaranteed to win $1 Million. With 3 weeks to go,
there's no reason it can't be you. Other prizes are up for 
grabs too - so SIGN UP TODAY and give it a shot!

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed higher on Monday as traders and investors
continue to gain confidence that the worst is behind us regarding the
economy. Expectations for an economic recovery during the first half
of 2002 along with U.S. military victories in Afghanistan also helped
support today's gains. The NASDAQ closed just above minor resistance
crossing at 1933.94. Multiple closes above this resistance level
would set the stage for a possible test of the 25% retracement level
of the 2000/2001 decline crossing at 2071.93 later this year. The
December S&P 500 index also closed higher on Monday and is poised to
test September?s high crossing at 1163.90 possibly on Tuesday. 

The Dow closed higher on Monday as it extended last week?s breakout
above this summer?s downtrend line. The stage is set for a possible
test of the 62% retracement level of the May/September decline
crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future. Investors remain encouraged
by reports of U.S. military victories in Afghanistan and ideas that
the worse might be over for the economy. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December T-bonds posted an inside day with a modestly higher close
due to short covering following last Friday?s spike below the 75%
retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at 104-29. Today?s
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday.
I would not be surprised to see another day or two of consolidation
above last Friday?s high. However, momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of
November If the decline resumes, September?s low crossing at 102-17
is December?s next likely target. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Monday due to strength in energies,
grains and livestock markets. However, closes above last week?s high
crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall?s rally. Momentum
indicators are overbought and have turned bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of November.
Closes below last week?s low at 186.23 would extend the CRB?s decline
off last week?s high.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed higher on Monday with the exception of
crude oil due to short covering ahead of the close. Early weakness
was tied to indications that Russia is not considering any cuts in
production. However, a short covering rebound in the markets ahead of
the close as traders begin to square some of their short positions
ahead of Tuesday?s API inventory report erased early losses. 

December crude oil closed lower on Monday but near session highs due
to a bounce ahead of the close. Early weakness led to a spike below
the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83.
Closes below this support level could lead to a test of the January
1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 later this year. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is still
possible into the end of November. 

December heating oil closed slightly higher on Monday due to a short
covering bounce ahead of the close. Session lows fell short of
testing the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000-rally crossing at
48.50. Monday?s high-range close leaves the door open for additional
short covering on Tuesday ahead of this week?s API inventory report.
Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is
possible into the end of November. 

December unleaded gas posted a key reversal up on Monday. However,
today?s short covering bounce fell short of testing broken support
crossing at 51.87. I would not be surprised to see additional short
covering on Tuesday as December consolidates some of its recent
losses. However, the door remains open for a possible test of the
June 1999 low crossing at 47.00 later this month. Momentum indicators
are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible
near-term. 

December Henry Hub natural gas closed higher on Monday confirming
last Friday?s upside reversal. Forecasts calling for colder
temperatures to move across the high demand regions of the country by
the end of November prompted today?s short covering rally. Closes
above last week?s high crossing at 2.87 would greatly increase the
odds that last week?s low marked a double bottom with October?s low.
Short- term momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral to
bullish hinting that a low is in or near. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar gapped up and closed higher on Monday but ended
the day below last Wednesday?s high at 117.05. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a breakout above this falls
trading range. Profit taking ahead of the close erased most of
today?s gains while leaving the door open for a setback on Tuesday.
If today?s gap were filled, it would indicate that the gap was an
exhaustion gap and today?s high was nothing more than a spike above
trading range. Stochastics are bullish but becoming overbought
hinting a short-term top might be in or is near. 

The December Swiss Franc closed lower on Monday but near session
highs due to a late-day bounce. Closes above last Friday?s high at
.6045 would renew its short covering bounce off last Wednesday?s low.
Closes below last week?s low at .5961 are needed to renew December?s
decline and set the stage for a likely test of the 50% retracement
level of the July/September rally crossing at .5944. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness is possible
during the later part of November. 

The December Canadian Dollar closed modestly higher on Monday as it
extended last week?s breakout above October?s broken downtrend line.
Today?s low-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on
Tuesday. If the rebound off last week?s low continues, the 25%
retracement level of the July/November decline crossing at .6322 is
December?s next upside target. Momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible near- term. 

The December Japanese Yen closed below October?s low crossing at
.8132 on Monday thereby opening the door for additional weakness into
the end of November. If the decline off September?s high continues,
July?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later this year.
Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling sideways to lower
prices are possible into the end of November. 

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold spiked below August?s reaction low crossing at 272.60
before a short covering bounce tempered some of today?s losses.
Closes below this key support level would open the door for a
possible test of August?s reaction low crossing at 268.40 later this
year. Strength in the U.S. Dollar and equities provided much of
today?s pressure on the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish
signaling that additional weakness is possible into the end of
November. 

December silver posted a new low close for November, as it appears
poised to renew this fall?s decline following the recent breakout
below key support crossing at 4.15. Close below 4.055 cents would
open the door for a test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later
this month. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways
to lower prices are possible near-term. 

December copper closed higher on Monday confirming last Friday?s key
reversal up. However, today?s low-range close leaves the door open
for a possible setback on Tuesday. Closes above last week?s high at
69.60 are needed to renew December?s rebound off November?s low.
Closes below 66.70 would all but confirm that a short-term top has
likely been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish but
becoming overbought hinting that a round of profit taking could begin
later this week. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn gapped up and closed higher on Monday due to technical
buying. Session highs tested the bottom of October?s gap crossing at
2.21 1/2. Closes above this resistance level would likely trigger
additional fund short covering now that this year?s harvest is almost
wrapped up. However, it will take closes above the top of October?s
gap crossing at 2.25 1/4, which coincides with this summer?s
downtrend line to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.
Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible into the end of November. 

March wheat closed fractionally higher on Monday as it extended last
Friday?s impressive rally. I would not be surprised to see a steady
to lower close on Tuesday as March might try and consolidate some of
its recent gains. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of
November. If the rebound off last week?s low continues, October?s
high at 3.03 is March?s next target. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed fractionally lower on Monday due to light
profit taking after filling October?s gap at 4.54 in early trading.
Additional pressure came from spillover weakness from soybean meal
however, losses were limited due to light producer selling. Closes
above today?s high are needed to open the door for a larger-degree
post-harvest rebound that could last into the end of the year.
Momentum indicators remain overbought while trend-following
indicators such as the ADX are entering bullish trend modes signaling
that sideways to higher prices are possible. 

December soybean meal closed sharply lower due to profit taking on
Monday after testing the upper boundary of the October/November
trading range crossing at 167. Today?s low- range close leaves the
door open for additional selling on Tuesday. Until December closes
above 167, it will remain a trading range affair. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs closed higher on Monday but near session lows due to
bull spreading by commercials and funds. Continued weakness in the
cash market along with spillover selling late in the day from bellies
also tempered early gains. If the rebound off last week?s low
continues, the early- November high crossing at 55.12 is February?s
next target. Closes above this resistance level are needed to extend
February?s rally off October?s low. Momentum indicators are neutral
to bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into
the end of November.

February cattle closed higher on Monday for the fifth day in a row
despite most traders calling last Friday?s cattle-on- feed report
bearish. February?s ability to rally on bearish news confirms that
the early-November decline had already factored in last Friday?s
bearish report. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of
today?s gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on Tuesday.
Closes above the September/October downtrend line crossing near 70.50
are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed lower on Monday due to first-notice day sales by
hedgers. With the market closed Thursday and Friday, today?s losses
might have been somewhat exaggerated. March needs to close above last
week?s high, which coincides with the 25% retracement level of the
May/October decline crossing at 53.04. Multiple closes above this
resistance level are needed to open the door for a larger-degree
rebound into the end of the year. Closes below last week?s low at
47.50 would confirm that a short-term top has been posted. 

March cocoa closed higher on Monday but near mid-range as it
consolidates above last February?s high at 1257. If this resistance
level is cleared, the March 1999 reaction high crossing at 1341 is
March?s next upside target. Momentum indicators have become
overbought while trend-following indicators such as the ADX are
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
the end of November. Today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for
sideways trading on Tuesday.

March sugar closed higher on Monday and appears poised to test the
50% retracement level of the June/October decline crossing at 755
later this month. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices are possible into late-November.
Closes below last Wednesday?s gap crossing at 726 would increase the
odds that a short- term top has likely been posted. 

March cotton closed lower on Monday amidst selling ahead of first
notice day. Heavy commercial and producer selling on Monday
overshadowed last Friday?s bullish export report indicating that the
short covering rebound off October?s low might be coming to an end.
While export demand has been strong with cumulative sales running at
83.3% of USDA?s projection compared with 61.9% for this time of near,
this year?s bumper U.S. crop will continue to limit near-term upside
potential in the market. Momentum indicators are bullish but
overbought warning bullish traders to use caution. Closes below last
Thursday?s low at 35.00 would confirm that a short-term top was
posted last Wednesday.

"Wednesday's P/L","Mike:  Everything in the P/L looks good to me.  I have attached the cover sheet and the reconciliation.  The estimate was off on the gas daily curve shift because Monte Lost connection to Randy's files. This meant that on the estimate, the liquidated day was incorrect.  When I run it, we are much closer (within $20,000), but this is not the # you went home with.  This issue will be resolved tomorrow ensuring that the estimate will be more accurate.  

The next largest item on the reconciliation is the transport model.  There is not one deal that stands out as the culprit.  I need to do some more investigating as to how to improve the transport model estimate.  It may be discounting.  The curves and the spreads are all accurate.


The status of the three items we discussed today are: 

1. I am working away at the new deal model.  Kieth and I are in agreement as to the basic form.
2. I gave you the broker report.; and
3.  Jeff is working with confirmations to get you both the broker confirms and our confirms so that you can sign off on them.
3a. I am also working on the desk to desk physical report.  I was unable to run the report I initially had in mind.  I will let you know.

I am trying very hard to provide the information you need in a timely accurate fashion.  If you have any suggestions as to how Monte and I can improve, please tell me.

See you tomorrow.

Anne

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes were higher on Friday due to bargain hunting buying in
technology stocks. The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday as it continues
to consolidate above the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally
crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling
that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The
March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering ahead of Christmas. Bulls remain encouraged by this week's
short covering rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's
rally crossing at 1120.66. However, closes above December's high
crossing at 1176 are needed to renew this fall's rally. Until then,
March may decide to correct more in time than price, which would be
long-term bullish.

The Dow posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday due to
light bargain hunting buying ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend.
Gains were limited following a downward revision of the third quarter
GDP to -1.3% from the previous estimate of -1.1%. Additional pressure
came from weak consumer confidence data. Nevertheless, the Dow
remains poised to test the 62% retracement level of the May/September
decline crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the Christmas holiday. A downward revision in economic growth for
the third quarter along with weak consumer spending also provided
light pressure to the market. Nevertheless, March remained above this
fall's downtrend line, which leaves the door open for sideways to
higher prices possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI
remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
near-term. Closes above last week's high crossing at 102-05 would
confirm this week's trendline breakout while opening the door for a
larger-degree rebound this winter. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to strength in livestock,
precious metals, fiber, and energies. Stochastics and the RSI are
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible
into the end of the year. Today's rally sets the stage for a possible
test of this month's high crossing at 193.39. Closes above 193.39 are
needed to renew the CRB's rally off October's low. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed mostly higher on Friday with the exception
of heating oil. Trading volume was limited as many traders decided to
kick off the Christmas holiday early. Trading next week is likely to
be subdued ahead of next Friday's meeting among OPEC nations at which
time they will decide whether or not to proceed with their announced
cutback on crude oil production beginning January 1 in an attempt to
stabilize sagging energy prices. 

February crude oil posted an inside day with a higher close due to
light short covering on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursday's
losses. February has broken out above this fall's downtrend line
leaving it in position to test the early-December high crossing at
21.05 later this winter. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of
next week's OPEC meeting. 

February heating oil closed slightly lower on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's key reversal down. I would not be surprised to
see sideways trading extend into the end of the year as traders await
OPEC's decision about production next Friday. Closes above this
week's high would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into
early-January with November's high crossing at 64.35 being a
potential target later this winter. 

February unleaded gas closed slightly higher due to light short
covering on Friday. This week's failed attempt to breakout the
early-December high of 57.62 has left a possible double top on the
daily chart. Closes above this resistance level would open the door
for a possible test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 later this
winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into the end of the year.

February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply higher on Friday as
extended weather forecasts are calling for the first major winter
storm of the winter to hit portions of the upper Midwest and move
eastward beginning this weekend. Today's high fell short of testing
last week's high crossing at 2.94. Closes above this resistance level
would confirm a breakout above this fall's downtrend line while
opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar closed sharply higher on Friday and posted a hew
high close for December. Short covering ahead of the Christmas
holiday triggered today's rally. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish
signaling that additional gains are possible. While a round of profit
taking is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set
for additional gains into early-January. I am looking for the March
Dollar to eventually try and test November's high crossing at 118.27
later this winter. 

The March Swiss Franc closed sharply lower on Friday thereby turning
short-term momentum indicators bearish signaling that a short-term
top has been posted. The nearly flat correction off November's low
was one of time instead of price and underscores the weak tone of the
market. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading
resumes next week, the stage is set for a possible test of this
fall's lows by early-January. 

The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Friday and tested the 62%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6300. While a
short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week,
momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are possible into early-January. If the decline continues, the
75% retracement level crossing at .6273 is March's next target. 

The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Friday as it
fell to a new three-year low against the U.S. Dollar. The late-week
acceleration in this fall's decline leaves the market poised to
eventually test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 later this
winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness
is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near
.7970 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken
place.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold closed higher on Friday due to short covering triggered
by today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar. As long as February gold
remains above minor trendline support crossing near 276.50 the door
remains open for sideways to higher prices into early January with
November's high crossing at 283.30 being a potential target.
Stochastics and the RSI are holding onto their bullish positions
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-
January. 

March silver closed sharply higher on Thursday due in large part
year-end short covering. Nevertheless, today's rally led to a close
above the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423 thereby renewing
its rally off November's low. While stochastics and the RSI are very
overbought, trend-following indicators such as the ADX are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. 

March copper closed higher on Friday after testing the 50%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. March's
inability to push below this support level triggered a short covering
rally into the close. However, additional strength next week with
closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to
confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are
oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into the end of the year. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed lower on Friday falling just a 1/4-cent short of
testing the contract low posted in November. Closes below the
contract low at 2.10 1/4 would open the door for additional weakness
and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this
winter. Uncertainty over sales policies in Argentina and China along
with lagging U.S. export sales, which are running 11% behind last
year's sluggish pace continue to pressure the market. Today's sharp
rally in the U.S. Dollar along with an increase in cheaper feed-grade
wheat also pressured the market. Short-term momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the
end of December. 

March wheat closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead
of the Christmas holiday. Light support came from expectations that
this week's huge U.S. wheat sale to China will be confirmed before
the end of the year. At the same time gains were limited due to ideas
that Argentina will soon devalue its currency and that wheat exports
will pick up significantly once this devaluation occurs. Since wheat
is on pace to meet USDA export sales, any further sales to China
could be extremely supportive to wheat prices as ending stocks will
be directly effected. It will take closes above the Nov./Dec.
downtrend line crossing near 2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in
the market. Until then look for choppy price action to continue. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed steady on Friday in quiet pre- holiday type
trading. I do not see any major pickup in trading volume when traders
return from Christmas next week. While demand for U.S. beans remains
strong, near ideal growing condition in South America have bears
penciling in another record soybean crop. Uncertainty about
Argentina's political situation is also limiting near-term gains as
they are expected to devalue their currency in the near future. Once
this is done, they will likely become aggressive marketers of new
crop soybeans once they become available to the market. At the same
time, momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral hinting
that a short-term bottom might be in or is near. Closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 4.41 are needed to confirm a
bottom is in place.

January soybean meal closed lower on Friday. Early strength led to a
spike above minor resistance crossing at 151.90. However, a lack of
follow-through buying triggered a sell off ahead of the close.
Nevertheless, short-term momentum indicators have turned bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs gapped up and closed sharply higher following
Thursday's friendly monthly cold storage report confirming Thursday's
upside reversal. Spillover support from sharply higher belly and
cattle prices also underpinned today's rally. Talk of steady cash
bids next week could support steady to higher prices on Monday
however, trading volume will be very thin leaving the door open for
volatile trading. Today's gap up may prove to be an upside breakaway
gap. While a setback is possible on Monday, the stage is set for a
test of November's high crossing at 55.35 later this winter. Momentum
indicators are higher signaling that additional gains are possible
into early-January. 

February cattle closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering
ahead of this afternoon's cattle-on-feed report. The report was
called bullish for the April and June contracts because of the
less-than-expected placements. Today's new high close for the week
following by a friendly cattle-on-feed report sets the stage for a
possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 later this winter.
Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible into early-January. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key
reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and
funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday
trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a
breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a
possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later
this winter. 

March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on
Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap crossing
at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's
setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in
place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing at
1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door
for a larger-degree decline into January. 

March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on Friday as
it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's
spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing
at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March
to renew this week's decline next week with November's low crossing
at 661 being a possible target later this winter. 

March cotton closed higher on Friday due to light short covering
ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. This week's setback has
turned stochastics and the RSI bearish again signaling that sideways
to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes above
37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in
the market. 

I want to wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. Take
time to find and remember why we are celebrating Christmas. Ken

 	  	 Dear Mike,

Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) says he is unsure whether an energy bill will reach the Senate floor this year. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says Senator Bingaman is also downplaying the chances that a new Republican energy proposal will alter the debate significantly. The bureau will have the latest from the Hill on Friday. 

Also from Washington on Friday, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency Robert Priddle will discuss the world's energy supply within the context of the campaign against terrorism. Priddle is speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies tomorrow, and the Washington bureau will bring us all the details. 

Energy Markets Washington Editor Jack Belcher will join us from the Washington bureau on Friday. Belcher is stopping by during the 
9:00 a.m. ET newscast to discuss the EPA's new boutique fuels proposal. 

The Independent Petroleum Association of America will continue a three-day meeting in Houston on Friday. Interior Secretary 
Gale Norton and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham are among those attending the meeting. Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will have details on the meeting from the Houston bureau on Friday. 

Also from Houston, Spinnaker Exploration CEO and Founder 
Roger Jarvis will discuss his company's third-quarter earnings results. Join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast for the Jarvis interview. And catch Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research 
Mark Meyer as he talks about how oil stocks are doing this quarter. We'll bring you these interviews from Houston on Friday. 

From the West Coast bureau on Friday, ENL's Kym McNicholas will bring us a report on the extra security measures being taken to protect the Hoover Dam. The dam has 17 generators, each capable of supplying electricity to 100,000 households. Catch the Hoover Dam report from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Two days after coach Bill Cowher said Bettis was likely to play Sunday against Detroit, the running back was listed Tuesday as doubtful with a groin injury. ""But this is not a Fred Taylor injury.

me back and play this year. But we've got to be very careful making sure he's playing in the right games."" Keep Bettis on your bench this week. His health status makes him too risky a player. Chris Fuamatu-Ma'afala will likely start for Bettis.</FONT>

""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.'' This development will limit George's production over the final three weeks, making him a risky start.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
McNair will miss Tuesday's practice due to tightness in his lower back which hampered him during Sunday's game against Green Bay. The injury is unrelated to his 1999 surgery to repair a disc in his lower back, and he should return to practice on Wednesday. Provided McNair heals over the next couple of days, he's a safe start for Week 15.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=133462&""><B>Amos Zereoue</B></A>, RB PIT - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Zereoue re-injured his sprained shoulder late in Sunday's game against Baltimore.

</A>, QB DEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Broncos are likely to place Frerotte on injured reserve due to a separated shoulder which might require surgery.

He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=1177&""><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football292.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=3066&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Metz <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Chargers Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he plans to start Flutie Sunday against Kansas City instead of rookie Drew Brees. While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time!

Barber compiled 130 scrimmage yards against Arizona, but he was held out of the end zone. Barber will continue to be a focal point of the Giants' offense, however, and will be a valuable player to have during the Fantasy playoffs. <BR>

Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. <BR>

Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. <BR>

Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. <BR>

Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. <BR>

Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season. <BR>

Subject:	Work Hours

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

"Fw: 20K Race Predictors","Hi Kenyan runners,  here is some useful information concerning the 20k this week end and what pace you should run.
You should run the first 10K at that pace then pick up, if possible, the second 10K.
 
Marine Corps, New York, or San Antonio should use the faster sheet 
All other runners use the slower sheet.  
Thanks
 
Jon/Sean/Jerry

Hi Mike,
 
He was originally, however we were told to take him off as he and his manager agreed  that this round was probably not the right time for him to interview.

"","I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

Phillip:

The target for end of October is 1283. We're not sure what's driving the day to day variation. Direct effects of recent precipitation, combined with some very big precip forecast errors, are part of the explanation, but there also appears to be something going on with management of the non-treaty storage that BPA's cached upstream in Arrow. We've been looking into that, and hope to get some news via Technical Management Team today.

From a multi-purpose project manager's perspective, I think that current reservoir elevation is one or two feet too high, so I do expect drawdown by month end. I also suspect that there are some limits in the non-treaty storage approaching that require at least partial withdrawal.

The net effect should be a rise in production-- no more downstream storage is available and upstream releases will increase, certainly by November 1, but probably earlier.

Tim,

Since the three nuclear units have gone down there has been a significant increase in imports into California from the northwest which coincides with increased hydro output.  This has continued to suppress Socal gas sendouts.    Grand Coulee outflows on Monday and Tuesday have exceeded inflows.  Monday: In-69.8, Out-73.4; Tuesday: In-57.7, Out 68.2.  The elevation is starting to creep lower.

Can you help us with these questions?  Will this drafting to continue?  What is the elevation target for the end of the month?  Why did yesterday's inflow decline so much?

Thank you,

Phillip Allen

Mike,

Sorry, I did not get a chance to say goodbye.  It was kind of crazy the day that they told everyone to leave.

I wish you all of the luck there.  From the paper this morning, it looks like that you will be auctions to the highest bidder.  It is kind of sad.  

I am currently working out of Enron's out placement service in Allen III.  The facilities are pretty nice.  The job market is pretty slow.  It gives me plenty of time to get my yard in shape.  Ha!

Also, I have been spending a lot of time at Rockport.  The next time you go down there in the future, please come by and see our place.  We are on Fulton Beach Road just north of Trailor Inn By The Bay.  You never know, I may be moving there sooner than you think.  Ha!

Take care and good luck always.

Bob

 	  	 Dear Mike,

The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax scare on Capitol Hill on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the decision to shut down the House of Representatives until Tuesday means at least one energy hearing on MTBE will be delayed. The Senate remains in session and we hope to hear from Senators on Thursday about the situation. 

Peter also says the bureau will have more reaction to the news that Department of Energy official Joe Kelliher has been picked by 
President Bush to fill the vacant seat at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Kelliher's name has been on the top of the list for some time, and now the decision is official. 

PSE&G Director of Interregional Transmission Laura Manz will also join us from the Washington bureau on Thursday. Manz has been participating in the FERC RTO workshop, and she'll give us her take on what might come out of the weeklong meetings. Join us during the 
10:00 a.m. ET newscast for the Manz interview. 

IBM Chemical and Petroleum Industry Vice President of Marketing Craig Hodges is penciled in from the Houston bureau on Thursday. IBM has been selected by Shell Oil to create the prototype for a wireless gas station named the e-Station. Catch Hodges during the 
noon ET newscast. 

West Coast Bureau Correspondent Kym McNicholas reports, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham will be in California to announce a new public-private partnership regarding ""Path 15,"" a transmission bottleneck in California. Abraham will also give a keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's Electricity. 

Also from the West Coast bureau on Thursday, Kym talks with a Spokesperson about the Valero refinery's plan to build one power plant to operate the refinery and one to sell energy to off-site customers. The California Energy Commission is expected to decide Wednesday night whether to grant the Valero refinery, located in Benicia, a permit to build. 

From the NASDAQ in New York, NYMEX President Robert Collins will join us. He'll discuss the status of NYMEX operations and trading following the September 11th attacks during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=4>Latest NFL Player News</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1264&""><B>Jeff Graham</B></A>, WR SD - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half. Expect him to be a solid No. 1 QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=146325&""><B>Jeff Garcia</B></A>, QB SF - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=1174&""><B>Eddie George</B></A>, RB TEN - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>George played in Saturday's game despite suffering from an ankle injury.

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gadsden did not play in Saturday's game against the Patriots because of a hamstring injury. Chris Chambers started in his absence.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12207&""><B>Fred Beasley</B></A>, RB SF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Beasley broke his right hand.

He is a must-start player during the final weeks of the NFL season. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

, QB OAK - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon has been a top-flight Fantasy QB this year. He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=641&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts.

Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Wayne is healthy again, and showing signs of improvement.

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed down $0.32 at $67.10

today. The weak U.S. stock market amid the growing anthrax scare
pressured futures today. News that an IBP packing plant in Lexington,
Nebraska, is closing due to present market conditions also pressured
the futures. Prices did open stronger, but could not hold their
gains. 

December lean hogs closed up $0.15 today at $50.37. Short covering
from perceived oversold conditions gave a slight lift to futures
today, as did a more stable cash market today. Still, the bulls are
sickly in this market. Recent heavy hog runs have bulls worried about
burdensome near-term pork supplies. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1 cent higher at $2.07 3/4
today. The market was supported by firming

basis levels in the cash market and the rally in wheat. Prices scored
an ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today. If there is
follow-through buying interest on Thursday, a bullish key reversal
will be confirmed. 

November soybeans closed 3 1/2 cents higher at $4.34 today. The rally
in wheat and rumored Chinese soybean demand supported beans today.
Prices scored an ""outside day"" up on the daily bar chart today. If
there is follow-through buying on Thursday, a bullish key reversal up
will be confirmed. Let's see what the weekly USDA export sales data
shows Thursday morning. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed up 7 cents at $2.84 3/4 today. It
was a big day for the bulls. Prices were boosted by more short
covering, as well as hopes for near-term fresh export demand. Prices
pushed to a fresh seven-week high today and closed near the session
high. 

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 1 point higher at 6.63 cents today.
Prices today pushed to a fresh two-week high, but then backed off and
closed near the session low. The bulls have seen a nice mini run
since the lows scored a little over a week ago. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 85 points higher at 44.75 cents today.
Prices gapped higher on the daily bar chart on some short covering
after prices set a contract low Tuesday. Bulls should not get too
excited about today's gap-higher trade. Let's see what price action
does Thursday and Friday. Nearby coffee futures prices this week set
a record low. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $27 higher today, at $1,066. Prices today
showed good follow-through buying strength

and a bullish key reversal up was confirmed on the daily

bar chart. Bulls are gaining momentum. 

December cotton closed 6 points higher at 31.53 cents in quiet
trading today. I do look for some more short covering in the coming
sessions, but make no mistake: bears

are in command. For a longer-term perspective, nearby New York cotton
futures sunk to a low of 29.50 cents in 1986. 

November orange juice on Tuesday afternoon closed at 86.10. That's
off 1.30 cents from the Monday evening close. Prices are due for some
corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. Last week's USDA
Florida orange figure was termed bullish. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.10 today at $284.00
an ounce. It was another quiet day today. Bulls are trying to
stabilize the market after last week's sell off. Bulls need to show
more strength this week as bears have gained momentum. 

December silver futures closed $0.015 higher at $4.37 an ounce today.
Prices hit a fresh four-week low Tuesday as bears still have the
near-term edge. Silver has also suffered technical damage recently. 

December N.Y. copper closed 50 points lower at 63.90 cents. Prices
today did not show the follow-through buying to confirm a key
reversal up. Prices need to push above 66 cents and see a couple
closes above that level before the bulls get much confidence. 

ENERGIES: December crude closed off $0.16 at $22.10 today. Prices
dropped to a fresh four-week low today. Bears are gaining momentum. A
big bear flag continues to form on the daily chart. If there is a
downside breakout from this big bear flag, the measuring implications
point to possible losses to well below $20.00 per barrel. 

December heating oil closed off 53 points, at .6290 today. Prices hit
another fresh four-week low today. Bears remain in control as it
looks like a big bear flag is forming on the daily bar chart.
Measuring implications from this potential bear flag point to much
larger losses. 

December unleaded gasoline closed 99 points lower at .5863 today.
Prices scored a fresh yearly low today, as bears gain even more
momentum. Expect more volatility in the coming weeks. 

December natural gas closed $0.0149 lower at $2.703 today. Prices
pushed to another fresh five-week high today but then closed near the
session low. Bulls have gained just a bit of momentum, but bears have
the overall advantage.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 47
points lower today at .9010. Today's close was the lowest closing
price in over a month. Bears are

gaining confidence. Prices are presently trading below a
five-week-old downtrend line drawn off the September and October
highs. 

The December Japanese yen closed up 6 points at .8283 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of
the yen. A steep four- week-old downtrend line is in place on the
daily bar chart. 

The December Swiss franc closed 19 points lower at .6101 today. While
a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily bar
chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar
chart remains intact. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 25 points lower at .6363 today.
Prices again closed near the session low. Bulls need to step up the
rest of this week or they will lose the slight momentum they have
recently gained. Prices are still in a three-month-old downtrend on
the daily bar chart. 

The December British pound closed 6 points lower at 1.4424. It was
another quiet day today. Bears have the slight edge. Technical damage
has been inflicted recently.

First support is seen at the 1.4344 level. First resistance is now
seen at 1.4500. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 56 points higher at 114.78
today. Bulls have made progress recently, but need

to keep the pressure on the bears. It appears a head-and- shoulders
bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 17/32 higher at 106 23/32. Bulls are
having a very good week, so far, and they needed it. Bulls can
correctly argue this market was due for some corrective
consolidation. The charts are still favoring the bulls. 

December S&P 500 futures closed off 23.50 at 1076.00. Today, prices
scored a bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar chart, and if
there is follow-through selling on Thursday, a bearish key reversal
down will be confirmed. Still, not much technical damage occurred
today. Let's see what happens Thursday and Friday. This index has
shown resilience, despite the gloomy U.S. economic conditions and
terrorist threats. The growing anthrax

scare did spook traders today.

Mike the exact path and name of the Financial Curve File is:

It would be better for us if you would set the financial index curves in this file, just like you do the Physical index curves in the other file.  Let me know what you decide.

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" 

Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - P! in! k Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1296&>, WR DEN - TexOK Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard run, but the Bro! nc! os let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1253&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1204&>, WR SD - McKay Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1843&>, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Jones overca! me! a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Upd! at! ed 10/28/01 
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187382&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Dolphins! h! eld Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He remains a must-start Fantasy player, no matte! r ! what the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1440&>, RB WAS - TexOK Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Sunday at Ph! il! adelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=45! 03! &key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=8&>, DT DAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a score in ! Su! nday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4503&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

"Sunday 12/18/01 WX 4KZ","Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

<p><b>Congress is out of town</b>, but we've still got plenty of energy
news from Washington.  The <b>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
meets</b> on Tuesday.  One of the issues on the FERC's agenda is a
<b>complaint filed against the California Independent System
Operator</b>.  Some companies allege the ISO is giving the California
Department of Water Resources preferential market treatment in its new
role as California's main power purchaser.  We'll bring you the latest
from the FERC on Tuesday. 
<p>ENL's Washington bureau will also cover the <b>release of the North

<b>Department of Energy's Clean Coal Technology Conference</b> in
Washington.  The event focuses on the <b>latest in clean coal
innovation</b> and the prospects for coal-fired generation in the U.S.
<p>Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante reports, many companies feel
<b>wild price swings could be eliminated with more accurate weather
predictions</b>.  On Tuesday, Kim talks with <b>Reliant Energy</b> about
steps that can be taken to minimize weather risks.
<p><b>Ivanhoe Energy Vice President of Investor Relations John
MacDonald</b> talks with our Houston bureau about plans his company has
for <b>Gas-to-Liquids production</b>.  This type of motor fuel is
odorless and emissions-free.  We'll have more from MacDonald on Tuesday.

<p>From the NASDAQ on Tuesday, <b>ESAI Power and Gas Services Director
Edward Kraples</b> will join us.  During the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast,
he'll talk about the amount of <b>investment needed to keep Northwest
power prices from escalating</b>.
<p>Broadcasting Note: Thanksgiving is this Thursday and the ENL staff is
preparing the turkey.  The markets are <b>closed Thursday and Friday, so
we'll be dark</b>.  
<p>Wrap Note: In response to many viewer requests, starting today we're
going to <b>add some of the day's commodity settles</b>.  We hope you'll

Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday.  ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive.     </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=253&key=1160&""><B>Lamar Smith</B></A>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith carried nine times for only 22 yards at San Francisco.

Mike,

I have just made slight changes, however if you/patti could cite examples of non performance on certain projects/tasks that have highlighted the need for her to improve in the areas of initiative/bus skills/org skills etc.. that would be great.   Following your additions, I will send to legal (who usually will make other changes/suggestions).

Kind regards, Karen.

He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last two games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=187741&""><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichick announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe to a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady might have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fairly safe weekly starter otherwise.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=15&""><B> Dolphins</B></A>, DT MIA - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the season due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's absence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks.</FONT></FON!

He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=1032&""><B>Mark Brunell</B></A>, QB JAC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Brunell's nagging leg injury might sideline him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours before last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as you set your lineups.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=12753&""><B>Fred Taylor</B></A>, RB JAC - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Taylor received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of the season, according to the <I>Florida Times-Union</I>. The diagnosis was that the injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, and in the meantime Taylor has developed pain!
 i!
n his hip, a side effect of the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again this Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=1220&""><B>Rod Smith</B></A>, WR DEN - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss Thursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravated it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Broncos' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it would be prior to the season.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

He should roll up some fine numbers against the Chiefs this week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2125&key=187741&""><B>Tom Brady</B></A>, QB NE - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/20/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Patriots will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No. 2 QB. ""I don't see any changes this week,"" coach Bill Belichick said. Brady is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to you!

.

""Doug is going to be our quarterback,"" he said. ""You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes were lower on Thursday due to a number of earnings
warnings among high-tech companies. Additional pressure was due to
profit taking ahead of the Christmas holiday. The NASDAQ closed
sharply lower on Thursday and below last week's low of 1934.60 and is
poised to test the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally
crossing at 1905.53 possibly on Friday. Momentum indicators remain
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into
early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed lower on Thursday
due to light profit taking triggered by a number of earnings warnings
and Congresses inability to pass an economic stimulus package before
Christmas. Bulls were encouraged as March remained within Wednesday's
trading range thereby leaving the door open for additional short
covering possibly into the end of the year. 

The Dow posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday due to
light profit taking ahead of the Christmas Day holiday. Additional
pressure came from a earnings and revenue warning from Juniper
Networks causing some concern over the recent rally in technology
stocks. News that Congress will not likely pass an economic stimulus
package also weighed on prices. Losses were limited as the latest
jobless claims report showed a decline of 11,000 claims to 384,000. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds closed slightly lower on Thursday but ended above
trendline resistance drawn across the Nov./Dec. highs, which crosses
near 101-05. Multiple closes above this downtrend line and broken
support crossing at 101-22 are needed to confirm today's trendline
breakout. Support came from the latest jobless claims report, which
showed a decline of 11,000 to 384,000. Momentum indicators have
turned bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
into the end of the year. I would not be surprised to see subdued
trading on Friday as many traders will have already left to celebrate
Christmas early. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed modestly higher on Thursday due to strength in
hogs, precious metals, some foods, and natural gas. Today's rebound
ended a two-day sell off from Monday's high. However, the mid-range
close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Closes
above 193.39 or below 187.73 are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the
end of the year.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed lower on Thursday with the exception of
natural gas. Today's weakness appears to be due to profit taking
ahead of Christmas, as many traders will start the weekend early
taking Friday off. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of
OPEC's upcoming meeting next week when they will decide whether or
not to go ahead with their announce production cut of 1.5 million
barrels per day. Non- OPEC countries combined cuts are fast
approaching the 500,000 barrel per day production cut needed for OPEC
to enact their own cuts. 

February crude oil posted a key reversal down on Thursday due to
light profit taking. Early strength failed to exceed Wednesday's high
of 20.18, which triggered the sell off into the close. Additional
weakness on Friday would confirm today's bearish reversal pattern
that could lead to a test of recent lows crossing at 18.20. Trading
is likely to remain subdued ahead of next week's OPEC meeting. 

February heating oil posted a key reversal down on Thursday after a
spike above the early-December high crossing at 57.85 failed to
attract additional buying. The low-range close on Thursday sets the
stage for follow-through selling due to light profit taking ahead of
Christmas on Friday. Trading volume will be low as many traders are
expected to start the Christmas weekend on Friday. A lower close on
Friday would signal that a double top may have been posted with
today's high. 

February unleaded gas also posted a key reversal down on Thursday due
to profit taking after spiking above the early- December high of
57.62. Early strength failed to trigger new buying so traders dumped
their long positions ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend.
Additional weakness on Friday would turn the near-term trend sideways
ahead of next week's much anticipated OPEC meeting. 

February Henry Hub natural gas closed higher due to short covering on
Thursday despite Wednesday's slightly negative AGA weekly inventory
report. The report showed a draw of 44 billion cubic feet from U.S.
stocks last week, which was below expectations, due in part to above
normal temps across large portions of high demand regions of the
country and continued weakness from industry. Closes above 2.94 or
below December's low at 2.58 are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar closed higher on Thursday but near session lows due
to a late round of profit taking. Early strength tested last week's
gap beginning at 11.46 before buying dried up. The low-range close
leaves the door open for additional profit taking ahead of Christmas
on Friday. Closes above gap resistance crossing at 116.55 would
signal that a larger-degree rebound is possible into January.
Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish signaling that additional
gains are possible. 

The March Swiss Franc closed higher on Thursday due to light short
covering. Closes above Monday's high at .6154 are needed to renew
March's rebound off December's low. At the same time stochastics and
the RSI are nearing their respective overbought zones hinting that a
test of November's high crossing at .6182 is possible however, time
is no longer on their side. If this resistance level is tested in the
near-future, it would likely mark a short-term top, defining the
upper boundary of this winter's trading range. 

The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Thursday and below the 38%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6342. Today's
decline sets the stage for a likely test of December's reaction low
crossing at .6325 possibly before the end of the year. Momentum
indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are possible into early-January. 

The March Japanese Yen continues to decline off November's high and
remains poised to eventually test monthly fib support crossing at
.7568 later this winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend
line crossing near .7972 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend
change has taken place.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold posted a quiet inside day with a higher close on
Thursday due to short covering as it consolidated some of Wednesday's
loss. While another day or two of consolidation above Wednesday's low
is possible, stochastics and the RSI have turned neutral to bearish
signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into
early-January. Closes above 283.30 or below 271.70 are needed to
clear up near-term direction in the market. 

March silver closed higher on Thursday leaving Wednesday's key
reversal down unconfirmed. Today's rebound leaves March poised to
test the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to keep the rally off November's low
alive. At the same time, stochastics and the RSI are very overbought
warning traders to use caution as a short-term top appears to be in
or is near.

March copper closed higher on Thursday as it continues to consolidate
above the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50
and above December's broken downtrend line. Short-term momentum
indicators are oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. If
this month's decline resumes, the 62% retracement level crossing at
66.04 is a potential target.

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed lower on Thursday following this morning's
disappointing export sales report, which showed net sales of only
23.7 million bushels. Additional pressure came from uncertainty over
China's grain policies and conflicting data regarding their ending
stocks level. Trading volume continues to dry up ahead of the
extended Christmas Holiday weekend, which leaves the market
vulnerable to test its contract low at 2.10 1/4 on Friday.
Stochastics and the RSI remain bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are still possible into early-January. Closes below the
contract low would open the door for a possible test of weekly
support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this winter. 

March wheat closed sharply lower on Thursday erasing almost all of
Wednesday's gains. The reason for today's sell off was a lack of
confirmation about Wednesday's announced sale to China. Additional
pressure was triggered when Cargill was a featured seller of wheat
today. This week's back and fill type trading is often typical ahead
of the Christmas Holiday and the end of the year due to reduced
trading volume. While momentum indicators remain bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year,
it will take closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near
2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in the market. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed fractionally higher on Thursday following
another strong weekly export sales report. The report showed net
soybean sales of 36.6 million bushels. However, gains were limited
due to weakness in corn and wheat. While demand remains strong for
U.S. soybeans, the market is becoming increasingly concerned that
South American supplies will soon cut in to U.S. export business.
Without any major weather problems down south, I am looking for
soybeans to continue to drift sideways to lower into January.

January soybean meal closed higher on Thursday following another
strong weekly export sales report. The report showed net sales of
142,400 metric tonnes. Closes above last Friday's high crossing at
151.90 would temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market.
Stochastics and the RSI are diverging and have turned bullish with
today's rally hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible
into the end of the year.

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs posted an upside reversal on Thursday hinting that the
setback off Monday's high might have come to an end. A higher close
on Friday is needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern.
Today's rally was triggered by talk that packers could raise their
cash bids on Friday to fill their needs for what could be a large
Saturday kill. Today's rally was limited ahead of this afternoon's
monthly cold storage report. The report showed 36.290 million pounds
of bellies in storage as of Nov. 30th, which is below pre- report
estimates. Early calls are for steady to higher hogs on Friday and
higher belly prices following today's friendly cold storage report. 

February cattle closed lower on Thursday as news of $62 cash trade in
Kansas pressured the market lower. Thursday's decline ate into
Tuesday's rally as traders are positioning themselves ahead of
Friday's cattle-on-feed report. Momentum indicators remain bullish
but will need to see renewed strength soon or risk rolling over into
bearish modes when trading resumes next week. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed into new highs for the month on Thursday thereby
renewing this month's short covering rally. Session highs filled
November's gap at 49.60 thereby opening the door for a larger-degree
rebound into January. Today's rally was due to year-end short
covering by funds and small speculators. Light support came from news
that the Central American harvest remains slow and part of that
coffee crop will go unpicked due to current low prices. Stochastics
and the RSI remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
are possible into the end of the year. November's high crossing at
53.00 is March's next target. 

March cocoa closed lower on Thursday in relatively quiet trading
following Wednesday's gap down and lower close. Momentum indicators
have turned bearish with this week's setback thereby increasing the
odds that a short-term top is in place. Today's mid-range close
leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday. Closes below
last week's low crossing at 1212 would open the door for a
larger-degree decline into January. 

March sugar closed higher on Thursday due to light short covering
following Wednesday's close below the 50% retracement level of this
fall's rally crossing at 698. However, buying dried up late in the
session, which led to a mid-range close. Sideways trading is possible
on Friday however, momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am
looking for March to try and test November's low at 661 later this
winter. 

March cotton posted an inside day with a lower close on Thursday
following a disappointing export sales report. Traders were looking
for export sales to range from 200,000 to 250,000 bales. However, the
report came in showing sales of only 169,900 bales. Fallout from
Wednesday's upward revised Chinese crop estimate also weighed on
prices. This week's setback has turned stochastics and the RSI
bearish again signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible
into the end of the year. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are
needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes were higher on Wednesday due to strength in technology
stocks. However, light profit taking ahead of the close tempered some
of today's gains leaving the door open for sideways trading on
Thursday. The NASDAQ remains above the 25% retracement level of this
fall's rally crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish
signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into
early-January. The March S&P 500 index also closed higher on
Wednesday but ended the day near mid-range, which leaves the door
open for sideways trading on Thursday. March continues to rebound off
the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing at 1120.66.
However, closes above December's high crossing at 1176 are needed to
renew this fall's rally. Until then, March may decide to correct more
in time than price, which would be long-term bullish.

The Dow closed higher on Wednesday as better-than-expected holiday
retail sales from Wal-Mart and Yahoo! Underpinned today's rally. Tech
stocks found light support as investors bought on the hope that this
sector and the economy would benefit from consumer's willingness to
buy. Wal-Mart stock rose $1.11 per share to $58.24. Yahoo! Also rose
by $1.13 to $17.80 after the online company reported holiday sales
rose by 86% from the previous year. The Dow fell just short of
testing its early December high of 10,169.40. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to renew this fall's rally. The Dow
closed just below the 62% retracement level of the May/September
decline crossing at 10,094.10 at 10,088. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds closed lower on Wednesday due to strength in the equity
markets. March opened lower and extended losses throughout the
session as it extended its setback off last week's high, which spiked
above this fall's downtrend line. Until March bonds close above
December's reaction high crossing at 102-05, the near-term trend will
remain sideways possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI
are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
near-term. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed sharply higher on Wednesday due to strength in
cattle, precious metals, fiber, and energies. Today's new high close
for December has set the stage for a possible test of the 25%
retracement level of this year's decline crossing at 194.76. Closes
above this resistance level and this year's downtrend line crossing
near 195.35 are needed to confirm that a major bottom and trend
change has taken place. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices are possible into the early-January. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed sharply higher on Wednesday, as OPEC
appears more certain of announcing on Friday an output cut of 2
million barrels of crude oil per day beginning January 1.

February crude oil closed sharply higher on Wednesday and above the
previous reaction high crossing at 21.05 thereby opening the door for
a larger-degree rebound into January. Session highs fell short of
testing the 38% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing at
21.77. If this resistance level is cleared, November's high crossing
at 22.83 is a possible target in early-January. Stochastics and the
RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
near-term. 

February heating oil closed into new highs for December on Wednesday
thereby negating the possibility that last week's high marked a
double top. Wednesday's high-range close opens the door for
additional gains into early-January with November's reaction high
crossing at 64.35 being the next likely upside target. Stochastics
and the RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are
possible near- term. 

February unleaded gas soared to new highs for December as they
exceeded minor resistance crossing at 57.90 and filled November's gap
at 59.80. Today's high-range close sets the stage for follow-through
buying on Thursday. If the rally continues, November's high crossing
at 62.31 is February's next target. Momentum indicators are becoming
overbought but remain bullish signaling that additional gains are
possible into early-January.

February Henry Hub natural gas closed slightly higher on Wednesday
thereby confirming last Friday's breakout above this fall's downtrend
line. Extended weather forecasts are calling for below normal temps
to persist across the Midwest and eastward through the weekend before
a small warm up is possible. Unless there is an extended period of
time of below normal temps across high demand regions of the country,
upside potential remains limited due to the abundant supplies of
natural gas in storage. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. If the rebound continues, November's reaction high
crossing at 3.165 is February's next target. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar closed slightly lower on Wednesday due to light
profit taking as it consolidated some of Monday's gains.
Nevertheless, March remained above broken resistance marked by
November's high, which crosses at 118.27. If the rally continues, the
75% retracement level of this summer's decline crossing at 119.57 is
March's next upside target. Trend-following indicators such as the
ADX are entering bullish trend modes signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into early-January. 

The March Swiss Franc closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to
light short covering after spiking below September's low crossing at
.5860 in early trading. Today's high-range close leaves the door open
for additional short covering on Thursday. However, the recent
breakout below this fall's trading range has opened the door for
sideways to lower prices into early-January. If the decline
continues, fib support crossing at .5722 is March's next target. 

The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday and below the 75%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6273. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible into early-January. If the decline continues, November's low
crossing at .6230 is March's next target. 

The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Wednesday as
it continues to accelerate towards monthly fib support crossing at
.7568. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness is
possible into early- January.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold closed higher on Wednesday as it extended its rebound
off last week's low. Closes above last week's high crossing at 281.40
are needed to renew February's rebound off December's low. Closes
above November's high crossing at 283.30 would open the door for a
larger-degree rebound as the new year begins. Stochastics and the RSI
are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
into early-January. 

March silver closed slightly lower on Wednesday due light profit
taking as it consolidated some of its recent gains. If the rally
continues, the 62% retracement level of this fall's decline crossing
at 4.51 is March's next target. Stochastics and the RSI are very
overbought however, the ADX is bullish signaling that additional
gains are possible into early-January. 

March copper closed higher on Wednesday as it extended last Friday's
rebound off the 50% retracement level of November's rally crossing at
67.50. Closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to
confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are
turning bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
into the end of the year. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed lower on Wednesday as they broke out below
November's low at 2.10 1/4 to post a new contract low. While a short
covering bounce is possible on Thursday, the door has been opened for
a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this
winter. Short-term momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. Today's
sell off was triggered from increased fears that Argentina will be an
aggressive seller of wheat and corn early next year due to their
precarious economic and political situation. Additional pressure came
from uncertainty over China's corn supply situation, which paints a
bearish picture for U.S. corn exports.

March wheat closed lower on Wednesday due to fund selling. Spillover
weakness from corn and soybeans along with lackluster wheat export
shipments weighed on prices throughout the day. March wheat is
challenging minor trendline support drawn across this month's lows,
which crosses near 2.83. Closes below this support level would open
the door for a test of December's low crossing at 2.77 and then this
fall's low at 2.73 later this winter. While there was some talk about
a lack of snow cover across the Plains, which could lead to possible
winter kill, temps would have to remain below normal for a few weeks
before these concerns are taken seriously by the market. Today's
decline turned stochastics and the RSI bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are likely into early-January. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed sharply lower on Wednesday, as South American
weather is not considered a major threat to big crops at this point
in time. Additional pressure came from political and economic
uncertainty in Argentina. Trading volume was light today as it did
not take much selling to push the market sharply lower on the day.
The low-range close leaves the door open for additional selling on
Thursday. Closes below this fall's low crossing at 4.26 1/4 would
renew the larger-degree downtrend while opening the door for a
possible test of weekly support crossing at 4.17 1/2 later this
winter. 

January soybean meal closed lower on Wednesday thereby confirming
last Friday's downside reversal. Today's sell off was somewhat of a
surprise to the market given the below normal temps, which have moved
across the Midwest since the weekend. Extended weather forecasts are
calling for below- normal temps to continue for the next 10-days.
Despite this bullish weather forecast, Wednesday's low-range close
sets the stage for follow-through weakness on Thursday. Closes below
December's low crossing at 147.60 would renew this fall's decline
while opening the door for a possible test of May's low crossing at
146. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs closed lower on Wednesday due to light profit taking as
it consolidated some of its recent gains. Today's round of profit
taking may continue into Friday's quarterly hogs and pigs report due
out Friday after the close. Pre- report estimates are as follows. 

All hogs and pigs 99.9% (range 98.9-101%)

Kept for breading 99.3% (range 98.5-101.5%)

Kept for marketing 100.1% (range 99-101%)

Trading is likely to remain subdued on Thursday with cash bids called
steady to firmer. Multiple closes above this summer's downtrend line
crossing near 56.40 are needed to keep February's rally off
December's low alive. Stochastics remain bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into early-January. 

February cattle closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to a
late-session rally triggered by hopes for higher cash bids later this
week. Additional support came from expectations that this week's
Showlists would be lighter than last week. Gains were limited due to
futures premium to the cash market. Momentum indicators remain
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. If the rally off December's low continues, this fall's
high crossing at 73.50 is a potential target later this winter. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

The coffee market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's
trade. March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key
reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and
funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday
trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a
breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a
possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents later
this winter. 

The cocoa market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's
trade. March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher
close on Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap
crossing at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this
week's setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is
in place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing
at 1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door
for a larger-degree decline into January. 

The sugar market was closed today. Here is a recap of last Friday's
trade. March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on
Friday as it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this
week's spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally
crossing at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. I am
looking for March to renew this week's decline next week with
November's low crossing at 661 being a possible target later this
winter. 

March cotton closed modestly higher on Wednesday due to light
speculator buying however, trading volume was thin and is expected to
be that weigh for the balance of the week. Stochastics and the RSI
are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are
possible into early January. Closes above 37.60 or below 34.91 are
needed to clear up near-term direction in the market.

Enron Falls Amid Concern Debt Threatens Dynegy Bid (Update2)
By Stacie Babula 
Houston, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003, suggesting a takeover by Dynegy Inc. may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy. 
Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 13 percent, to $7.89 in late morning trading. Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said. 
Enron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive. 
``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold' and doesn't own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.'' 
Dynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy's offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show. 
``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is unknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said. 
SEC Filing 
Last week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core'' businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific. 
Enron wouldn't comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission. 
Most of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing. 
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares. 
``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.'' 
Enron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million. 
A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing. 
Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments. 
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. 
Fourth Quarter 
Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said. 
ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. 
Shares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston. 
Enron's Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year.

"All-Employee Meeting","I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Greater hopes for a speedy turnaround in the U.S. economy 
helped Equities and the U.S. Dollar advance during a week 
cut short by America's Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average closed at 9,959.71, up 125.03, on Friday 
and traders will be watching to see if it can climb above 
the psychologically-important 10,000 mark. In a quiet 
commodities sector, short-covering and firm cash markets 
propelled Cattle and Hog futures higher, while tight 
supplies and supportive technicals boosted Sugar to a nine-
week peak. Grains and Soy products were generally quiet and 
little changed, although Soyoil enjoyed a sharp gain. Crude 
Oil sagged amid a standoff on production cuts, while Silver 
continued to lose its shine and dipped to an eight-year low.

"","Mike,
I'm catching rumor that NGI-Malin doesn't have vol curve associated with it, hence Lenhart's VAR is wrong.  This could be a bad, especially since we are short 37bcf.
Can you help?

Hi Aaron,
I may not be able to get to this WestRateSheet until Mid November because I may be taking 2 week family leave starting this wednesday to care for my son.

I apologize for the delay.

 This is the excel sheet that is linked to EOL Listen or we would like to be linked to EOL Listen that hopefully we can make a web page out of so that it can be posted on the plasma screen.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Redskins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, h! ow! ever, so don't consider him Fantasy-wise just yet. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad! i! f at all possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Tori Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Frank Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 

Shawn Jefferson, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

Troy Hambrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&k! ey! =194768&>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Matty Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Russell Updated 10/17/01
Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the li! ne! up Sunday at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. 

Stacey Mack <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Hunter Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1235&>, WR JAC - Neal/McKay Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige0! 1&! owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1230&>, WR JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1032&>, QB JAC - JWillie Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable.! H! e won't be too productive if he does play. Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1222&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy tea! m.! Larry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Giggles Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Travis Henry <http://football222.fantas! y.! sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235216&>, RB BUF - Martin Updated 10/17/01
Henry told the Buffalo News he plans to have minor surgery on both knees after the season. Henry has tendinitis in both knees, but it will not affect him during the regular season.

Jay Riemersma <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1662&>, TE BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Buffalo News says the Bills want to get Riemersma more involved in the offense now that tackles Jonas Jennings and John Fina are healthy again. Riemersma was being asked to block more often early in the year, but he will now become more involved in the passing game.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&! ra! ndom=3347&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/17/01
It is not clear if Pathon (foot) will be able to play this week against the Patriots. Pathon missed Sunday's game against Oakland. Reggie Wayne would start in Pathon's place if he cannot play again.

Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Miami Herald says Ward had his foor placed in a boot because he had a problem with stress protection. The Dolphins do not know when he will return.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/17/01
According to the Dallas Morning Sta! r, Smith could end up splitting more carries with Troy Hambrick in the coming weeks. Head Coach Dave Campo believes the two backs complement each other very well, and that the move will keep Smith fresh for a longer duration on game day. 

Stephen Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12181&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Alexander underwent an MRI on his injured right ankle Monday, which revealed a high sprain. He is expected to miss at least two weeks of action due to the injury, so be sure to reserve him if he is still on your roster. 

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/17/01
Pittman, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's loss to Chicago, is expected to practice on Tuesday. His status for this weekend's game against Kansas City is questionable, but he is expected to play. 
Greg Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1798&>, TE SF - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Clark went through his most extensive workout since undergoing surgery on his right hamstring three weeks ago. ""It was encouraging,"" Clark told the Contra Costa Times. ""I ran (a half mile). I never could do any of that before the last surgery (which removed his semitendonosis tendon). The most I could do was jog two minutes. It's an amazing difference in comparison."" Head Coach Steve Mariucci doesn't know when Clark will be healthy enough to make his season debut, however, but he did rule Clark out for their Oct. 28 game against Chicago.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1140&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Joey Galloway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1286&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1757&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
According to Eagles' coach Andy Reid, Staley will be the starting tailback on Monday night against the N.Y. Giants. However, Staley is expected to split carries with Correll Buckhalter, which will make it tough to play him Fantasy-wsie. 

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/16/01
Warrick is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Bears. He is recovering from a bruised left shoulder.

Germane Crowell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Johnson had his best game of the season, posting eight catches for 140 yards against Tennessee. He's a top-notch wideout Fantasy-wise, and deserves a weekly spot in your starting lineup. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=187503&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/14/01
Canidate replaced the injured Marshall Faulk late in Sunday's game against the N.Y. Giants. If Faulk's knee injury is serious, be sure to put in a waivers request for Canidate as soon as possible. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Culpepper could have his best game of the season on Sunday against Detroit. He's far too valuable to ever place on reserve, so start him with confidence this week. 

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/11/01
Bettis sat out Wednesday's practice to allow a minor knee injury to heal. He is expected to play in Sunday's game and is listed as probable. 

Raiders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01
The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. 

Deuce McAllister <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. ""That was probably the best he's run the whole year,"" Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. ""I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do."" While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Mike Hollis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3347&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01
Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.

 	  	 Dear Mike,

On Wednesday, we'll continue our live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us reports and interviews throughout the day. 

Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says they'll continue to bring us the very latest on energy legislation and how it's progressing. The bureau will also have updates on the anthrax scare in Washington. Congressional office buildings were closed on Tuesday, but there's a possibility some could reopen as soon as Wednesday. 

The Washington bureau will also cover Wednesday's FERC meeting as commissioners meet for the first time since the end of the weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations. Peter says new proposals for developing RTOs in the Northeast and Southeast are among the issues on the FERC's agenda. 

Dyonyx CEO Fred Pratt will talk with the Houston bureau about how companies can make current technologies work better for them. Dyonyx is a privately held information technology and management-consulting firm. Join us for the Pratt interview from the Houston bureau on Wednesday. 

We'll also get a Texas PUC update on Wednesday. ENL's Gale Smith says we'll find out what electric providers are doing to increase security and what the Texas PUC is doing to monitor emergency preparedness in Texas. Be sure to catch all this from the Houston bureau tomorrow. 

California Power Authority Chairman S. David Freeman gives a reflective look back at the state's energy crunch from the West Coast bureau Wednesday. Freeman also talks about how the state plans to stay out of the headlines in the future. 

West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station will go ahead with plans to set off its 49 sirens on Wednesday to make sure warning systems are operational. Kym says they will continue the test despite their concerns of a jittery public in light of recent terrorist attacks. 

Video Library Update: If you happened to miss it, check out ENL's interview with Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D-NM). Sen. Bingaman discussed the status of energy legislation in the Senate and the anthrax threat in Washington. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Elizabeth Shim","Mike,

Just a quick rundown of the problems we encountered with Liz in scheduling. As you know, we started her out scheduling El Paso. After about 7 weeks of training and having her do intraday nominations, we put her in the weekend rotation. The first weekend she worked, it became obvious that she still did not understand physical gas flow. Shannon spent the whole weekend on the phone talking her through any changes that needed to be made. She didn't seem to remember anything that she had been trained on daily for the previous 7 weeks. When I spoke to her on the following Monday, she indicated that she just became confused after someone tried to make a change in the nomination. We continued to work very closely with her to make her understand how physical gas flow works on El Paso. I started receiving some complaints from customers who were very much aware that she didn't understand what she was doing. After several more weeks, Shannon was becoming frustrated with the lack of progress, so I told Shannon to write down step by step every piece of the day to day nomination and renom process. That weekend went much more smoothly because Liz had every step and every scenario drawn out for her. I have since had her scheduling SoCal Ehrenberg while the new people are training and that seems to be working out OK. I think the biggest problem with Liz is an inability to think outside the box. but she is willing to work hard. I hope this helps. 

Patti

 	  	 Dear Mike,

On Monday, the Washington bureau will follow up on the President's new push for energy legislation in Congress. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says on Friday, we heard some of the President's strongest language to date, urging Democrats in the Senate to bring a bill to the floor. 

There are also several energy hearings scheduled in Congress next week, including one on possible new limits on power plant emissions in the Senate and another on MTBE in the House. The hearings are some of the first to be rescheduled since the anthrax scare hit Congress earlier this month. 

RDI Consulting Principal Mark Morey is penciled in from the Washington bureau on Monday. He'll share his insight on where the emissions issue stands on the Hill during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Secretary of Interior Gale Norton was in Houston Friday at the IPAA conference. On Monday Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us more from Secretary Norton on Lease Sale 181 and how drilling in ANWR will create thousands of jobs for Texans. 

Noble Drilling CEO Jim Day will also stop by the Houston bureau to talk about his company's third-quarter earnings. The company reported very good earnings but Day warns that the fourth quarter may not be as good because of a weakening economy. Join us for all the details on Monday. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will speak with Western States Petroleum Association Spokesperson Dave Fogarty next week. Fogarty will discuss California's decision to ban MTBE by December 31, 2002 and whether the state is ready for this move. Catch Fogarty from the West Coast bureau on Wednesday. 

Former Governor Pete Wilson tells Kym he takes responsibility for signing the state's deregulation plan, but adds there were steps Governor Gray Davis could and should have taken to avoid what turned out to be an energy crisis. Kym will have all the details on this story next week. 

Finally from New York, Goldman Sachs Analyst Dave Fleischer will drop by to talk about the gas market during the noon ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. Have a fantastic weekend! 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

"Increased Security at Enron Center","
Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes were higher on Friday due to bargain hunting buying in
technology stocks. The NASDAQ closed higher on Friday as it continues
to consolidate above the 25% retracement level of this fall's rally
crossing at 1905.53. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling
that sideways to lower prices are possible into early-January. The
March S&P 500 index also closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering ahead of Christmas. Bulls remain encouraged by this week's
short covering rebound off the 25% retracement level of this fall's
rally crossing at 1120.66. However, closes above December's high
crossing at 1176 are needed to renew this fall's rally. Until then,
March may decide to correct more in time than price, which would be
long-term bullish.

The Dow posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday due to
light bargain hunting buying ahead of the Christmas holiday weekend.
Gains were limited following a downward revision of the third quarter
GDP to -1.3% from the previous estimate of -1.1%. Additional pressure
came from weak consumer confidence data. Nevertheless, the Dow
remains poised to test the 62% retracement level of the May/September
decline crossing at 10,094.10 in the near future. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the Christmas holiday. A downward revision in economic growth for
the third quarter along with weak consumer spending also provided
light pressure to the market. Nevertheless, March remained above this
fall's downtrend line, which leaves the door open for sideways to
higher prices possibly into early-January. Stochastics and the RSI
remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
near-term. Closes above last week's high crossing at 102-05 would
confirm this week's trendline breakout while opening the door for a
larger-degree rebound this winter. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to strength in livestock,
precious metals, fiber, and energies. Stochastics and the RSI are
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible
into the end of the year. Today's rally sets the stage for a possible
test of this month's high crossing at 193.39. Closes above 193.39 are
needed to renew the CRB's rally off October's low. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed mostly higher on Friday with the exception
of heating oil. Trading volume was limited as many traders decided to
kick off the Christmas holiday early. Trading next week is likely to
be subdued ahead of next Friday's meeting among OPEC nations at which
time they will decide whether or not to proceed with their announced
cutback on crude oil production beginning January 1 in an attempt to
stabilize sagging energy prices. 

February crude oil posted an inside day with a higher close due to
light short covering on Friday as it consolidated some of Thursday's
losses. February has broken out above this fall's downtrend line
leaving it in position to test the early-December high crossing at
21.05 later this winter. Trading is likely to remain subdued ahead of
next week's OPEC meeting. 

February heating oil closed slightly lower on Friday thereby
confirming Thursday's key reversal down. I would not be surprised to
see sideways trading extend into the end of the year as traders await
OPEC's decision about production next Friday. Closes above this
week's high would open the door for a larger-degree rebound into
early-January with November's high crossing at 64.35 being a
potential target later this winter. 

February unleaded gas closed slightly higher due to light short
covering on Friday. This week's failed attempt to breakout the
early-December high of 57.62 has left a possible double top on the
daily chart. Closes above this resistance level would open the door
for a possible test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 later this
winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into the end of the year.

February Henry Hub natural gas closed sharply higher on Friday as
extended weather forecasts are calling for the first major winter
storm of the winter to hit portions of the upper Midwest and move
eastward beginning this weekend. Today's high fell short of testing
last week's high crossing at 2.94. Closes above this resistance level
would confirm a breakout above this fall's downtrend line while
opening the door for a larger-degree rebound into January. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar closed sharply higher on Friday and posted a hew
high close for December. Short covering ahead of the Christmas
holiday triggered today's rally. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish
signaling that additional gains are possible. While a round of profit
taking is possible when trading resumes next week, the stage is set
for additional gains into early-January. I am looking for the March
Dollar to eventually try and test November's high crossing at 118.27
later this winter. 

The March Swiss Franc closed sharply lower on Friday thereby turning
short-term momentum indicators bearish signaling that a short-term
top has been posted. The nearly flat correction off November's low
was one of time instead of price and underscores the weak tone of the
market. While a short covering bounce is possible when trading
resumes next week, the stage is set for a possible test of this
fall's lows by early-January. 

The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Friday and tested the 62%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at .6300. While a
short covering bounce is possible when trading resumes next week,
momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower
prices are possible into early-January. If the decline continues, the
75% retracement level crossing at .6273 is March's next target. 

The March Japanese Yen plunged to new contract lows on Friday as it
fell to a new three-year low against the U.S. Dollar. The late-week
acceleration in this fall's decline leaves the market poised to
eventually test monthly fib support crossing at .7568 later this
winter. The daily ADX is bearish signaling that additional weakness
is possible. Closes above November?s downtrend line crossing near
.7970 are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken
place.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold closed higher on Friday due to short covering triggered
by today's sharp rally in the U.S. Dollar. As long as February gold
remains above minor trendline support crossing near 276.50 the door
remains open for sideways to higher prices into early January with
November's high crossing at 283.30 being a potential target.
Stochastics and the RSI are holding onto their bullish positions
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into early-
January. 

March silver closed sharply higher on Thursday due in large part
year-end short covering. Nevertheless, today's rally led to a close
above the 50% retracement level crossing at 4.423 thereby renewing
its rally off November's low. While stochastics and the RSI are very
overbought, trend-following indicators such as the ADX are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. 

March copper closed higher on Friday after testing the 50%
retracement level of November's rally crossing at 67.50. March's
inability to push below this support level triggered a short covering
rally into the close. However, additional strength next week with
closes above the reaction high crossing at 69.45 are needed to
confirm a bottom has been posted. Short-term momentum indicators are
oversold and turning neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into the end of the year. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed lower on Friday falling just a 1/4-cent short of
testing the contract low posted in November. Closes below the
contract low at 2.10 1/4 would open the door for additional weakness
and a possible test of weekly support crossing at 2.04 1/4 later this
winter. Uncertainty over sales policies in Argentina and China along
with lagging U.S. export sales, which are running 11% behind last
year's sluggish pace continue to pressure the market. Today's sharp
rally in the U.S. Dollar along with an increase in cheaper feed-grade
wheat also pressured the market. Short-term momentum indicators are
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into the
end of December. 

March wheat closed higher on Friday due to light short covering ahead
of the Christmas holiday. Light support came from expectations that
this week's huge U.S. wheat sale to China will be confirmed before
the end of the year. At the same time gains were limited due to ideas
that Argentina will soon devalue its currency and that wheat exports
will pick up significantly once this devaluation occurs. Since wheat
is on pace to meet USDA export sales, any further sales to China
could be extremely supportive to wheat prices as ending stocks will
be directly effected. It will take closes above the Nov./Dec.
downtrend line crossing near 2.95 to temper the bearish outlook in
the market. Until then look for choppy price action to continue. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed steady on Friday in quiet pre- holiday type
trading. I do not see any major pickup in trading volume when traders
return from Christmas next week. While demand for U.S. beans remains
strong, near ideal growing condition in South America have bears
penciling in another record soybean crop. Uncertainty about
Argentina's political situation is also limiting near-term gains as
they are expected to devalue their currency in the near future. Once
this is done, they will likely become aggressive marketers of new
crop soybeans once they become available to the market. At the same
time, momentum indicators are oversold and turning neutral hinting
that a short-term bottom might be in or is near. Closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 4.41 are needed to confirm a
bottom is in place.

January soybean meal closed lower on Friday. Early strength led to a
spike above minor resistance crossing at 151.90. However, a lack of
follow-through buying triggered a sell off ahead of the close.
Nevertheless, short-term momentum indicators have turned bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-January. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs gapped up and closed sharply higher following
Thursday's friendly monthly cold storage report confirming Thursday's
upside reversal. Spillover support from sharply higher belly and
cattle prices also underpinned today's rally. Talk of steady cash
bids next week could support steady to higher prices on Monday
however, trading volume will be very thin leaving the door open for
volatile trading. Today's gap up may prove to be an upside breakaway
gap. While a setback is possible on Monday, the stage is set for a
test of November's high crossing at 55.35 later this winter. Momentum
indicators are higher signaling that additional gains are possible
into early-January. 

February cattle closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering
ahead of this afternoon's cattle-on-feed report. The report was
called bullish for the April and June contracts because of the
less-than-expected placements. Today's new high close for the week
following by a friendly cattle-on-feed report sets the stage for a
possible test of November's high crossing at 71.35 later this winter.
Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible into early-January. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed sharply lower on Friday as it posted a key
reversal down ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. Locals and
funds were late sellers as they took advantage of thin pre-holiday
trading volume. Additional weakness next week is needed to confirm
today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below 44.75 would confirm a
breakout into new contract lows thereby opening the door for a
possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later
this winter. 

March cocoa posted a quiet inside day with a slightly higher close on
Friday as it continues to consolidate below Wednesday's gap crossing
at 1297. Momentum indicators have turned bearish with this week's
setback thereby increasing the odds that a short-term top is in
place. If the decline resumes next week, December's low crossing at
1212 is March's next target. Closes below 1212 would open the door
for a larger-degree decline into January. 

March sugar posted an inside day with a slightly higher on Friday as
it extended Thursday's short covering bounce following this week's
spike below the 50% retracement level of this fall's rally crossing
at 698. Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are possible into early-January. I am looking for March
to renew this week's decline next week with November's low crossing
at 661 being a possible target later this winter. 

March cotton closed higher on Friday due to light short covering
ahead of the Christmas Holiday weekend. This week's setback has
turned stochastics and the RSI bearish again signaling that sideways
to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. Closes above
37.60 or below 34.91 are needed to clear up near-term direction in
the market. 

I want to wish each and every one of you a very Merry Christmas. Take
time to find and remember why we are celebrating Christmas. Ken

Please contact Jeff Hodge with the details of the cuts.  He needs the details to make the best case for Enron.  Please email your response to me before talking to Jeff.

Thanks,

Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Jeff

Jeff,

How should proceed with Texaco and their 1.5 million withholding?


Thanks,

2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

Keith,

I changed the report information as you requested.
Please let me know if there are additional changes 
you need. On some of the storage points
the current balance information is not available.
I will work towards getting these, in the meantime
let me know what else would be needed.

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Sorry to bother you, I know you are extremely busy, but I was emailing to ask you a few quick questions and get a bit of advice.&nbsp; I have seen in the news that Enron plans to sell at least a 51% stake in the trading operations in the January 10th auction, and I wasn't sure if you knew what that might mean for me.&nbsp; As you know, the market is quite flooded with ex-Enron employees and finding an entry-level job in the&nbsp;energy industry isn't a very easy task.&nbsp; I have sent my resume to many firms, with little luck besides a possible real-time position with Duke Energy.&nbsp; So,&nbsp;I was just checking with you to see if there is any chance that I may have a job come&nbsp;January with your desk, or if&nbsp;my odds would be better with another&nbsp;company.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may not know the answer to some of my questions, and I understand completely why you wouldn't quite know.&nbsp; Thanks so much for your help and advice,&nbsp; Scott Freeman</DIV>

"Program Changes","
As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

"Nov. 20th P&L","Mike, after we corrected the CGPR-KINGSGATE, your P&L decreased to (40,473).  The P&L did not change by much because you do not have a position at Kingsgate.  The gain that was seen in physical current month MTM value was offset by a loss in transport revenue.  The estimate was mainly off because of the price curveshift which is taken directly from TDS.  The difference between my estimate and the actual price curveshift totaled approximately 650,000.  Let me know if you have any more questions Mike.  Thanks.

 	  	 Dear Mike,

It's been one year since ENL began broadcasting - log on Tuesday and join the Energy News Live celebration. We've scheduled a full day of coverage and special guests to commemorate our anniversary. 

At the top of the list is our continuing live coverage of the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will bring us an interview with European Union Energy Commissioner Loyola De Palacio. Join us on Tuesday as De Palacio discusses the reliability of energy supplies for Europe. 

The Washington bureau will have the latest on the anthrax situation and how it's impacting Congress. At noon ET Tuesday, the bureau is expected to talk with Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman about the chance the Senate will consider energy legislation before Congress adjourns for the year. 

Also from the Washington bureau on Tuesday, Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King will give us his thoughts on where energy legislation stands in Congress. King will drop by during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast. 

Former FERC Chairman James Hoecker will also speak with us from Washington on Tuesday. Hoecker will discuss the newest FERC nominee, Joe Kelliher, and what the Commission accomplished with its recently concluded RTO week during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

The Houston bureau also has some great guests scheduled on Tuesday. Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey will join us during the 1:00 p.m. ET newscast. He'll discuss the crisis in risk management over the last year. 

We'll also hear from Merrill Lynch Lead Energy Analyst Donato Eassey. He'll drop by the Houston bureau to discuss the difficulties of this year, and where the energy industry goes from here. Eassey is penciled in during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

ENL's Kym McNicholas will have more on the California Department of Water Resources from the West Coast bureau on Tuesday. The CDWR is holding a workshop in Sacramento to explain new revenue requirements and how the factors involved will bring down costs. 

Kym says we'll also have more from former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and his thoughts on deregulation. We'll have details from these stories and more on Tuesday from the West Coast bureau. 

From Columbus, Ohio, AEP Spokesperson Pat Hemlepp will discuss AEP's earnings report due out Tuesday. Hemlepp will also bring us an update on changes at AEP's payment processing center in the wake of the anthrax scares, and the importance of electronic payments, during the 11:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Marcus Howell: Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese 
at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?

G.G. - Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Eric Fernau: Which three running backs should I start?  I 
have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest 
Holmes and Garrison Hearst.

G.G. - Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

Jay Rassat: Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

G.G. - Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not 
have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for 
people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be 
surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a 
great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a 
back like Alexander.

<!-- Q1 --> 
Who would you start in Week 11: <B>Brian Griese</B> 
at Dallas or <B>Jake Plummer</B> at San Diego?
</font></p><b><font face=""Arial"" size=""2"" color=""#163786""> 
<!-- Q1 answer title --> 
Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q1 answer --> 
Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries 
this season, and with <B>Rod Smith</B> questionable with an ankle 
injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been 
bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer 
seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But 
remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has 
never been able to string many good performances together in 
the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be 
primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by 
Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post 
respectable numbers at Dallas.

Which three running backs should I start?  I

Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q2 answer -->
Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is 
facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but 
will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside. 
Staley should have little trouble ripping through the 
Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at 
Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon, 
Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.

<!-- Q3 --> 
Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have 
<B>Tom Brady</B>, <B>Aaron Brooks</B> and <B>Trent Green</B>. The defenses they 
play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).

<!-- Q3 answer title --> 
Answer - GG
</font></b><p><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- Q3 answer -->
Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and 
each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play. 
Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of 
a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady. 
With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew 
Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New 
England QB.

<B>Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT:</B> <B>Ricky Watters'</B> decision to not

The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday.

Warrick, who was benched late in last week's game, is expected to start. He has been a disappointment this year and Fantasy players should not use him at this point of the postseason. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1152&""><B>Jerome Bettis</B></A>, Active RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/25/01</FONT><BR>
Bettis is listed as questionable for Week 16. However, he may be able to return to the Steelers' starting lineup. Bill Cowher said Bettis is progressing, and he will be used this week if healthy. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1265&""><B>Keyshawn Johnson</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR>
Johnson has caught a lot of passes this season, but has only one TD reception. Nevertheless, he will still be a reliable receiver in your playoffs.<BR>
</FONT><BR>

Staley started to play well late in the season. Be sure to keep him into your starting lineup. He will be an adequate back for the playoffs. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1140&""><B>Tyrone Wheatley</B></A>, Reserve RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR>
Wheatley, who was not used last week, is expected to see some playing time in Week 15. He will probably not be used enough, however, to help most Fantasy teams. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=12484&""><B>Joe Jurevicius</B></A>, Active WR<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/19/01</FONT><BR>
Jurevicius (hamstring) is expected to return to action on Sunday. He may be able to catch a deep ball or two against the erratic Seattle secondary. <BR>
</FONT><BR>

Conway injured his shin on Saturday against Oakland. His current status is day to day.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=133263&""><B>Daunte Culpepper</B></A>, Active QB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/16/01</FONT><BR>
Culpepper will probably need to undergo arthroscopic surgery this week on a sprained left knee that kept him out of the Vikings 27-24 loss to Detroit on Sunday. ""It's a small scope, not a big deal at all,"" Minnesota coach Dennis Green said. ""Whether it's a 10-day injury or a two-week injury, you never know."" Culpepper had been expected to play this week after sitting out last week. He began the week listed as probable, but was downgraded to doubtful after his knee was still swelling and sore after taking some snaps on Wednesday and Thursday. He sat out of Friday's practice and was officially listed as inactive. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1033&""><B>Rob Johnson</B></A>, Reserve QB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 12/13/01</FONT><BR>
The <i>Buffalo News</i> says there is a possibility Johnson might return for the season's final game. ""The healing has gone very well,"" Gregg Williams said. ""He's probably got another couple of weeks of the bone healing. We hope that he'll be able to get back into the practice situation within a couple of weeks and start to work on the field and be able to do some non-contact things. We'll continue to evaluate how it moves from that point forward."" <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=235123&""><B>Travis Minor</B></A>, Reserve RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 11/21/01</FONT><BR>
The Dolphins may use Minor a fair amount Sunday against Buffalo to keep the defense honest. He could be worth using in a deep league since the Bills have been weak against the run all season.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=187503&""><B>Trung Canidate</B></A>, Reserve RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 11/11/01</FONT><BR>
Canidate got almost all of the carries in the second half of Sunday's game against Carolina. With St. Louis way ahead, coach Mike Martz obviously rested stud back Marshall Faulk, who had 183 yards rushing and two touchdowns in the first half. Canidate finished the game with 145 yards rushing and a touchdown. However, don't expect Canidate to get as much playing time in games where the score isn't so one-sided. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=21&""><B>Raiders</B></A>, Active DT<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 10/02/01</FONT><BR>
The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=235228&""><B>Deuce McAllister</B></A>, Reserve RB<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 09/02/01</FONT><BR>
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. ""That was probably the best he's run the whole year,"" Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. ""I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do."" While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3696&key=1387&""><B>Mike Hollis</B></A>, Active K<FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=1> Updated 07/27/01</FONT><BR>
Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts. <BR>

. ""We're going to play Skip more,"" Fisher said. ""We're going to play Skip, if at all possible, as much as he played [Sunday] night ? But I also want to get Eddie [George] 1,000 yards.''

He wasn't a reliable weekly starter during the Fantasy playoffs to begin with, and Benjamin Gay and Jamel White, who are less reliable starters, are likely to split time the rest of the way if Jackson is out.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1681&""><B>Corey Dillon</B></A>, RB CIN - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Dillon's dislocated finger has improved, and he should be fine for this week.

The Bengals placed Smith on injured reserve with a hamstring injury Tuesday, officially ending his season. He will likely need surgery to reattach the muscle group in his hamstring to the bone. Jon Kitna will probably start in his place the rest of the season if he's healthy, but we don't recommend any Cincinnati quarterback the rest of the year anyway.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1177&""><B>Terry Allen</B></A>, RB BAL - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Ravens are likely to feature one running back Sunday against Cincinnati after Allen, Moe Williams and Obafemi Ayanbadejo combined for just 10 carries for 40 yards in Week 14. Allen is the likely starter of the three after he recovered from a hand injury. None of the three is a worthy starter in a Fantasy league regardless of whether he starts.</FONT></FONT><!

While Brees is not expected to play, he may see some playing time in the Week 16 finale against Seattle. Flutie is a very risky player during the Fantasy playoffs, especially in light of the possibility he could sit in favor of Brees at any time.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3213&key=1645&""><B>Priest Holmes</B></A>, RB KC - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/18/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Holmes is likely to skip practice Wednesday and possibly Thursday due to a sore groin muscle.

<a href="" http://store.ino.com/sale/1E78A/TWTSN-TurtleSecrets "">Turtle Trading Method Revealed</a>
_____________________________________________________________________ 

Dear Trader:

Now you can learn the most powerful, valuable and profitable 
trading method EVER!

. . . Now Revealed In This Complete Trading Course 
For Just A Small, No-Risk Investment 

World Famous ?Turtle? Commodity Trading Method 
. . . Now Available To You 

On Video And In Clear Trading Lessons 
In The Privacy Of Your Home 
. . . At A VERY Affordable Low, Low Price!!

Fifteen years ago, one futures trader stunned the entire trading 
world as he methodically turned $400 into over $200,000,000 
trading futures. In 1983, he personally taught his trading 
strategies and systems to 14 people he nicknamed ?The Turtles.?

In the next five years, the Turtles earned some $35,000,000 as 
their percent of profits from the $175 million profit they made 
for their teacher (who bankrolled their trading)!

Yes, those zeroes are correct.

As a group, the ?Turtles? have been trading now for over 14 years 
and currently manage $2,000,000,000 (2 BILLION dollars) given to 
them from people and institutions all over the world. Estimated 
profits for the 16 months ending this past April are over 
$300,000,000 (that's 300 million dollars actual, documented 
profits!)

Even now - 14 years later - five of the world's top 10 futures 
money managers are Turtle traders!

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Trent Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1599&>, QB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Green should move the ball with ease against the Cardinals this week. But the Chiefs might depend on the run, so his numbers may be limited.

Ken Dilger <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1334&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Dilger is not a major factor in the Indianapolis passing game anymore. Don't expect much from him against the underrated New England defense this week.

Marcus Pollard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=play! er! s&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1335&>, TE IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pollard has emerged as Indianpolis' top option at tight end. He will once again be a key factor in the passing game against New England this week,

Edgerrin James <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133320&>, RB IND - TexOK Updated 10/18/01
James was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against New England this year. Expect much better numbers on James' home turf this week.

Reggie Wayne <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235256&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Wayne is expected to start in place of the injured Jerome Pathon for the second co! ns! ecutive week. Wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your Fantasy lineup.

Marvin Harrison <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1231&>, WR IND - Metz Updated 10/18/01
Harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned Patriots CB Ty Law in the past. Expect him to produce good numbers against New England.

Peyton Manning <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12531&>, QB IND - Grigsby Updated 10/18/01
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Randy Moss <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12576! &>, WR MIN - Metz Updated 10/18/01
Moss did not participate in practice Wednesday due to his sore right ankle. He should be able to practice on Thursday and play Sunday against Green Bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play.

Bill Schroeder <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1593&>, WR GB - The Rocks Updated 10/18/01
Schroeder missed practice Wednesday with an ankle injury. He is receiving treatment and should play Sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week.

Terry Glenn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1254&>, WR NE - The Rocks Updated 10/18/01
Glenn might! h! ave another good game this week. Indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling Glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week. 

Antowain Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1663&>, RB NE - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01
Smith rushed for 94 yards and two TDs the first time he faced the Colts this year. Expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with Indianapolis.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/18/01
Chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. He could have a good week if the Jets engage in a shootout with the Rams. He is still a risky start, because New York will center its gameplan around Curtis Martin.

Laveranues Coles <http://football210! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187742&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the Jets, but might be held down by the Rams. The St. Louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed.

Curtis Martin <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1132&>, RB NYJ - FJS Updated 10/18/01
Martin will be the focal point of the New York offense this week. The Jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the Rams. 

Stephen Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1440&>, RB WAS - TexOK Updated 10/18/01
Davis had his first decent ga! me! of the season on Monday against Dallas, but he's still a very risky Fantasy player due to Washington's horrible offense. Facing Carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting Davis this week warrants consideration. 

Tony Banks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Banks was very mediocre against Dallas on Monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. At this point, Banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1310&>, WR WAS - McKay Updated 10/18/01
Westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. He's had some success against the Panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Vinny Testaverde <http://foo! tb! all210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1007&>, QB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Testaverde might not be a good start this week. The St. Louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the Jets QB throw his first interception of the year.

Walter Rasby <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1320&>, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end now that Stephen Alexander is out. However, he warrants no real Fantasy consideration at this point. 

Rod Gardner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Gardner could have a decent game against a questionable Carolina secondary on Monday. He's worth considering as a starter Fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. 

Torry Holt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133310&>, WR STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky N.Y. Jets secondary on Sunday. He's a big time Fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. 

Isaac Bruce <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1294&>, WR STL - Fear Updated 10/18/01
Bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. Look for him to turn things around against the questionable N.Y. Jets secondary. 

Ernie Conwell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1366&>, TE STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Conwell has become a decent tight end from a Fantasy perspective this season. He's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. 

Trung Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Canidate will likely replace Marshall Faulk as St. Louis' featured back this weekend against the N.Y. Jets. He has a good knowledge of the Rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a Fantasy perspective. 

Kurt Warner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=12797&>, QB STL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/18/01
Considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, Warner is a a must-start every week. He'll post another big game against the New York Jets on Sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. 

Correll Buckhalter <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=235031&>, RB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Buckhalter isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on Monday night against the Giants. Coach Andy Reid will start Duce Staley in the backfield, but Buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs. 

Donovan McNabb <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
McNabb is one of the top Fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. He should beat the Giants for two scores and around 275 yards on Monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. 

Todd Pinkston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Pinkston is slowly becoming one of Donovan McNabb's favorite targets this season. He's worth starting against the Giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has su! st! ained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that. 

Chad Lewis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2156&key=1755&>, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid Fantasy numbers on Monday against the N.Y. Giants. He's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.

"CA Regulators Approve Unbundling for SoCalGas Pipe/Storage System","NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : December 12, 2001
CA Regulators Approve Unbundling for SoCalGas Pipe/Storage System 
A comprehensive settlement among stakeholders to further unbundle Southern California Gas Co.'s in-state transmission and storage operations was approved by California regulators Tuesday. The vote on the long-delayed measure, however, was split 3-2 with one of the majority appointees of current Gov. Gray Davis joining two holdover commissioners in approving the disputed settlement. 
The two dissenting members of the California Public Utilities Commission, including the panel's president, cited market volatility that has occurred in the 18 months since the state's most recent natural gas strategy advocated unbundling. They thought the state should learn more about the fundamentals of the not-too-distant natural gas price spikes before making ""such radical changes in the natural gas system."" The unbundling strategy was formulated under past CPUC President and still Commissioner Richard Bilas. 
Saying ""this day has been a long time in coming,"" Bilas pushed for his recommendation to approve the settlement among 30 stakeholders that will allow ""firm tradable capacity rights"" to both SoCalGas' transmission and storage systems, arguing that it would provide SoCal customers with more reliability and options to reduce costs than would the status quo. He noted that the issues being addressed do not include insufficient capacity, but rather a question of ""what costs and under what terms"" customers can get gas supplies. 
California's long-active statewide utility consumer watchdog group, TURN (The Utility Reform Network) in San Francisco, almost immediately issued a statement predicting the CPUC's decision ""could be disastrous for consumers,"" setting the stage for potential ""gouging that occurred under California's failed electric deregulation scheme. 
""The settlement was proposed back in April of 2000 before the full impacts of deregulation were clear, and was supported by gas marketers and Southern California Gas Co., who stand to profit from more gas deregulation,"" TURN said in its reaction statement. ""Today's decision allows SoCalGas to sell off rights to ship gas on its transmission system to the highest bidder, rather than at rates set by the (CPUC)."" 
TURN attorney Marcel Hawiger said the door is now open for ""marketers and middlemen to bilk us by controlling gas flow within the state, just as FERC allowed them to do on the interstate pipeline last winter,"" referring to the alleged abuses by El Paso Natural Gas Co. and other interstate marketers to the California-Arizona border. 
Bilas said he recognized the concerns for small, captive core customers, and that is why he modified the comprehensive settlement to provide the protection for retail customers and against wholesale market manipulation. The protections include reducing allowable market concentrations from 40% to 30%, and putting price caps on secondary market transactions of 120% of the tariff rate, and keeping core reserved storage levels at 70 Bcf, rather than lowering as the settlement called for to 55 Bcf. In addition, core reservation levels on the SoCal pipeline system within the state will match those on the interstate pipelines of a little over 1 Bcf/d. 
Commissioners Lynch and Carl Wood, the other two Davis appointees, strongly opposed the unbundling, largely based on the electric restructuring problems of the past 18 months and the conclusion that new data on the state's natural gas industry --p ost-electricity crisis -- is needed to provide a ""reliable basis to make major changes in the SoCalGas system."" The action put SoCalGas' operations on the same footing as the PG&E gas transmission operations in which customers willing to provide daily balancing will not be charged for system-wide imbalances. 
Wood and Lynch thought that the action was not supportable in the regulatory case record in the current market conditions for natural gas and electricity. Regardless of the CPUC's action, Wood said the CPUC will expect SoCalGas to provide various consumer and safety protections from the ""border to the burnertips."" 
Lynch said the gas settlement ""was a difficult case to get my arms around"" because of its complexity, but she said the issues are fundamental and will impact how the CPUC staff and the market can operate in the years ahead.

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

The Dollar stood strong and Equities were boosted by a positive
consumer sentiment survey as trading slowed down ahead of the
Christmas holiday.  A late flurry in Cattle, Hogs and Bellies
featured commodity markets, with Cattle pushing to a two-week 
high.  Silver continued to shine as lease rates stayed firm, 
and Gold followed in symnpathy with the Argentina situation a
background factor.  Another rally attempt by Coffee on Thursday
was dashed, Cocoa ended quietly mixed, while Cotton ended with
small gains but a soft undertone.  Book squaring jimmied Energies.
Soybeans were flat, Wheat mixed and Corn down on export
uncertainties.

Player Updates NFL Reports 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jeff Garcia <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=146325&>, QB SF - Fear Updated 10/18/01
According to published reports, Garcia has been instructed not to pick up a football until the Niners begin practicing again next week. Garcia is dealing with a sore throwing elbow, as well as a few other nagging bumps and bruises. However, he's still expected to start in the 49ers' next game on Oct. 28 against Chicago. 

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, WR BUF - Grigsby Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacks! on! ville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Eric Moulds <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1196&>, WR BUF - Fear Updated 10/18/01
Moulds might get in the end zone against Jacksonville. Look for the Bills to move him around often against the injury-riddled Jaguars secondary.

Larry Centers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Centers has been Buffalo's most reliable receiver so far, but that trend might change against Jacksonville. Buffalo might look to attack an injury-riddled Jaguars secondary with passes to WR Peerless Price and TE Jay Riemersma.

Drew Bledsoe <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leagu! e=! ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1041&>, QB NE - Top Dogs Updated 10/18/01
There's a very slim chance Bledsoe will be in uniform as the emergency quarterback this week . Bledsoe was upgraded from ""out"" to ""doubtful"" on the injury report, but he's lost 15 pounds and hasn't been cleared to run, throw or be hit. He has pedaled a stationary bicycle and probably would just hand off the ball if Brady and No. 2 quarterback Damon Huard are sidelined. Bledsoe's progress has been slower than he hoped and there's no timetable for his return. 

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/18/01
Wheatley won't practice during the team's week off and could possibly miss the next game because of an injured right knee. ""Tyrone Wheatley has a second degree - ! I ! don't know if it's a sprain or a tear - of his MCL,""' coach Jon Gruden said Wednesday. Gruden called Wheatley questionable for the Oct. 28 game at Philadelphia. He said he would learn more about the injury as the week progressed. He disputed reports that Wheatley would be out four weeks. ""I would not agree with that at this time,"" Gruden said. 

Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/18/01
Weinke sat out practice Wednesday and it's uncertain whether he will play in Washington on Sunday because of a thigh injury. The injury is more serious than the Panthers first expected. Seifert said Monday that Weinke had a deep thigh bruise, but expected him to practice Wednesday. Seifert said he didn't know if Weinke would practice Thursday. Dameyune Craig would start if Weinke cannot play.

Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/18/01
Griese said Wednesday his sore shoulder has improved and ! he! 's confident he'll play Sunday against San Diego. Griese complained of shoulder soreness after a hit against the Kansas City Chiefs on Oct. 7. The problem was aggravated Sunday when he was slammed to the turf by Seattle Seahawks defensive end Lamar King. Tests Monday showed no structural damage to his shoulder. 

Redskins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=30&>, DT WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Cornerback Champ Bailey missed practice on Wednesday due to a sprained ankle, but he's expected to play on Sunday. Fred Smoot (leg), however, is in danger of missing this weekend's contest against Carolina. Darrell Green would replace Smoot if he's unable to go. 

Rob Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1183&>, WR ARI - FJS Updated 10/17/01
Moore (hamstring) is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Kansas City. He hasn't been full speed at practice, however, so don't be surprised if his status is downgraded over the next two days. 

Patrick Jeffers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jeffers (knees) saw extensive work in practice today and may be ready to play this weekend against New Orleans. However, Jeffers is too risky to start from a Fantasy perspective. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1203&>, WR CAR - TayDang Updated 10/17/01
Muhammad's ribs are still sore after taking a few shots during Sunday's game against New Orleans. Coach George Seifert expects him to play, but he may be somewhat limited. Unless his status improves by the end of the week, Fantasy owners may want to consider benching Muhammad if at al! l ! possible. 

Chris Weinke <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235174&>, QB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Weinke missed practice on Wednesday due to a thigh injury. However, Head Coach George Seifert expects the rookie quarterback to start on Sunday against Washington. If you need a quarterback this week, Weinke is a good choice facing a terrible Redskins' defense. 

Terance Mathis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1189&>, WR ATL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01
Mathis (hand) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to start on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's only worth starting in deeper leagues from a Fantasy perspective. 
Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Jefferson (toe) returned to practice on Wednesday. He is expected to be in the starting lineup on Sunday against New Orleans, but he's too unreliable to use Fantasy-wise. 

Ryan Leaf <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Leaf worked with he first team offense during practice on Wednesday. He was filling in for Anthony Wright, who was given the day off to rest his swollen right knee. Leaf will have his chance to win the starting job in Dallas, but he has no real Fantasy value at this time. 

! Troy Hambrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=194768&!>, RB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Now that Robert Thomas is gone for the year, Hambrick is expected to become Dallas' starting fullback. He's shown flashes of brilliance at times, but his value as a Fantasy player is still minimal at this point. 

Michael Bennett <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Bennett is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a right ankle injury. Expect Doug Chapman to get the start, with Travis Prentice serving as his backup. Don't use Bennett this week.

Randy Moss <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12576&>, WR MIN - Metz Updated 10/17/01
! Moss is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Green Bay with a right ankle injury. While we normally tell you to start him every week, this is one matchup we wouldn't activate him for unless it becomes completely clear he will start.

Shane Matthews <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=4719&>, QB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
The Bears re-signed Matthews on Tuesday. He returns to his old backup QB job and isn't worth adding to your Fantasy roster.

Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Davis would like to return to the lineup Su! nd! ay at San Diego. He has recovered from a knee injury, and Broncos Head Coach Mike Shanahan wants him to return by November 4. We don't recommend you use Davis this week, although this development also makes it tough to recommend you start any Broncos running back. 

Stacey Mack <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=134327&>, RB JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Mack will get a lot of carries this week but don't expect him to be too productive. He only gained 17 yards on nine carries in the Jaguars' previous. 

Keenan McCardell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1235&>, WR JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01
McCardell struggled in his first few games back from injury, but looked like his old self in the previous game. Look for McCardell to play well this week and catch a lot of passes. 

Sean Dawkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&r! an! dom=2098&key=1230&>, WR JAC - The Rocks Updated 10/17/01
Dawkins will have a tough time against Buffalo this week. He will catch of couple of passes but won't find his way into the end zone. 

Mark Brunell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1032&>, QB JAC - FJS Updated 10/17/01
Brunell is no longer being bothered by headaches and is expected to play in Week Six. Look for him to throw for over 200 yards and a score. 

Kyle Brady <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1356&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/17/01
Brady is expected to play in this week's game despite a hip injury, and is listed as probable. He won't be too productive if he does pl! ay! . Brady only has five catches this season. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/17/01
Smith has been very consistent this season. Look for him to catch several passes and score a touchdown against Buffalo.

Herman Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1222&>, WR DET - Top Dogs Updated 10/17/01
Moore will miss the remainder of the season after tearing a muscle in his hip during Sunday's game at Minnesota. ""We're disappointed the injury is much worse than we thought,"" Lions Head Coach Marty Mornhinweg said. ""We believed it was a minor pull, but the MRI showed a significant tear in the muscle."" Drop Moore if he was on your Fantasy team.! L! arry Foster assumes the No. 3 receiver job in Detroit.

Tyrone Wheatley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1140&>, RB OAK - Pink Panthers Updated 10/17/01
According to published reports, Wheatley will miss three to four weeks with a right knee sprain. The veteran back was beginning to lose carries to Charlie Garner before he was hurt.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Grigsby Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Peerless Price <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Charlie Garner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Joey Galloway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/17/01
Galloway (ankle) is expected to take this week off from practice in order to rest his injury. He will be re-evaluated next Monday, at which time his status for the Oct. 28 game against Arizona will be determined. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/16/01
Faulk has not been ruled out of Sunday's game against the New York Jets despite a bruised right knee. ""He really could possibly play this week,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""We're not going to rule the possibility of him playing completely out."" If Faulk is unable to go, however, Trung Canidate will be the featured back in the game. At this point, it's tough to make a decision on whether or not to start Faulk Fantasy-wise, so monitor the situation throughout the week. 

Tiki Barber <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/16/01
Barber (hamstring) is expected to return to practice on Thursday. Barring any setbacks, Barber will be available for Monday's game against Philadelphia. With the emergence of Ron Dayne, however, Barber may see a drop in his Fantasy value over the coming weeks. 

Germane Crowell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/14/01
Crowell had a strong outing against Minnesota, catching nine passes for 125 yards and a score. He's still not consistent enough to use every week at this point, but he's easily worth a roster spot if available. 

Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/14/01
Ward had another solid outing. While he caught four passes for only 38 yards, he did catch a five-yard TD pass, once again proving he is the only reliable wideout on the Pittsburgh roster,

Peyton Manning <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/12/01
Manning should throw at least two TD passes against Oakland. The Raiders' secondary runs hot and cold, and sometimes has trouble with marquee quarterbacks.

Jaguars <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01
Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. 

Chargers <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01
Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. 

Carl Pickens <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01
Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. 

Troy Aikman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01
Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. 

Brett Conway <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2098&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00
Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.

"JM Huber Transaction- Confidential","Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

"New FERC Policy on Negotiated Rate Deals","This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is ""significant potential for undue discrimination"" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the ""linchpin"" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was ""important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side,"" that ""all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines."" Last week's proclamation should be considered ""a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend,"" he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties ""are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk"" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a ""key factor"" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
""appropriate material deviation"" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide ""adequate alternatives"" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, ""we have reconsidered that holding"" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
""adequate alternative,"" the commission observed. ""However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision."" A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it ""an advantage over recourse-rate shippers,"" the commission pointed out.
""A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,""
FERC said, adding that ""such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner.""
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights ""is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated"" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language ""will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers.""
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become ""muddled."" Through a ""tortured line of cases,"" FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were ""obscured,"" Breathitt said in welcoming the new ""common-sense""
approach. The ""tug of war"" that parties have engaged in over the past few years ""really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service"" are available to all shippers, she said.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes were mixed on Wednesday. The NASDAQ closed lower on
Wednesday on ideas that some of the tech stocks have become
overvalues, which triggered a round of profit taking by investors.
Additional pressure came from news that Motorola will trim its job
force by another 9,400 jobs. Closes above last week?s high at 2036.54
would temper the bearish outlook for the NASDAQ and could lead to
sideways to higher prices into the end of the year. Closes below
1898.80 would open the door for a larger-degree decline into early-
January. The March S&P 500 index closed higher for the fourth day in
a row on Wednesday as it continues to rebounded off the 25%
retracement level of this fall?s rally crossing at 1120.66. However,
it will take closes above December's high at 1176 to renew this
fall's rally. Until then, I would not be surprised to see March trade
sideways into the end of the year. 

The Dow closed higher for the third day in a row on Wednesday.
Support came from better-than-expected leading economic indicators
for November. The Dow has fought back from last week's low and is
poised to test broken trendline support and the 62% retracement level
of the May/September decline crossing at 10,094.10. Closes above
these two resistance levels are needed to renew this fall's rally. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

March T-bonds extended their rebound off Monday's on Wednesday and is
challenging trendline resistance drawn across the Nov./Dec. highs,
which crosses near 101-16. Support came from better-than-expected
leading economic indicators for November. Multiple closes above the
aforementioned downtrend line are needed to confirm a bottom and
trend change. Momentum indicators are diverging and have turned
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible into
the end of the year. However, I would not be surprised to see a pause
if not minor setback on Thursday as March may try to consolidate some
of this week's short covering gains ahead of the Christmas Holiday. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed lower for the third day in a row on Wednesday
due to weakness in meats, precious metals, fiber and natural gas.
Today's low fell short of retesting this fall's uptrend line. Closes
above 193.39 or below 187.73 are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish
signaling that sideways to higher prices are still possible into the
end of the year.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed higher on Wednesday following Tuesday's API
inventory reports, which were supportive to the markets. The reports
showed that crude oil stocks rose by 929,000 barrels last week.
Distillate stocks including heating oil declined by 1.011 million
barrels and gasoline stocks fell by 873,000 barrels last week.
Additional support came from expectations for a cold snap in U.S.
weather to begin shortly after the first of the new year.

February crude oil extended this week's breakout above the fall?s
downtrend while opening the door for a test of the early-December
high crossing at 21.05 later this winter. Closes above this
resistance level could lead to a test of the 38% retracement level of
this fall's decline, which crosses at 21.77. Momentum indicators are
bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible.

February heating oil closed higher on Wednesday but fell just short
of testing the early-December high crossing at 57.85. Momentum
indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are
possible near-term. Closes above this resistance level would open the
door for a larger-degree rebound into early-January. Today's rally
was supported by the latest API inventor report that showed a 1.011
million-barrel decline in U.S. stocks last week. With forecasts
calling for colder weather for the East Coast by early-January,
additional short-covering gains are possible into the end of the
year.

February unleaded gas spiked above the early-December high of 57.62
on Wednesday following Tuesday's friendly API inventory report.
Profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's gains
leaving the door open for sideways trading on Thursday. However,
momentum indicators are bullish signaling that additional strength is
possible into the end of the year. Closes above 57.62 would set the
stage for a test of November's gap crossing at 59.80 in the near
future. 

February Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday ahead of the
release of this week's AGA inventory report. Low consumer demand due
to above normal temps across the high demand regions of the U.S.
along with lower industrial demand continues to weigh on prices.
Closes above the Oct./Nov. downtrend line or below December's low at
2.58 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. Short-
term momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish hinting that
sideways to lower prices are possible into the end of the year. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The March Dollar gapped up and closed higher on Wednesday as it
extends this week's short covering rebound. Closes above gap
resistance crossing at 116.55 are needed to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the market. Stochastics and the RSI are oversold
and turning bullish signaling that a low was likely posted with
Monday's spike below the 50% retracement level of the Sept./Nov.
rally crossing at 115.42. 

The March Swiss Franc closed lower on Wednesday. Early weakness
spiked below minor trendline support drawn across last week's low. A
short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's
loss allowing March to close at minor trendline support crossing at
.6105. Additional weakness is needed to turn short-term momentum
indicators bearish. Closes above .6182 would open the door for a
larger-degree rebound into January.

The March Canadian Dollar closed lower on Wednesday thereby
confirming Tuesday's breakout below the Nov./Dec. uptrend line.
Session lows spiked below the 38% retracement level of November's
rally crossing at .6342. I would not be surprised to see a short
covering bounce on Thursday as March might try to consolidate some of
this week's losses. At the same time, momentum indicators have turned
bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible into
early-January. 

The March Japanese Yen closed lower on Wednesday as it continues to
drift lower following the recent breakout below weekly support
crossing at .7903. If the decline continues, monthly fib support
crossing at .7568 is the next target later this winter. The daily ADX
signals that additional weakness is possible. It would take closes
above November?s downtrend line crossing near .7990 to confirm a
bottom and trend change has taken place.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

February gold closed sharply lower on Wednesday due to profit taking,
which was triggered by a firmer U.S. Dollar. Today's close below the
early-December high crossing at 278.70 strongly suggests that the
initial short covering rebound off last week's low has likely come to
an end. Stochastics and the RSI are turning neutral to bearish with
today's loss warning traders that additional weakness into the end of
December is possible. 

March silver posted a huge key reversal down on Wednesday after early
strength led to a spike above the 50% retracement level crossing at
4.423. Today's sharp decline and low-range close sets the stage for
additional long- liquidation on Thursday. March closed below initial
trendline support crossing near 4.34 thereby increasing the odds that
a short-term top has been posted. Stochastics and the RSI have also
turned bearish from overbought levels signaling that additional
long-liquidation appears likely into the end of the year. 

March copper closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering
ahead of the close. March continues to consolidate above December's
broken downtrend line as it is trying to solidify a bottom.
Short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that
additional short covering gains are possible into the end of the
year. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed fractionally higher on Wednesday due to spillover
support from sharply higher wheat prices. However, the corn market
remains paralyzed by the uncertainty of which supply/demand scenario
will play out in 2002. With export demand still running below the
pace needed to reach this year's USDA projection, bulls are having a
tough go of trying to build a case for higher prices anytime soon.
Traders are not expecting any major surprises in Thursday's
supply/demand report, as light pre-holiday trading volume will likely
leave March corn range bound between 2.23 and 2.10 1/4 into January.

March wheat closed sharply higher on Wednesday as news that China
purchased 200,000 metric tonnes of U.S. wheat triggered fund buying
that pushed it above minor resistance crossing at 2.90 1/2. While
light profit taking ahead of the close tempered some of today's
gains, March is poised to test this fall's downtrend line crossing
near 2.95 later this month. Closes above this resistance level would
open the door for a likely test of October's high crossing at 3.03
later this winter. Momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed higher on Wednesday leaving Tuesday's key
reversal down unconfirmed. Talk that China bought about 15,000 tonnes
of U.S. soybean oil triggered today's short covering rebound. Traders
will pay close attention to Thursday's export sales report, which
needs to remain strong in order to keep the bean market from falling
any lower this winter. Closes above the Nov./Dec. downtrend line
crossing near 4.41 3/4 are needed before a short-term bottom can be
confirmed. Until then, the door remains open for a possible test of
this fall's low crossing at 4.26 1/2. Short-term momentum indicators
are bearish but becoming oversold hinting that a low might be near.

January soybean meal posted an inside day with a higher close due to
spillover support from bean oil, beans and wheat. Today's rally left
Tuesday's key reversal down unconfirmed. If the fall decline resumes,
the late-May low crossing at 146 is a possible target later this
month. Closes above 152 would temper the near-term bearish outlook in
the market. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs closed lower on Wednesday as futures prices, which is
premium to the cash market, are trying to realign themselves.
Additional pressure came from light position squaring ahead of the
release of the USDA's monthly cold storage report on Thursday.
Trading is likely to move into a holding pattern ahead of the
quarterly hogs and pigs' report due to be released on December 28th.
Cash bids are called steady for Thursday, which should support a
steady to firmer opening tomorrow. Momentum indicators are neutral to
bullish hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible near-
term. 

February cattle posted an inside day with a lower close due to light
profit taking as traders began to position themselves ahead of
Friday's cattle-on-feed report. This month's decline ahead of the
report suggests that the market has already discounted any bearish
news into prices. Expectations for a possible lull in marketings in
early- January as cattle were pulled forward due to mild weather
conditions this fall should help support February cattle into
early-January barring a bearish report on Friday. Closes above
Tuesday's high at 69.57 would open the door for a larger-degree
rebound this winter. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed higher on Wednesday due to light short covering
as it consolidated some of this week's loss. Early strength filled
Monday's gap at 47.40. However, a late sell off ahead of the close
tempered some of today's gains. While exchange stocks continue to
shrink, Brazil's massive crop now growing continues to trigger
producer selling on rallies. Short-term momentum indicators have
turned bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are possible
into the end of the year. Closes below this month's low crossing at
44.75 would renew this year?s decline while setting the stage for a
possible test of psychological support crossing at 40-cents later
this winter.

March cocoa gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday due to producer
hedging and light speculator selling. The upper range close leaves
the door open for a possible short covering bounce on Thursday. From
a broader perspective, March needs to close above November?s high at
1365 or below last week's low at 1212 to clear up near-term direction
in the market. The ability to hold at current levels in the height of
its supply period with the African main harvest advancing underscores
the firm tone underneath the market. 

March sugar closed lower on Wednesday and below the 50% retracement
level of this fall's rally crossing at 698. Today's sell off was
triggered by long-liquidation by funds. However, I would not be
surprised to see a short covering bounce on Thursday as March might
try to consolidate some of its recent losses. Longer-term, I am
looking for March to try and test November's low at 661. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that additional weakness near-term
is possible. 

March cotton gapped down and closed lower on Wednesday. However, a
short covering rally ahead of the close tempered much of today's loss
leaving the door open for additional short covering on Thursday if
this week's export sales report is bullish. Closes above the
Nov./Dec. downtrend line crossing near 37.45 are needed to confirm a
bottom has been posted.

"P&L estimates","Mike,

I would like to start asking your group for an estimate for their P&L's daily.  If our numbers come out over or under their tolerance we will call them before we sign off for the night so there are no surprises in the morning.  If you don't have a problem with this I would like to start this today.

Thanks

Kam

"FW: US #1 BCS Ranking is in Jeopardy","BCS is F-ing everything up...
 
-----Original Message-----
From: Stewart Ramser [mailto:sr@texasmusiconline.com] 
Sent: Friday, November 16, 2001 4:53 PM
To: Laura Childress
Subject: US #1 BCS Ranking is in Jeopardy


America could lose top spot in BCS computer rankings
First came the rout of Iraq's ""fierce fighting machine"" the Republican
Guard; then came the lopsided victory over the supposedly scrappy,
battle-hardened Taliban, but instead of these stunning wins keeping
America firmly in the number 1 slot, computer experts now believe it
could drop them in the BCS rankings to #2 or even the unthinkable #3. 
The problem is that no matter how much the U.S. has tried to hype their
opponents as worthy competitors, the BCS computer models aren't
reflecting it. In fact, in an unofficial BCS-style computer poll, the
Republican Guard ranks 236th just slightly ahead of Portugal's Royal
Protectors while the Taliban doesn't rank at all anymore. There's even
talk of placing the Taliban in another division, possibly with the
Medellin drug cartel and the Cribs.
""I don't think we should be penalized,"" said Secretary of Defense Donald
Rumsfeld. ""The AP had the Republican Guard ranked #4 before we invaded
Iraq and the Taliban have been recognized for years as brutal, religious
zealots, capable of fighting to the last man. These were top-notch
foes."" But others disagree, claiming the U.S. has erroneously promoted
the battle worthiness of their competition to make it seem that their
schedule is much more difficult.
""They have to fight somebody...it's that simple. They haven't fought
anybody good since Japan and Germany,"" said Greg Francize, assistant
director of the BCS Rankings. ""They need to take on a Russia, an
England, even a France would do. But this Arab, Muslim fanatic stuff it
just ain't gonna cut it anymore.""
Rumsfeld is not convinced. He ardently believes that the ranking
problems lie with the BCS computer models: ""We have remained undefeated
since 1975, and even if our recent rivals are not quite up to top-ten
play we annihilated them - -exactly what #1's are supposed to do. That
has to count for something."" Many believe the dispute illustrates the
need for an International Sudden Death Championship (ISDC) to determine
once and for all who's really #1. Sponsors are already lining up for the
possible event. FEDEX has offered the ISDC committee $1.5 billion for
the rights to name the war: The FEDEX World War III.
Advertising Age editors and others in the industry were shocked that
FEDEX would pay such an exorbitant amount. They point out that if the
Championship was fought between Russia and US it would last at most 25
minutes: ""a very poor return on a sponsorship dollar.""

Collins had a solid game yardage-wise against Minnesota, throwing for 321 yards on Monday night.

- THIS JUST IN FROM ONE OUR 575,000 USERS!

I just want to take a minute and tell you what a terrific 
job you all are doing there at INO.com. 

A while back I asked my broker if there was some way to get 
current, Intraday price updates on their otherwise very 
good on-line system. He said ?No?.  Then said, ?Wait a 
minute- try INO.com, they can give you 10 and 30-minute 
updates at no charge.? 

Well, it's been an enlightening experience every day since. 
While the Lee Gettess product didn't work out for me, the 
John Crane Reversal Day product is proving very insightful 
and was the catalyst for a few successful trades this week. 

I look forward to my morning, evening and weekly extreme 
market updates and I plan to shop at the INO store on many 
occasions in the future to take advantage of the many 
excellent educational opportunities there. 

My 'Portfolio' and 'Quote Board' window allow me to draw a 
much sharper bulls-eye and hit my upside targets with much 
greater accuracy than in the past. I've been trading for a 
few years now and have always enjoyed it, but you've injected 
a new vitality and brought a new life to the markets for me. 

Just yesterday, when exiting a long Bean position for a 
modest but appreciated profit I thanked my broker for 
turning me on to INO.com and I meant it. 

You all are doing a bang-up job and I personally think a 
lot of 'dotcom' start up outfits could do a lot worse than 
to take a look at your approach and the way you cater to 
your clientele. 

Keep up the good work, it's greatly appreciated.

"Enron plans to oppose Dynegy in FERC power issue","A heads up for you gas folks that Enron will be on ComEd's side against Dynegy on this power issue at 
FERC, since EES designates Firm LD contracts as sources on ComEd's network transmission system (Dynegy wants ComEd to only allow ""capacity"" contracts to be used).  We plan to file the Enron response on Friday.

Subject:	Dynegy v. ComEd update

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

Fantasy Football Matchups 

Every Friday our Fantasy experts break down the key Fantasy matchup of the week. It may be a top running back facing a sturdy run defender; a deep-threat wideout matched up with a premier cover-corner; or a gunslinging QB against a defense with ball-hawking safeties. We'll tell you who has the edge. We'll also highlight the key matchups in every NFL game to help you decide who to start and who to bench. Check our Fantasy News area (click News, Fantasy News on the toolbar) Fridays for Fantasy Football Matchups.

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Matt Biggins, Los Angeles, CA 

Which two receivers should I start this weekend, out of Todd Pinkston, Bill Schroeder, Chris Carter, Terry Glenn and James McKnight? Who would you recommend starting out of Duce Staley, Stephen Davis, Ron Dayne, Kevan Barlow and Jason Brookins? 

Answer - GG 

As long as Schroeder (ankle) is healthy, he's a must- start against a Minnesota defense that allowed Charlie Batch to throw for 345 yards and three touchdowns last weekend. Miami has a bye, so McKnight is obviously not an option. Pinkston and Glenn both have good matchups, but we'd have to go with Carter in this case. This season has been very unpredictable, so going with your most established player in this case is the best move. To answer your second question, we'd recommend Davis against a vulnerable Carolina defense and Dayne against Philadelphia. It's tough to choose Davis, but Barlow has a bye and both Staley and Brookins will be splitting carries at best, so our hands are tied. 


Question - Jeff Smith, Tampa, FL 

I have Jeff Garcia, who has a bye this week. I have the option of starting Jim Miller or picking up Chris Weinke. What do you recommend? 

Answer - GG 

Miller has been very inconsistent from a Fantasy perspective, so we'd have to side with Weinke. He'll be facing a Washington defense decimated by injuries and vulnerable to players like Muhsin Muhammad, Donald Hayes and Wesley Walls. Weinke could have a big game. 


Question - Scott Buzby, Newark, DE 

Who should I start this week: Shannon Sharpe or Bubba Franks? Also, is it time to drop James Thrash? Kevin Johnson, Laveranues Coles, Todd Pinkston and Joe Jurevicius are all still available. 

Answer - GG 

Franks has been Brett Favre's favorite target in the red zone, but Sharpe is one of the best tight ends in the league. Sharpe will always give you good production from the tight end spot, and we highly doubt that Franks will be able to continue to score touchdowns at his current pace of one per game. As far as Thrash goes, we feel he's just not good enough to be facing No.1 cornerbacks on a weekly basis, so his numbers will be inconsistent at best. Your best bet is to drop him and go after another No. 1-caliber wideout like Johnson, who could emerge as a reliable Fantasy player. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Phil Brown, St. Louis, MO: When will people start giving Priest Holmes the credit he deserves? He is the best offensive option the Chiefs have, and he even has more rushing yards than Marshall Faulk after five weeks. With Dick Vermeil calling the shots in Kansas City, Holmes will continue to be a productive player all season.

The volume on the hedge will now respect the minimum volume and volume increment settings on the parent product. See rules below: 

?	If the transaction volume on the child is less than half of the parent's minimum volume no hedge will occur.
?	If the transaction volume on the child is more than half the parent's minimum volume but less than half the volume increment on the parent, the hedge will volume will be the parent's minimum volume.
?	For all other volumes, the same rounding rules will apply based on the volume increment on the parent product.

Subject:	Wednesday's P/L

Mike:  Everything in the P/L looks good to me.  I have attached the cover sheet and the reconciliation.  The estimate was off on the gas daily curve shift because Monte Lost connection to Randy's files. This meant that on the estimate, the liquidated day was incorrect.  When I run it, we are much closer (within $20,000), but this is not the # you went home with.  This issue will be resolved tomorrow ensuring that the estimate will be more accurate.  

The next largest item on the reconciliation is the transport model.  There is not one deal that stands out as the culprit.  I need to do some more investigating as to how to improve the transport model estimate.  It may be discounting.  The curves and the spreads are all accurate.


The status of the three items we discussed today are: 

1. I am working away at the new deal model.  Kieth and I are in agreement as to the basic form.
2. I gave you the broker report.; and
3.  Jeff is working with confirmations to get you both the broker confirms and our confirms so that you can sign off on them.
3a. I am also working on the desk to desk physical report.  I was unable to run the report I initially had in mind.  I will let you know.

I am trying very hard to provide the information you need in a timely accurate fashion.  If you have any suggestions as to how Monte and I can improve, please tell me.

See you tomorrow.

Anne

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed off $0.05 at $67.20 today.
Friday's USDA monthly cattle-on-feed report was a mixed bag. The
placements figure was bullish, but the marketings figure was bearish. 

December lean hogs closed off $0.43 today at $49.62. Heavy hog runs
last week weighed on the futures today, as did ideas of steady to
weak cash hog trade on Tuesday. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1 1/4 cents lower at $2.04 1/4
today. Prices dropped to another fresh 3.5-month low today as the
market continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. 

January soybeans closed 2 1/2 cents lower at $4.27 today. Prices hit
a contract low in the January contract today. We had more positive
news on the export front today, in the form of weekly export
inspections being well above expectations. But still, the market
could not rally on that friendly news. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 5 cents at $2.82 today. Prices
were due for a corrective pullback this week after they pushed to a
fresh seven-week high on Friday. Profit taking was featured today
amid weak weekly export inspections figures. 

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 9 points lower at 6.64 cents today.
Prices closed near the session low, but did hit a fresh three-week
high today. Bulls are still gaining confidence, but bears still have
the technical edge, overall. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 135 points lower at 42.50 cents today.
Prices set a contract and record low for nearby futures today. There
is no doubt the bears are in full command of coffee at present. The
only encouraging news to the bulls is the increase in volatility at
these lower price levels. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $23 lower today, at $1,003. Prices again
gapped lower today and scored a new low for the month, and that's
just another bearish clue. A new downtrend line has developed on the
daily bar chart and bears are in command. 

December cotton closed 74 points lower at 29.81 cents today. Reports
said a big ""fund"" sell order hit the market

to drive prices sharply lower. Prices gapped down to a fresh contract
low of 29.60 cents today. That's close to the key 29.50-cent level. 

January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 89.20. That's up
35 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices

scored a bullish ""outside day"" up on Friday and are now very close to
the recent high. The bulls still have the edge. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed off $4.20 today at $276.50
an ounce. More technical damage was done today in gold. Bears are
poised to push prices on down to the $275 area in the near term, or
below. 

December silver futures closed $0.038 lower at $4.235 an ounce today.
Prices hit another fresh five-week low Thursday, and have almost
filled the big upside gap on the daily bar chart that was created in
early September. 

December N.Y. copper closed 15 points higher at 62.50 cents. Prices
today dropped to another fresh contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears
rule. 

ENERGIES: December crude closed unchanged at $22.26 today. Prices
scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart. Prices dropped to
a four-week low just last Thursday. A big bear flag still may be
forming on the daily chart.

December heating oil closed 14 points lower, at .6325 today. Prices
scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar chart today. Prices last
Thursday matched the September low. A big bear flag may still be
forming on the daily bar chart.

December unleaded gasoline closed 27 points higher at .6012 today.
Prices scored a fresh yearly low just last

Thursday. A bearish pennant pattern on the daily bar chart still
could be forming.

December natural gas closed $0.085 higher at $3.075 today. Prices
today pushed to another six-week high and closed near the session
high. Again, the nat gas market had been acting well, given the
recent downturn in liquid energies.

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 73
points lower today at .8907. Prices scored another fresh six-week low
today. Bears are gaining more confidence by the day. 

The December Japanese yen closed off 94 points at .8191 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have control of the yen. 

The December Swiss franc closed 60 points lower at .6036 today. A
steep four-week-old downtrend line remains in place on the daily bar
chart. Importantly, today a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on
the daily bar chart was penetrated on the downside and negated. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 9 points lower at .6329 today.
Significant technical damage has occurred in this currency recently.
Prices are now back down close to the April and September lows. 

The December British pound closed 98 points lower at 1.4202. Prices
fell to a fresh 2.5-month low today. Bears have the edge. Technical
damage has been inflicted recently. First support is now seen at the
1.4100 level. First resistance is now seen at 1.4300. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 92 points higher at 116.10
today. Prices pushed to another fresh five-week high today and the
bulls are really gaining strength. It appears a head-and-shoulders
bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 4/32 higher at 106 13/32. The market
took a ""rest day"" today, after the recent active price action.
Recently, bull could not push prices above very strong resistance
located just above the 107 even. That gives the bears confidence. 

December S&P 500 futures closed up 20.70 at 1093.20. Prices closed
near the session high. Importantly today, prices were not negatively
impacted by the news that two postal workers in Washington, D.C. have
died from likely inhalation anthrax exposure. Many would have thought
that would have spooked the stock market. If prices can push above
last week's high of 1114.50, that would be a very positive
development for the bulls.

 	  	 Dear Mike,

The Washington bureau will bring us more on the EPA decision to recommend changes to the nation's fuel specifications on Thursday. Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook says the proposal to reduce the number of boutique fuels across the country will likely draw mixed reaction. 

We'll have the latest on energy legislation from the Senate. There continues to be mixed signals coming from both parties on the likelihood of a deal that could pave the way for a comprehensive energy bill to reach the floor. 

Also in Washington, a long list of energy influentials will speak at the Alliance to Save Energy's Summit on Energy Efficiency. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman and S. David Freeman, the Chairman of California's new state power authority are among the scheduled participants. We'll have coverage of the Summit from the Washington bureau on Thursday. 

Houston has long been called the energy capital of the world and downtown Houston has always been considered the energy corridor. Now the Woodlands, a community located north of Houston, is staking its claim as the next energy corridor of the area. On Thursday the Woodlands Chamber of Commerce is hosting an energy forum to discuss the area's growth and ways to attract more companies. We'll bring you details from the Houston bureau tomorrow. 

We'll take a rare look Thursday into the largest nuclear power plant in Texas. South Texas Project Electric Generating Station invited members of the news media to tour secured areas as nuclear plants around the country upgrade security in light of the threats and attacks on America. 

Also from the Houston bureau on Thursday, Simmons & Company International Vice President of Research Mark Meyer will drop by to discuss how oil stocks are doing this quarter. Catch Meyer during the 10:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

The California Public Utilities Commission is meeting on Thursday. West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas says the agenda may include the Rate Agreement between the CDWR and the PUC along with the issue of Direct Access. 

Kym also reports, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District is boosting its capacity. This move will add to what is already the largest utility-owned distributed photovoltaic system in the world. Kym will bring us details on Thursday. 

Finally from the West Coast bureau, we'll have comments from California Governor Gray Davis' Press Secretary Steve Maviglio on the federal government's plans to expand Path 15. Join us for these stories from the West Coast bureau tomorrow. 

From ENL Headquarters on Thursday, Williams Energy Partners L.P. Chief Financial Officer Don Wellendorf will join us to discuss the company's third-quarter earnings. And Edward Jones Senior Energy Analyst Zach Wagner will join us from St. Louis to continue the discussion on earnings. Wagner will discuss Enron during the 4:00 p.m. ET newscast tomorrow. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stret! ch! .

Trent Dilfer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck fr! om! a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige0! 1&! owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori U! pd! ated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate h! im! . He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries l! at! e in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football222! .f! antasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key! =1! 87503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was ab! le! to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=486&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

 	  	 Dear Mike,

I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts. 

On Monday, International Correspondent Wolfgang Vale will be live from the 18th World Energy Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The focal theme this year is ""Energy markets: The challenges of the new millennium."" Catch live reports from the first day of the 18th World Energy Congress on Monday. 

Congress returns to Washington Monday amid continuing concern over the anthrax threat on Capitol Hill. Both the House and Senate are expected to resume their normal schedule, which includes some action on energy. There are hearings scheduled on the Price Anderson Act, reducing vehicle fuel consumption and MTBE. The main action, however, will be behind the scenes in the Senate where Republicans and Democrats still differ on whether there's time to consider a comprehensive energy bill this year. We'll bring you more details next week. 

A summit on energy efficiency is also taking place next week from Washington. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, Senate Energy Chairman Jeff Bingaman (D)-New Mexico and Representative 
Ed Markey (D)-Massachusetts will be among the speakers at the event. We'll have all the details from the summit next week. 

Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us a report Monday on Texas wind power projects. Kim says federal and state laws helped get the idea off the ground, and now demand for wind power is allowing the market to do very well. Kim will have all the details of wind generation success in Texas on Monday. 

The Houston bureau will also have a report on how refiners will keep gasoline inventories well supplied once MTBE is phased out. Right now, MTBE makes up 10 percent of the U.S. gasoline pool. Once the blending component is banned, refiners will look to isooctane to help supplement gasoline supplies. Jacobs Consultancy's Dan Foley will talk about the role of isooctane on Monday. 

Former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz tells West Coast Correspondent Kym McNicholas, California's energy supply crisis is understandable, but the financial crisis is not. Kym also talks one-on-one with former California Governor Pete Wilson. He gives a reflective look into what went wrong with the state's deregulation plan and what the state needs to do to recover. 

With earnings expected out October 31st, Calpine Corporation CEO Peter Cartwright will talk about his company's growth this quarter compared to this time last year. He also reacts to word the state may attempt to renegotiate long-term power contracts. We'll bring you details from the West Coast bureau on Monday. 

Get the streamers and balloons ready - Energy News Live is turning one. You'll want to be sure to log on Tuesday, October 23rd, because in celebration of ENL's one-year anniversary we've scheduled a 
star-studded cast of energy industry guests. Here's a little preview: 

Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, Ph.D. 
Energy Daily Publisher Llewellyn King 
FirstCall Director of Research Chuck Hill 
Platts Global Director of Oil John Kingston 
Petroleum Argus, Inc. President Dan Massey 
American Association of Petroleum Geologists Director Rick Fritz

Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury.

Latest NFL Player News 

Patrick Jeffers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=1515&>, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Jeffers hopes to return to the field for the first time in 14 months when the Panthers play host the New York Jets on Sunday. Jeffers, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee during in a preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2000, said he's been told by the coaching staff that he'll be activated Sunday for the first time this season. ""They said it looks like I'll be up, so I'm preparing like I will be,"" Jeffers said. ""I'm excited. It's another step along the way."" Keep Jeffers reserved for now. He will see limited action if plays. 

Ryan Leaf  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=12506&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Leaf will be the Cowboys' backup QB Sunday. Clint Stoerner has been named the starter in place of the injured Anthony Wright. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/26/01 
Stoerner will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against Arizona on Sunday, replacing Anthony Wright, who is out with a chronic sprained knee and could face season-ending surgery. We wouldn't advise using Stoerner as the starting QB on your Fantasy squad. He has played just three games in his two seasons with Dallas, but was 4-of-7 for 44 yards and two touchdowns against Philadelphia this year. Ryan Leaf will be the No. 2 quarterback for Dallas. 

Edgerrin James  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=133320&>, RB IND - TexOK Updated 10/26/01 
James hyperextended his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game but said his knee should be fine for the Colts' next game on November 4. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=1191&>, WR KC - Top Dogs Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=263&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy.

For all gas basis curves, if it does not have its own vol, then NG Nymex Vol will be used.

Winston,
Bharat meet with Francis Lim regarding ERMS and he learned that NGI-MALIN does not have any vol curve assigned to it.  However when we simulate that curve in ad hoc we don't get any errors.  Can you tell us what vol curve is being used for NGI-Malin in risk trac?
Thanks

To remain consistent with Enron's directive to improve security access to the building, all Enron Body Shop members are required to check-in at the Body Shop Front Desk and present an Enron Photo ID badge or another form of Photo ID to the Security Officer each time you visit.  To assist our members who participate in outdoor activities during their visit, Security SMART ID tags are available at the Body Shop Front Desk for your convenience.  Simply slide the SMART ID tag through the shoe laces between an eyelet and snap the tag closed.  

The SMART ID tags serve both as a safety identification tag while members are exercising off property as well as provide the security identification verification required when entering the Body Shop.  Each day you plan to exercise outside, present your Enron Photo ID Badge or another form of Photo ID to the Front Desk Receptionist to receive your temporary Security SMART ID.  Your Photo ID will be returned to you when you return the SMART ID tag to the Front Desk at the end of your visit.

"Jeff McMahon Named CFO","
Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

"","I agree with everything in your summary except for of course the ridiculous parenthesis part in #2. But, as for rooting on the horns come Friday I cannot go along. From birth I have been conditioned to hate the Texas Longhorns. When I moved to the state of Texas at the age of 4 this emotion became so firmly ingrained in every fiber of my being that it is impossible for me to ever root for the horns. I can think of no circumstance in which I would ever root, cheer, or applaud the Texas Longhorns in any sporting event. I was even rooting for those faggy Europeans to beat Longhorn Lance Armstrong in that bicycle thingy-majig last year in France. So, yes, Friday morning I will be rooting that the horns embarrass themselves on national TV, that Chrissy is the laughing stock of the nation, and that the fake military and their brainwashed fans party the night away in that one horse town of College Station. If that happens my left-over turkey will taste that much better and if not the Sooners gain valuable bonus points. Either way, I win.

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Sounds good.

I called the other day to find out what URL you use for the streaming Bloomberg TV screen you have at your desk. Can you e-mail it to me?

  John,

  Thank you for the spreadsheet.  I will sit down and plug in my numbers after Thanksgiving.  Have a nice weekend.

  Talk to you soon.

    Mike - here is the spreadsheet I have used. You need to fill in the cells in yellow for starting values, the spreadsheet calculates the rest. You can also change the assumptions at the top (blue cells). Mortgage expenses are captured in line 33 but do not include taxes and insurance, just P&I. Make sure to include taxes and insurance in general annual expenses (line 47). 

    Just take a look and fill it in as well as you can and we can talk about any questions you have.

"RE:","I just asked Phil -

He said that Mexican has not found the supply yet.  He told me that they are having problems finding the suppy, but he did not give me details.  Both Stephanie and Phil are talking with Mexican and they know the specifics from Mexican.

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

"P&L estimates","Good morning,

In an effort to smooth out some of the problems we have seen in the past, I would like to start getting a P&L estimate from each of you nightly to try to prevent any unnecessary surprises in the mornings.  I will then expect my group to contact you before they leave at night if it is above or below your estimates, or range you give them.  

This will certainly help us all avoid any fire drills the next day. 

If you have any concerns about this please let me know, otherwise, your book admins will be calling you or stopping by your desks around 3:00 daily to get this estimate. 

Thanks,
Kam

"FW: MBA Resume","Mike and Joe,

Is Enron or Reliant looking for any traders?  Mike Cook used to be a
semi-pro hockey player.  I am sure he can handle his own on the trading
floor (ie - kick your ass).

He is going to be in town next week.  Are either of you up to letting
him come by and introduce himself?

Thanks,
Curtis

Dear Curtis, 

Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
enough 
to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
school at 
the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
My 
concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
Energy 
industry, either as a trader or broker.  

As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be

looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
figured 
that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
to help 
me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
be able 
to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  

I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
hire.  
If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
will be 
in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
for our 
school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
a 
beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely, 

Mike Cook

"Important Announcement Regarding Document Preservation","
As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

"FW: Wishing you well","
As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major sco! ri! ng threat even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1599&>, QB KC - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com! /m! p/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

! Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235249&>, RB SD - Hunter Updated 10/21/01
! Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12409&>, QB DEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sun! da! y's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187401&>, WR CIN - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Frank Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235247! &>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 yards against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game.

Anthony Thomas <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Matty Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit! . ! Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver. 

Charlie Batch <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.! 
Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick tight end for the remainder of the year.

Albert Connell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1851&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1234&>, WR NO - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not ca! pa! ble of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Anthony Becht <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players=! ag! ue=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St. Louis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=1152&>, RB PIT - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=798&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, p! os! ting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

My position in NCD is not matching the reports issued to Lavo.  Monte is showing 233 lots long intra and the report is showing 413.  See if you can find the difference.

He threw the ball during individual drills Friday, and according to published reports, is likely to play despite not being 100 percent. We don't recommend McNair this week as a result.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1094&""><B>Emmitt Smith</B></A>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Smith will return to the lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprained right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Friday's practice that Smith would ""be ready to play the majority of the game."" His return bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1184&""><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury report on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Detroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger league this week, Sanders' matchup against a vulnerable Detroit secondary is worth considering as long as he's able to play.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>!

The veteran has a knack for finding the end zone, and should have a good game against rookie CB Will Allen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against the N.Y.

Brooks had a big game against San Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1234&""><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/16/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson put up a huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnerable to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2762&key=1440&""><B>Stephen Davis</B></A>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Up!

_____________________________________________________________________

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed up $0.65 at $67.95 today. The
big rally in the hogs supported the cattle futures today, as did
short covering. Prices scored a mildly bullish ""outside day"" up on
the daily bar chart today--whereby the high was higher and the low
was lower than the previous session's trading range, with a higher
close. 

December lean hogs closed up $1.80 today at $49.65. A bullish monthly
USDA hogs and pigs report Friday-- showing a smaller pig crop than
last year--boosted futures sharply higher today. Ideas this week's
kill will be less than last week's also lent strength to futures
prices today. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 cents lower at $2.03 1/2
today. Prices dropped to a fresh contract low today on fund selling.
The market feels pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. After
today's decline, I don't think there's much downside left in corn. 

January soybeans closed unchanged at $4.34 1/4 today. More solid
export demand, in the form of strong weekly export inspections data
today, failed to push the market higher. While prices could retest
the contract lows scored last week, or even drop below them, I do
think the downside from present price levels is limited. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 3 3/4 cents at $2.91 1/4 today.
Prices backed off today on some profit

taking from the recent gains, and no chart damage was done today.
Prices Friday hit a fresh three-month high. 

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 5 points higher at 6.77 cents today.
Prices closed near the session high. A fledging three-week-old
uptrend line is still intact on the daily bar chart--but just barely.
Bears still have the technical edge, overall. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 25 points higher at 43.65 cents today.
Not much fresh news. The bears are in full command of coffee at
present. The only encouraging news to the bulls is the recent
increase in volatility at these lower price levels. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $2 higher today, at $997. There was enough
follow-through buying today to confirm a bullish key reversal on the
daily bar chart. 

December cotton closed 8 points higher at 28.94 cents in

quiet trading today. Prices last week dropped down below key
long-term support at 29.50 cents. This opens the door to declines to
the 26-cent area, which is the lows seen in 1972, basis nearby
futures. 

January orange juice on Friday afternoon closed at 90.65. That's up
155 points from the Thursday evening close. Prices gapped higher
Friday and bulls still have the big edge. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $1.40 at $279.70 an
ounce today. The weaker U.S. dollar helped the yellow metal today.
Prices are still seeing a corrective bounce in a bear market, but
bulls will take what they can get at present. 

December silver futures closed $0.028 higher at $4.243 an ounce
today. Prices hit a fresh five-week low last week and bears have the
big edge. 

December N.Y. copper closed 40 points lower at 63.10 cents. Prices
last week dropped to a contract low of 62.00 cents. Bears rule.

ENERGIES: December crude closed $0.10 higher at $22.15 today. It was
a fairly quiet day. The daily chart still looks bearish. However, the
longer the market trades sideways, the more that favors the bulls and
some ""basing"" activity. 

December heating oil closed 33 points higher at .6337 today. It was a
quiet day today. The daily chart still looks bearish as prices hover
not that far above the recent lows. 

December unleaded gasoline closed 8 points lower at .5873 today.
Prices scored a mildly bearish ""outside day"" down on the daily bar
chart today. The daily chart still looks

bearish.

December natural gas closed $0.177 higher at $3.36 today. 

Prices scored a fresh seven-week high today. Prices last

week pushed up above a longer-term downtrend line on the daily bar
chart and today it was negated. 

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 125
points higher today at .9018. Bulls needed a day like today after the
bears knocked them around recently. Bears remain in control. 

The December Japanese yen closed up 52 points at .8218 today. Today
saw a rebound in a bear market and bears rule. Prices pushed to a
three-month low last week. 

The December Swiss franc closed 91 points higher at .6134 today.
Bulls needed today after their recent whipping. A steep five-week-old
downtrend line on the daily bar chart was penetrated on the upside
and negated today. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 13 points higher at

.6351 today. Bears still rule as prices are in a four-month-old
downtrend on the daily bar chart. 

The December British pound closed up 164 points at 1.4486 today.
Today's big gains negated a three-week-old downtrend line on the
daily bar chart and puts the bulls and bears back on a level playing
field, overall. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 119 points lower at

114.71 today. Prices gapped lower on the daily bar chart today and
they closed near the session low. Technical damage was done with
today's big downmove. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 10/32 higher at 108 1/32. The

bulls continue their push north as a new for-the-move

high was set today. Prices are at lofty levels, but there is nothing
on the daily chart that suggests prices cannot go farther north. 

December S&P 500 futures closed off 28.50 at 1,073.50. Prices closed
near the session low today as trading has turned sideways and
choppier. Poor earnings reports, a weaker economic picture and an
increasing anthrax scare will limit upside moves.

Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football 
Newsletter! The newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox

PLAN FOR THE PLAYOFFS

The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, 
with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)

If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule,

THE GRIDIRON GURU

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions 
about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We 
invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on 
players to: gridguru@commissioner.com. You'll get the chance 
to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like 
yourself! 


Mike Blake: I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. 
Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin 
Muhammad in week ten? 

G.G. - Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston 
has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing 
playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from 
a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last 
weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success 
against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with 
Muhammad. 

Russell Brown: My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one 
of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady, 
Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.   

G.G. - Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this 
season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie 
struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and 
won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest 
playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the 
return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in 
his last five games, and is playing too well to bench. 

Chris Gilcrest: Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich 
Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would 
you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson, 
Curtis Martin?  

G.G. - Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but 
he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like 
Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar 
performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a 
solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike 
Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the 
matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three 
games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his 
struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit 
is too good to ignore.

TIP OF THE WEEK

Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay 
healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his 
solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to 
another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best 
Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an 
unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Plan for the Playoffs
</font></b><p><font face=""Arial"" size=""2""> 
<!-- First tip text goes here -->
The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are
on the horizon. For <b>Fantasy 2001</b> players, the playoffs begin
with NFL week 15 (games of <b>Dec. 22-23</b>) and last two weeks,
with the championship game in week 16 (games of <b>Dec. 29-30</b>.)<p>

If you're in a <b>Football Commissioner</b> league, go to <b><i>Schedule,
Playoffs</i></b> to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds
they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not
determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets.
The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding
the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your
regular season.<p>

If your team is still in contention, go to
<b><i>NFL Teams, Schedule</i></b> and take note of the NFL teams with byes
during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be
available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff
matchup.

"New Deal Check out Model","Keith:  I made a ton of progress on the NewDeal Model over the weekend and tonight. I resolved all of the issues we discussed on Friday.  In other words all of the positions pull from the hedge strips correctly, and the EOL data pulls in correctly.  I am working on the other tabs that we will need, including the New Broker deals and New EOL tabs.  The data is all there, I just need to get it to display in the common format.

Can you schedule 30 minutes after trading on Tuesday to discuss.  I will have a model for you to test.

Despite his quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=192266&""><B>Jason Brookins</B></A>, RB BAL - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble.

The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego?s 20-17 loss. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=12375&""><B>Doug Flutie</B></A>, QB SD - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona.

ON!
T><BR>
<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=133230&""><B>David Boston</B></A>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. He?s one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1234&""><B>Willie Jackson</B></A>, WR NO - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Jackson had !
a !
good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1511&""><B>Joe Horn</B></A>, WR NO - Matty <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against New England. He?s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1140&""><B>Tyrone Wheatley</B></A>, RB OAK - Giggles <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New Orleans.

NT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He?s become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots? bench for another week.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1034&""><B>Rich Gannon</B></A>, QB OAK - Martin <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1184&""><B>Frank Sanders</B></A>, WR ARI - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Hel!

Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a hamstring injury.

He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a mediocre performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1011&""><B>Alex Van Pelt</B></A>, QB BUF - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FA!

=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one interception.

He did not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=12363&""><B>Jay Fiedler</B></A>, QB MIA - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=133361&""><B>Donovan McNabb</B></A>, QB PHI - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet performance.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1859&""><B>James Thrash</B></A>, WR PHI - Frank <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington.

consistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=235213&""><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1089&""><B>Ki-Jana Carter</B></A>, RB WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1762&""><B>Isaac Byrd</B></A>, WR CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday.

Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=734&key=1191&""><B>Derrick Alexander</B></A>, WR KC - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 11/25/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.

"Natural Gas Origination","
Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Please place her at 60 or below.  She is under a performance review plan and has been removed from Trading Track.  

Zack McCarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago.  Do we need to add him to the list?

Thanks,

"Forbes Article-Gas Fired Power Plants","Don't know if you saw this already.  Interesting.

Ken

Indigestion 
Daniel Fisher, Forbes Magazine, 10.29.01 

All those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand, right? Maybe not.
For natural gas bulls, there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at General Electric Corp. Backlogs in GE's Power Systems group almost tripled to $25 billion in the late 1990s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nation's growing appetite for electricity. Gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. 

Ah, but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below $2 per million Btu at the wellhead from as high as $10 last year. (A million Btu of gas equals just about 1,000 cubic feet.) Those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units, which still supply half the nation's electricity. But in a painstaking study of 788 power plants that supply the bulk of U.S. electricity, Charles Studness, president of Studness Research, found quite the opposite could happen. 

Studness determined that 79% of the ""new"" electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants, mostly coal-fired units. And there's plenty more where that came from. Studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by 50 million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years, representing about half the expected 2.5%-a-year increase in demand. 

Coal's advantage over gas: It's cheap. Utilities paid an average of $1.20 per million Btu for coal last year, compared with $4.30 for gas (delivered). Even with depressed gas prices, many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. So while those new turbines being installed by Calpine (nyse: CPN - news - people) and other independent power producers, (see table, below) will burn a lot of gas, they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much. 

 
Addressing a Burning Issue 
If natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn, trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. Overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  
  

WINNERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Calpine 				$4.6 		Its gas power plants won't compete with coal for years 
Chesapeake Energy 		0.9 		Hedged gas production through December 2003 
Dynegy 			43.4 		Owns gas, coal power plants; stores, trades gas 
Peabody Energy 		2.7 		World's largest coal company 

LOSERS  			Sales* ($bil) 	Remarks 
Devon Energy 			3.3 Gas-heavy; 	$8 billion in ...debt  
General Electric 		129.5 		Sells gas turbines 
Pioneer Natural Resources 	1.0 		$1.5 billion in ...debt; 53% of production is gas 
Transocean SedcoForex 	1.9 		$4 billion in debt; heavy gas-drilling exposure 
   
*Latest 12 months. Source: Market Guide via FactSet Research Systems. 

""It's not our game to compete with coal or nuclear,"" says Ron A. Walter, senior vice president of San Jose, Calif.-based Calpine, which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling 31,500 megawatts. ""It's our game to displace older gas."" 

Combined-cycle gas turbines, which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one, can transform 6,800 Btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity, enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. The oldest gas plants burn as much as 13,000 Btu, and the national average is 10,500. Substitute enough new plants for old, and U.S. gas consumption, currently 62 billion cubic feet a day, could drop by as much as 1 billion cubic feet a day. 

That scenario sounds unlikely to Stephen Bergstrom, president of Houston-based Dynegy, an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. Dynegy's 35-year-old coal plants are ""huge capital hogs,"" Bergstrom says, that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. Throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls, and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down, Bergstrom says. 

But coal-plant owners can be ingenious. Witness Midwest Generation, a nonregulated subsidiary of Edison International that bought six coal plants from troubled Commonwealth Edison of Chicago in 1999. By changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal, Midwest boosted output from the 40-year-old plants 12% last year--while reducing emissions. John Long, vice president and chief technical officer of the Midwest Generation unit, thinks he can coax another 15% increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. 

Long term, the bullish scenario still holds: Gas will displace coal. In the meantime, gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.

"FW: Griffith Sales","As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

"Thursday AM Ernst update","I'm sorry for those of you on the email list for the first time, but my goal
yesterday was to get the word out and trust it would be passed along to
those people I missed.  So, to everyone who gets this, please forward to
anyone not included here that knows Richard Ernst.  Kristin apologizes for
not contacting many of you personally, but everything has happened so fast
there simply hasn't been time.

A recap for our newcomers:
Last Saturday, Richard began having sever headaches that were soon
accompanied by blurred vision.  He went to the hospital on Monday, and the
doctors diagnosed a brain aneurysm.  He had surgery on Monday night, and the
doctors discovered there was no aneurysm (blood clot) but rather
hemorrhaging.

The update:
Richard had an MRI last night, and the doctors found a tumor on the lower
back side of his brain, near the section where the brain meets the spinal
column.  It's about the size of a key lime, and apparently was causing the
hemorrhaging.  Although this is certainly not what anyone hoped to see in
the MRI, it is in a very operable location.  He is being treated now with
steroids to reduce the swelling, and remains on some heavy duty pain
killers, including morphine.

There is no immediate threat to his life, as the doctors said he could wait
as long as two weeks to have surgery, but Richard wants to get it done
sooner, so he is scheduled to under the knife again on Monday.  He is in a
lot of pain.  They won't know until the operation whether or not the tumor
is malignant.

He is in the ICU at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio (7700 Floyd Curl Dr)
and unable to accept flowers or gifts, but if you want to send something,
his home address is: 243 E. Elmview, SA, TX 78209.  Since the operation
isn't until Monday, the Ernst's are just killing time, and they welcome
visitors.  If anyone wants to come to San Antonio this weekend, they would
be happy to see you.

I just called and spoke to him, and he sounds pretty good.  He said the
nurses haven't been ""poking or prodding"" at him as much, so that has been
nice.  I am going to visit him this afternoon, so if anyone wants to send
him a message, email it to me before lunch, and I'll print it out and take
it to him personally.

That's all I can think of right now, and please forward this email.

Remember the Ernst family in your prayers.

John Shepperd

He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws.

Hayes may step back into the forefront this week as the No. 1 wideout in place of Muhsin Muhammad.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed lower on Wednesday due to profit taking as they
extended Tuesday?s losses. The NASDAQ closed lower for the second day
in a row however, a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered
some of today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on
Friday. If this week?s decline continues, trendline support crossing
near 1816.25 is a possible target later this month. Closes below this
fall?s uptrend line would confirm that this fall?s rally has come to
an end. The December S&P 500 index also closed lower on Wednesday as
it extended profit taking that began on Tuesday. December closed just
below the 50% retracement level of this summer?s decline crossing at
1137.45 today. Closes below last Friday?s low at 1130.50 could lead
to a test of this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 1110.50 later
this year. Momentum indicators are overbought warning investors that
additional long-liquidation is possible into the end of November.

The Dow closed lower on Wednesday due to profit taking ahead of the
Thanksgiving Day holiday. Ideas that this fall?s rebound might have
been too much too fast is causing investors to look hard at their
portfolio?s as they might want to lock in profits ahead of the
upcoming Christmas season. This morning?s consumer confidence report
showed improvement for the second month in a row, which had little
effect on investors today. If today?s setback continues, broken fib
resistance crossing at 9706.20 is a possible target later this month. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December T-bonds renewed its decline off November?s high and broke
out below the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing
at 104-29. Today?s close into new lows for the week sets the stage
for a likely test of September?s low crossing at 102-17 later this
month. A short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of
today?s losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Momentum indicators remain bearish signaling that additional weakness
is possible into the end of November. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Wednesday as it spiked above last
week?s high before profit taking tempered some of today?s gains.
Strength in energies, grains, fiber and some foods underpinned
today?s rally. If this fall?s rebound continues, trendline resistance
crossing near 191.87 is the CRB?s next target. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a major bottom and trend
change has taken place. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed slightly lower on Wednesday in light
pre-holiday trading as they consolidated some of this week?s short
covering gains. Traders continue to mull over comments from OPEC and
non-OPEC nations for a clue on whether or not they will reach an
agreement to cut production.

January crude oil closed slightly lower as it posted a quiet inside
day on Wednesday to consolidate recent gains. If this week?s rebound
continues, fib resistance crossing at 20.02 is Jan.?s next target.
Momentum indicators have turned bullish signaling that sideways to
higher prices are possible into early-December.

December heating oil posted an inside day with a lower close on
Wednesday as it consolidated some of its recent gains. However,
momentum indicators are turning bullish signaling that Monday?s low
marked a short-term bottom. If this week?s rebound continues, fib
resistance crossing at 58.36 is December?s next target. 

December unleaded gas closed slightly lower on Wednesday in choppy
trading. If this week?s rebound continues, fib resistance crossing at
55.55 is December?s next target. Momentum indicators have turned
bullish increasing the odds that a short-term top has likely been
posted. 

December Henry Hub natural gas closed lower on Wednesday following
the release of this week?s AGA inventory report. The report showed a
build of 15 bcf this past week, which was termed bearish. However,
short-term momentum indicators are turning bullish hinting that a
double bottom has likely been posted. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar erased Tuesday?s loss and closed into new highs
thereby confirming the recent breakout above trading range
resistance. December is poised to test the 62% retracement level of
this summer's decline crossing at 117.79 in the near future. Momentum
indicators are bullish but becoming overbought but have not confirmed
a top is in place. 

The December Swiss Franc closed lower on Wednesday due to light
profit taking as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s gains. However,
closes above trendline resistance crossing near .6136 are needed to
confirm a bottom. Momentum indicators are turning neutral to bullish
hinting that sideways to higher prices are possible into
early-December.

The December Canadian Dollar extended Tuesday?s decline and is poised
to retest this month?s low at .6230 in the near future. If the
decline resumes, .6200 is a potential target later this year. A
number of momentum indicators are turning bearish with today?s
decline signaling that additional weakness is possible near-term. 

The December Japanese Yen posted a downside reversal on Wednesday
thereby ending Tuesday?s short covering bounce. If the decline
resumes, July?s low crossing at .8060 is a potential target later
this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that
sideways to lower prices are possible near-term.

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold closed slightly lower on Wednesday ended above August?s
reaction low crossing at 272.60. Closes below this key support level
would open the door for a possible test of this summer?s crossing at
268.40 later this year. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling
that additional weakness is possible into the end of November. 

December silver posted a new contract low on Wednesday as it broke
out below key support crossing at 4.055 cents. The door is open for a
test of weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this year. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible near-term. 

December copper posted a key reversal up on Wednesday. However,
today?s mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading
when the market reopens after Thanksgiving. Closes above 69.60 or
below 66.70 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

March corn closed steady on Wednesday as it consolidates below the
bottom of October?s gap crossing at 2.21 1/2. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to extend March?s rebound off this
month?s low and set the stage for a possible test of this summer?s
downtrend line crossing near 2.25. Closes above this downtrend line
are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has taken place.
Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are possible into the end of November. 

March wheat closed fractionally higher on Wednesday as early strength
due to short covering faded ahead of the close. Today?s low-range
close leaves the door open for sideways to lower prices on Friday.
Until export demand improves, upside potential appears limited into
the end of the year. Stochastics and the RSI have turned bullish
signaling that a test of October?s high at 3.03 is still possible by
the end of the year. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans posted an inside day with a higher close on
Wednesday due to short covering as it consolidated some of Tuesday?s
loss. Friday?s export sales report holds the key as to how January
will close out the week. Thin holiday trading volume could lead to
exaggerated moves in Friday?s shortened session. Closes above this
week?s high at 4.54 3/4 or below this fall?s shallow uptrend line,
which crosses near 4.42 1/2 are needed to clear up near-term
direction in the market. Momentum indicators are overbought and
turned bearish while weekly momentum indicators suggest that
additional short covering gains are possible into the end of the
year. 

January soybean meal closed higher on Wednesday due to short covering
following Tuesday?s above mid-range close. January finished the day
near mid-range leaving the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Momentum indicators have turned bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are likely into early-December. January remains locked
in a sideways pattern, as closes above 162 or below 154.40 are needed
to confirm a trading range breakout and point the direction of the
next trending move. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

February hogs closed lower on Wednesday following Tuesday?s bearish
monthly cold storage report. However, a short covering bounce ahead
of the close tempered some of today?s losses leaving the door open
for sideways trading on Friday. Momentum indicators are turning
neutral to bearish hinting that sideways to lower prices are possible
into early- December.

February cattle closed steady on Wednesday and remain poised to test
this fall?s downtrend line crossing near 70.30. Closes above this
resistance level are needed to confirm a bottom and trend change has
taken place. Stochastics and the RSI are bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into early-December. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

March coffee closed higher on Wednesday in choppy trading as it
extended Tuesday?s short covering bounce. Closes above 53.00 or below
this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 48.60 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market. Short-term momentum indicators
remain bearish warning bullish traders to use caution, as the market
remains vulnerable to additional weakness near-term.

March cocoa closed lower on Wednesday as it continues to consolidate
some of this month?s impressive gains. This week?s setback appears to
be nothing more than a retest of broken resistance crossing at 1257.
Closes above 1297 would confirm this week?s breakout and open the
door for a possible test of the March 1999 reaction high crossing at
1341 later this year. The daily ADX is bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of November. 

March sugar posted a key reversal up on Wednesday but fell just short
of testing the 50% retracement level of the June/October decline
crossing at 755. Additional strength is needed to confirm today?s
bullish reversal pattern. If this fall?s rally continues, September?s
reaction high crossing at 780 is a potential target later this year.
The daily ADX has entered a bullish trend mode signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible into the end of the year.

March cotton closed slightly higher on Wednesday due to improving
world cotton prices. March needs to close above 37.40 or below 35.00
to clear up near-term direction in the market. If this fall?s
short-covering rally resumes, the 50% retracement level of the
July/October decline crossing at 37.88 is March?s next target.
Momentum indicators are bullish but overbought warning bullish
traders to use caution.

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Everyone bring your Palm Pilots to help Lum keep up with all of the phone

"Holiday Party - Canceled","
I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

      <p>Dear Mike,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Mike Grigsby"" <Mike.Grigsby@enron.com>, who belongs to

<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>We're going to make it through the winter - the <b>North American
Electric Reliability Council released its Winter Assessment</b> on
Tuesday, reporting that generating supply should <b>meet or exceed</b>
estimated energy consumption.  The Washington bureau will take a closer
look at the assessment on Wednesday.
<p>On Wednesday, <b>Interior Secretary Gale Norton</b> talks about the
upcoming <b>Lease Area 181 sale</b>.  Secretary Norton believes there's
still great interest in the sale despite the reduction in size of the
lease area.  The sale is scheduled to take place in New Orleans on
December 5.
<p>The <b>FERC announced sweeping changes on Tuesday</b> in how it looks
at the issue of market power.  The changes could have a big impact on
major power generators.  We'll have reaction from the Washington bureau
on Wednesday from <b><i>Megawatt Daily</i> Editor Michael Lustig and

Latest NFL Player News

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by! r! ookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?scrip! t=! players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football210.fan! ta! sy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1035&>, QB BAL - TexOK Updat! ed! 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12411&>, WR STL - Metz Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

T! ru! ng Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1292&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1109&>, RB STL - Grigsby Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Terrell ! wi! ll not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1282&>, WR ATL - TexOK Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1183&>, WR ARI - FJS Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season game this season.! M! oore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Grigsby Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&ow! ne! r=96876.9&random=2792&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week Seve! n.! 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=2792&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy told the! St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

He is expected to participate in practice. <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12342&>Eddie George <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Tori Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Martin Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/! el! ink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1306&> , WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Martin Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football22! 2.! fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1035&>, QB BAL - Tori Updated 10/23/01
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12411&>, WR STL - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung Canidate <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&k! ey! =187503&>, RB STL - Giggles Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1292&>, WR SF - Matty Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was a! bl! e to get treatment every day,"" Stokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Russell Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and could be back in the Giants' starting lineup within the next few weeks. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/! 0! 1
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1109&>, RB STL - Matty Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Anthony Wright <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Age! nt! Updated 10/23/01
Wright is expected to start Sunday's game against Arizona despite swelling in his right knee. Ryan Leaf could see some action in the game, however, so starting Wright from a Fantasy perspective isn't advisable. 

Dez White <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=187682&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the Chicago Sun-Times, White will start in place of the injured Marcus Robinson. White has struggled with his ball-catching abilities, however, so be cautious in picking him up outside of deeper leagues. 

David Terrell <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
! Terrell will not start at wide receiver in place of the injured Marcus Robinson, as was reportedly earlier. The Chicago Sun-Times is now reporting that Dez White will start in place of Robinson, with Terrell being used as the team's third receiver. 

Tony Martin <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1282&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Martin will have an X-ray on his broken right collarbone this week. The team feels confident that Martin will be available for their Nov. 11 game against Dallas, so Fantasy owners should keep him on reserve until then. 

Rob Moore <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1183&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 10/23/01
According to Cardinals coach Dave McGinnis, Moore may not play a regular season! g! ame this season. Moore, who has been dealing with a hamstring injury, continues to have setbacks in his recovery. ""I was hoping we'd see him by now, McGinnis told the Arizona Republic. ""That's why we both handled it like we did in training camp and we paced him. We were planning to have him from the start. I can't tell you when he'll be back. Until he can practice for a couple of weeks, we won't have him."" If Moore is still on your Fantasy roster, now is the time to let him go. 

Tiki Barber <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1782&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/22/01
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Richard Huntley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&leag! ue! =bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1456&>, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Panthers Head Coach George Seifert said Monday that Huntley will enter Week Seven as the team's starting tailback. ""He has progressed from the standpoint that he is now healthy,"" said Seifert. ""Here's a golden opportunity."" See if Huntley is still available in your league, as he looks to be the first player given a shot to claim the Carolina starting RB job.

Jacquez Green <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=12405&>, WR TB - Free Agent Updated 10/22/01
Green suffered a left hip sprain during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. The injury will prevent him from practicing much this week, and could keep him out of next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Monitor Green's progress during the week before deciding whether to use him in Week! S! even.

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/22/01
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Warrick Dunn <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 10/22/01
Dunn suffered a strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Pittsburgh. ""I don't know what kind of situation we're going to be in,"" Bucs Head Coach Tony Dungy! t! old the St. Petersburg Times . ""Warrick pulled a muscle, and he may be out a little while. So I don't know who it'll be carrying the load."" Dunn's backup, Aaron Stecker, is also injured, so be careful considering starting any Tampa Bay running backs in Week Seven.

Brett Favre <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/22/01
Favre injured his right elbow in the final seconds of Sunday's game at Minnesota. Fortunately, the Packers have a bye week in Week Seven, so he should have time to recover. ""It'll be OK,"" Favre told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. ""Thank goodness I have a week to relax. I think that will help.""

James Stewart <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=1886&key=1116&>, RB DET ! -! Hunter Updated 10/22/01
Stewart left Sunday's game against Tennessee in the fourth quarter with a sprained right ankle. He is listed as day to day, and Lamont Warren finished the game in his absence.

Hi Aaron,
I may not be able to get to this WestRateSheet until Mid November because I may be taking 2 week family leave starting this wednesday to care for my son.

I apologize for the delay.

 This is the excel sheet that is linked to EOL Listen or we would like to be linked to EOL Listen that hopefully we can make a web page out of so that it can be posted on the plasma screen.

"URGENT - ENA Associates & Analysts"," 
All,

The below Analyst & Associate recruiting dates require ENA participation at Manager level at above.   In order to resource each of your departments it is important to have ENA's involvement and participation in the interviews and debrief sessions on Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday events.     These de-brief sessions will allow you the opportunity to select candidates you wish to join your groups.  The target  is to assign potential candidates to business units and departments from the outset.

As ENA has the highest percentage of A&A rotating in its business unit, the participation of ENA at interview should reflect this.     Therefore, please encourage your direct reports and managers to participate in the below events in order to secure candidates for your business area.


Associate Recruiting:		Saturday November 3						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview
Analyst Recruiting:		Friday, November 16						Total - 70 Candidates for Interivew
Associate Recruiting:		Saturday, December 1						Total - 70 Candidates for Interview

The above spreadsheet represents ENA's particpation today which I believe highlights the need for much additional support in these efforts.

Please confirm by return participation of your respective groups.

Regards,

Karen Buckley
HR - ENA

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang


Registration is required for a head count.

Subject: Trading Track hire


John,
 
We hired Scott Freeman in the last Trading Track interviews.  He is scheduled to start January 2, 2002 after he graduates from UT.  Should I have him arrive as planned next month or let him go?

"Enron Center South Technology Watch","Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

"Thursday PM Ernst update","All-

I went to see Richard this afternoon, and he's doing well.  They gave him
steroids last night, and within a few hours, much of the pain had subsided.
He hasn't needed morphine all day.

He is in good spirits, all things considered.  For example, I asked how he
was doing and he said ""Terrible!  All three of my fantasy football teams
lost, and I've got a tumor exploding in my head!""  He's being moved into
private room today, so personal visits, flowers, and phone calls will be
welcome.  The main number is 210-575-4040.  Just ask for Ernst.

As of today, the surgery is scheduled for Wednesday early afternoon.

Remember to say a prayer at noon tomorrow....that's UT (aka central) time,
for those of you who have moved away.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Guarded optimism about economic prospects helped rally stocks to new
highs for October, and the US Dollar re-asserted its strength during
a week that saw most Commodities lacking firm directions.  Lumber
was a rare exception, shooting higher on the basis of increased cash
market activity.  Wheat also ended with a solid advance tied to
exports.  Corn and Soybeans, however, continued to be pressured by
favorable weather conditions, while there was little movement in
Energies, although Natural Gas was firm.  Cotton slumped to 29-year
lows, Coffee looked uncertain, and Hogs lost ground.  Short-covering
on Friday ahead of the weekend produced nice bounces for Gold and
Copper.

I talked to Jason and had him get access to the analysis software. In the mean time, I am working with the weather group to get the temperature forecast for the rest of the winter. The weather group provide forecast only two weeks out and Jose is working on the rest of the winter forecast. If you want, I can bring you a copy of next two week's load forecast. Please let me know if you have any question.

Thanks

"All-Employee Meeting","The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed slightly lower on Friday due to light profit
taking ahead of the weekend. Nevertheless, this week's rally to new
highs for October keeps the fall rally intact and sets the stage for
a possible test of fib resistance crossing at 1857.56 later this
fall. The December S&P 500 index also closed slightly lower in quiet
trading on Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed.
Session highs fell just short of testing last week's high at 1114.50
before profit taking pressured the market into the close. If the
rally continues, the 50% retracement level of the May/September
decline crossing at 1137.45 is December's next upside target. 

The Dow closed higher on Friday thereby confirming yesterday's key
reversal up. Session highs fell short of testing broken fib support
crossing at 9636. The new high close for the month keeps this fall's
rebound alive while setting the stage for a possible test of this
summer's downtrend line, which crosses near 9905 later this fall. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December bonds posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday.
Early weakness led to a jab below broken resistance crossing at
107-11. However, a lack of follow-through selling failed to
materialize, which triggered a short covering rally into the close.
Friday's new contract high close sets the stage for additional gains
into early- November and a possible test of the October 1998 high,
which crosses at 111-21 later this year. This week's rally has turned
the daily ADX bullish. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed slightly higher on Friday due strength in gold,
fiber and some energy markets. The CRB is trying to carve out a
bottom just above the July 1999 low crossing at 182.67. Closes above
191.99 are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. The daily
ADX remains bearish but hints that this fall's decline may soon come
to an end.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed mixed on Friday in quiet trading. Recent
talk that OPEC will cut crude oil production by as much as 750,000
barrels on November 14th has put a floor under crude oil and the
products for the time being. 

December crude oil closed slightly higher on Friday as it posted an
inside week. Closes above 22.80 or below 21.41 are needed to clear up
near-term direction in the market. Daily momentum indicators are
bearish but becoming oversold while weekly indicators are bearish and
signal that new lows are still possible later this fall. 

December heating oil closed lower on Friday in lackluster trading as
it ended its fourth week of sideways trading. Closes above 68.60 or
below 61.40 are needed to confirm a breakout of this fall's trading
range and point the direction of the next trending move. Momentum
indicators are neutral to bullish hinting that sideways to higher
prices are possible into early-November.

December unleaded gas closed lower on Friday confirming Thursday's
downside reversal. Closes below 58.25 would set the stage for a
possible test of last week's low crossing at 56.80. However,
stochastics and RSI are bullish signaling that sideways to higher
prices are still possible.

December Henry Hub natural closed higher on Friday as it extends this
month's short covering rally and confirmed Wednesday's breakout above
the April/August downtrend line. Friday's high-range close leaves the
door open for additional strength on Monday as the seasonal trend
points to higher prices into mid-winter. Stochastics and RSI are
becoming overbought but signal that additional strength is still
possible.

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar posted an inside day with a slightly higher close
on Friday thereby leaving Thursday's key reversal down unconfirmed.
December is at a crossroads having spiked above September's high,
which coincides with the 50% retracement level of this summer's
decline at 116.65. Multiple closes above this resistance level are
needed to keep this fall's rally alive. Closes below October's
uptrend line and Thursday's low at 115.45 would all but confirm that
a short-term top has been posted. 

The December Swiss Franc posted an inside day with a slightly lower
close on Friday leaving yesterday's key reversal up unconfirmed.
December remains below broken trendline support crossing near .6082,
which leaves the door open for additional weakness this fall if
December can close below Tuesday's low at .5996. If the decline
resumes, the 50% retracement level crossing at .5944 is December's
next target. 

The December Canadian Dollar posted an inside day with a lower close
on Friday as it continues to consolidate above this week's low, which
appears to have also marked a double bottom with the late-September
low at .6315. Closes above .6367 would temper the near-term bearish
outlook in the market and could set the stage for a possible test of
October's high at .6422 later this fall. 

The December Japanese Yen posted an inside day with a higher close
due to light short covering on Friday. However, the rising ADX
signals that additional weakness into the end of October is still
possible. If the decline continues, the reaction low crossing at
.8090 is a potential target later this fall. 

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold closed higher on Friday as it extended its short
covering bounce off this week's low. Friday's close above the 62%
retracement level, which crosses at 278.10 has tempered the near-term
bearish outlook in the market while opening the door for additional
short covering into early- November. Stochastics and RSI are oversold
and turning neutral hinting that a low is in or very near. 

December silver closed slightly lower on Friday as it consolidates
above September's gap crossing at 4.20. If this support level gives
way, September's low at 4.175 is the next downside target. However,
momentum indicators are very oversold hinting that a short-term
bottom might be near. Closes above broken fib support crossing at
4.294 are needed before a bottom is confirmed. 

December copper closed sharply higher on Friday due to short covering
after failing to extend this week's decline below last Friday's low
at 62.25. Today's close at broken long- term support crossing at
63.50 hints that additional short covering is possible. However, it
will take closes above last week's high of 65.20 to signal that a
bottom is in place. Momentum indicators are oversold and turning
neutral to bullish hinting that additional short covering is possible
next week. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

December corn closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the weekend. Session highs tested the September/October downtrend
line crossing near 2.07 but was unable to overcome this resistance
level. Until this initial resistance level is broken, the door
remains open for a possible test of this summer's low crossing at
2.02 1/4 this fall. With the bulk of this year's corn harvest still
ahead of us along with the upcoming November supply/demand report,
upside potential near-term appears limited. 

December wheat closed above key resistance marked by August's high at
2.93 1/2 as it confirmed Thursday's key reversal up. This week's
strong export sales report along with mounting concerns over flooding
in Argentine wheat country continues to underpin this fall's rally.
Multiple closes above August's high would confirm today's breakout
thereby setting the stage for a test of the 50% retracement level of
the January/September decline crossing at 2.97 possibly on Monday.
Momentum indicators are bullish but becoming overbought while the
daily ADX (a trend-following indicator) has turned bullish signaling
that sideways to higher prices into early-November are possible. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

November soybeans posted an inside day on Friday due to light profit
taking ahead of the weekend as it consolidated some of this week's
gains. With soybean harvest rapidly coming to an end, downside risk
appears limited at this time. Thursday's breakout above October's
downtrend line signaled that a harvest low might be in place. Closes
above the August/September downtrend line crossing near 4.36 are
needed before this is confirmed. This week's downturn by the daily
ADX provides added confirmation that an important low was posted
earlier this week. 

December soybean meal closed higher on Friday due to light short
covering. Session highs fell short of filling this month's gap
crossing at 163.90 before a sell off ahead of the close tempered some
of today's losses. Friday's mid- range close leaves the door open for
a possible setback on Monday as December may try and consolidate some
of this week's gains. Longer-term, the door is open for a test of the
top of the gap crossing at 163.90 then October's high crossing at
167. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

December hogs closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead of
the weekend as the market consolidated some of this week's losses.
Additional pressure came from light position squaring ahead of this
afternoon's monthly USDA hogs and pigs report. This afternoon's snout
count showed the U.S. pig crop as of September was 8.56 million head,
slightly below the previous year's level. Sow farrowing during this
time frame totaled 964,000 head, 1% below last year. The average
litter size for September rose to 8.88 compared with 8.84 last year.
This afternoon's report had no surprises in it so traders will
continue to focus on demand versus supply for near-term direction.
Weekly momentum indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to
lower prices are likely into November. The daily ADX is also bearish
mode and rising, which signals that additional weakness is possible.

December cattle posted an inside day with a slightly lower close on
Friday leaving Thursday's key reversal up unconfirmed. Gains were
limited as cash bids continue to run at a discount to futures prices.
Closes above the September/October downtrend line crossing near 67.50
are needed to confirm that a bottom has been posted. Stochastics and
RSI are neutral to bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
are possible into early November.

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

December coffee posted a key reversal down on Friday due to producer
selling as harvest is beginning in southeast Mexico. Session highs
fell short of testing broken long-term support marked by the April
1975 low, which crosses at 45.25. Additional weakness on Monday is
needed to confirm today's bearish reversal pattern. Closes below
Monday's low would renew this year's decline while setting the stage
for a possible test of psychological support crossing at 40- cents
later this year.

December cocoa posted a key reversal up on Friday following a spike
below the 62% retracement level of the September/October rally, which
crosses at 979. Additional strength on Monday is needed to confirm
today's bullish reversal pattern. However, closes above Wednesday's
high at 1022 are needed to signal that a short-term bottom was posted
with today's low. Stochastics and RSI are bearish but oversold
hinting that a low is in or near. 

March sugar posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday hinting
that a short-term top might be in placed. A close below this week's
low crossing at 660 is needed before this can be confirmed.
Stochastics are bullish but becoming overbought warning traders to
use caution as a short-term top might be in or is near. If the rally
off this month's low continues this summer's downtrend line crossing
near 709 is March's next upside target. 

December cotton closed higher on Friday due to short covering as it
posted a key reversal up due to its extreme oversold condition.
However, December remains below broken long-term support crossing at
29.50 cents. With December cotton trading at new 29-year lows,
additional weakness is still possible. The daily ADX (a
trend-following indicator) is still in a bearish mode signaling that
additional weakness near-term is possible.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

Stock indexes closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the close. The NASDAQ posted another inside day with a slightly
lower close as it consolidates below minor resistance crossing at
1933.94. Weekly momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible during the last half of
November. If the aforementioned resistance level is cleared, the 25%
retracement level of the 2000/2001 decline crossing at 2071.93 is a
potential target later this year. The December S&P 500 index closed
lower on Friday but held above the 50% retracement level of the
May/September decline crossing at 1137.45. The door remains open for
a test of the reaction high crossing at 1163.90 later this month. 

The Dow closed slightly lower on Friday due to light profit taking
ahead of the weekend. Losses were limited following the release of
today?s economic reports and ideas that the conflict in Afghanistan
may come to an end by the end of the year. If this fall?s rebound
continues, the 62% retracement level of this year?s decline crossing
at 10094.10 is the Dow?s next target. 

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

December T-bonds extended this week?s sharp sell off on Friday and
tested the 75% retracement level of the Sept./Oct. rally crossing at
104-29. December bonds have decline over 5 points since Tuesday.
While momentum indicators are bearish signaling that additional
weakness is possible during the last half of November I would not be
surprised to see a modest short covering bounce early next week.
Longer-term the door is open for a possible test of September?s low
crossing at 102-17. 

The CRB INDEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

The CRB index closed higher on Friday due to a rebound in energies,
grains, fiber and foods. Session lows fell short of testing trendline
support drawn across this fall?s lows. Closes below this support
level crossing near 186 are needed to confirm that the shallow
rebound off October?s low has ended. At the same time closes above
this week?s high crossing at 190.46 are needed to renew this fall?s
rally. 

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

The energy markets closed higher on Friday due to short covering as
it consolidated some of this week?s sharp losses. However, upside
potential appears limited due to the possibility of a protracted
fight between Russia and OPEC that could last for some time. 

December crude oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher close
due to light short covering. However, December remains poised to test
of the 75% retracement level of the 1998/2000 rally crossing at 16.83
later this month. If this support level fails to halt this fall?s
decline the January 1999 reaction high crossing at 13.75 is a
possible target later this fall. Momentum indicators are bearish
signaling that additional weakness is possible during the last half
of November. 

December heating oil posted an inside day with a modestly higher
close on Thursday due to light short covering. However, a sell off
ahead of the close tempered some of today?s gains leaving the door
open for sideways trading on Monday. Session highs tested broken
support marked by the October 1999 low crossing at 53.40. If this
week?s decline continues, the 75% retracement level of the 1999/2000
rally crossing at 48.50 is December?s next likely target. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
likely into the last half of November. 

December unleaded gas ended higher on Friday due to light short
covering as it consolidated some of this week?s losses. However,
today?s short covering bounce fell short of testing broken support
crossing at 51.87. While another day or two of short covering is
possible, the door is open for additional weakness with the June 1999
low crossing at 47.00 being December?s next likely target. Momentum
indicators are bearish signaling that sideways to lower prices are
possible near-term. 

December Henry Hub natural posted an upside reversal on Friday after
spiked below October?s low crossing at 2.535. Additional strength on
Monday is needed to confirm today?s bullish reversal pattern thereby
increasing the odds that this week?s low marked a double bottom with
October?s low. If the decline off October?s high continues, weekly
fib support crossing at 2.402 is a potential target later this year.
Short-term momentum indicators are bearish but have entered their
respective oversold zones hinting that a double bottom might be
forming if October?s low can halt this month?s decline. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

The December Dollar posted another quiet inside day with a lower
close as it consolidates just below trading range resistance crossing
at 116.60. Closes above Wednesday?s high at 117.05 would confirm a
breakout above this falls trading range and could lead to a test of
August?s reaction high crossing at 117.49 later this month.
Stochastics remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices
are still possible. 

The December Swiss Franc closed higher on Friday as it extended its
short covering bounce off Wednesday?s low. Monday will be a key day
in near-term direction of the market. A higher opening followed by a
lower close on Monday would signal that this week?s short covering
bounce has likely come to an end. Closes below Wednesday?s low at
.5961 would renew December?s decline and set the stage for a likely
test of the 50% retracement level of the July/September rally
crossing at .5944. Momentum indicators are bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible during the later part of November. 

The December Canadian Dollar closed modestly lower on Friday, as is
consolidated above October?s broken downtrend line. Today?s mid-range
close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Monday. If
December extends this week?s short covering rally the 25% retracement
level of the July/November decline crossing at .6322 is December?s
next upside target. Momentum indicators are bullish signaling that
sideways to higher prices are possible near-term. 

The December Japanese Yen closed out the week on a low note on
Friday. However, session lows fell short of testing October?s low
crossing at .8132. If this support level is broken thereby renewing
December?s decline off September?s high this summer?s low crossing at
.8060 is a potential target later this year. Stochastics and the RSI
are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices are possible into the
last half of November. 

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

December gold posted a second consecutive close below October?s low
on Friday thereby opening the door for a possible test of August?s
reaction low crossing at 272.60 later this month. However, today?s
mid-range close leaves the door open for a possible short covering
bounce on Monday. Stochastics and the RSI are bearish signaling that
additional weakness is possible during the last half of November. 

December silver posted an inside day with a lower close on Friday as
it consolidates below broken support crossing at 4.15. Close below
last Friday?s low crossing at 4.055 cents would renew December?s
decline off September?s high and could lead to a possible test of
weekly support crossing at 3.90 later this month. 

December copper posted a key reversal up on Friday ending Thursday?s
correction. At the same time December will need to close above
Thursday?s high crossing at 69.60 to renew its rebound off last
week?s low. If the rally resumes, August?s high crossing at 70.60 is
December?s next target. Short-term momentum indicators are bullish
but becoming overbought hinting that a test of August?s high early
next week could trigger a round of profit taking. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

December corn closed higher on Friday due in large part to spillover
strength from soybeans and wheat. This morning?s export sales report
came in at 31.9 million bushels, which was near the upper end of
pre-report estimates but still below the pace needed to reach USDA
export projections. Today?s high-range close sets the stage for a
firmer opening on Monday but closes above initial gap resistance
crossing at 2.09 1/2 are needed to trigger new buying interest in the
market. Until then sideways trading will continue to dominate the
market near-term. 

December wheat closed sharply higher on Friday as short covering
gains were exaggerated as buy stops were hit above 2.86, which pushed
December above last week?s high of 2.88 1/2. While a setback is
possible on Monday due to ideas that today?s gains were overdone
today?s rally turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to
bullish signaling that the sell off from October?s high has come to
an end. Today?s rally found little support from this week?s export
sales report, which came in at 14 million bushels and well within
pre-report estimates. 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

January soybeans closed higher on Friday as bulls stepped up to the
plate and defended their positions following this week?s breakout
above initial gap resistance crossing at 4.44 1/. Today?s rally fell
just short of filling October?s gap crossing at 4.53 1/2, which
coincides with the 25% retracement level of the July/October decline
crossing at 4.54. Closes above these key resistance levels are needed
to open the door for a larger-degree post-harvest rebound that could
last into the end of the year. Today?s weekly export sales report
came in near the low end of pre-report estimates at 27.25 million
bushels. However, expectations for improving foreign and domestic
demand in the coming weeks along with a lack of sellers helps push
January to new highs for the week. 

December soybean meal closed steady on Friday after testing the upper
boundary of October?s trading range crossing at 167. A round of
profit taking ahead of the close erased early gains leaving the door
open for further consolidation on Monday. At the same time short-term
momentum indicators remain bullish signaling sideways to higher
prices are possible during the last half of November. Closes above
167 could lead to a test of September?s high crossing at 171 later
this month. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

December hogs closed sharply lower on Friday erasing the gains of the
past three trading sessions. Much of today?s pressure in the December
contract was due to bull spreaders dumping their positions ahead of
the weekend. With packers covered on their needed into next
Wednesday, weaker cash bids are expected to start the new week on
Monday. Momentum indicators remain bearish hinting that December
could renew its decline off last week?s high and possibly test
October?s low at 46.70 later next week before a bottom is in place. 

December cattle closed higher on Friday due to short covering ahead
of this afternoon?s cattle-on-feed report. Momentum indicators have
turned bullish signaling that Monday?s low likely marked an important
bottom. The late- week rebound has V-bottom written all over the
market. This afternoon?s cattle-on-feed report was termed bearish.
The big question is whether or not the decline ahead of the report
factored in all of today?s bearish news. I am looking for a setback
on Monday as the market absorbs today?s negative report. Here are the
highlights of today?s report. 

USDA estimate Ave. guess Range of guesses

On Feed as of Nov. 1 ----- 100% 99.2% 98.0- 100.00%

Placed in October -------- 97% 91.5% 87.0- 97.5%

Marketed in October ------ 99% 99.1% 97.0- 100.00%

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

December coffee posted an inside day with a higher close on Friday
and remains poised to extend its short covering rebound off October?s
low. Closes above Wednesday?s high at 50.00 cents would renew this
week?s rally setting the stage for a test of August?s gap crossing at
54.00 later this year. Momentum indicators are turning bullish
signaling that additional gains are possible near-term. 

December cocoa gapped up and closed sharply higher on Friday as it
cleared both last February?s high at 1237 and weekly fib resistance
crossing at 1261. This week?s breakout above February?s high has
opened the door for a possible test of the 62% retracement level of
the 1997/2000 decline crossing at 1349 later this year. At the same
time, if today?s gap is filled next week it would signal that a top
has likely been posted as today?s gap was an exhaustion gap.

March sugar closed lower on Friday due to light profit taking ahead
of the weekend. If the rally continues, the 50% retracement level of
the June/October decline crossing at 755 is March?s next target.
Closes below this fall?s uptrend line crossing near 691 would confirm
that a short-term top has been posted. Weekly momentum indicators
remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices are possible
into late-November.

December cotton closed higher on Friday supported by this week?s
stellar export sales report that came in at 455,200 bales, the
strongest of the marketing year. Nevertheless, December failed to
exceed this week?s high at 35.60 and closed mid-range on the day.
This leaves the door open for sideways trading on Monday. Closes
below Thursday?s low at 33.40 could trigger new selling, which could
end the late fall rally. If the rally resumes, fib resistance
crossing at 37.25 is December?s next target. Momentum indicators are
bullish but nearing their respective overbought zones warning traders
to use caution as a short-term top might be near.

Garcia, whose practice time was limited all week, played in Saturday's game. He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib.

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1265&>, WR TB - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson sat out the second half of Tampa Bay's 41-14 victory over the Minnesota Vikings because of a right knee bruise and will have an MRI test Monday. He was already playing with a sore right hip that limited him in practice last week. ""I will get an MRI in the morning and go from there,"" Johnson said. ""Right now, they are saying that it's just a bruise. But we'll know more tomorrow. I probably could not have played if they needed me to. I was in pretty bad pain."" 

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB! D! AL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith pronounced himself OK despite having his right knee wrapped after the Dallas Cowboys' 17-3 victory over Arizona on Sunday. ""It's throbbing a little bit right now, but I'll be all right,"" Smith said. ""I felt it. I knew what it was. I didn't know the degree the injury was. It worried me a bit."" But Smith was able to walk off the field without assistance. He said he expects to play next week at the New York Giants. Coach Dave Campo said Smith would be re-evaluated on Monday, but said he was encouraged that Smith was walking around. 

Daunte Culpepper <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133263&>, QB MIN - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
According to published reports, Culpepper suffered a broken nose in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. He is not expected to miss any game action.

Eddie Kennison <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1296&>, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Kennison rushed one time for 10 yards against New England, and did not catch a pass. The veteran wideout has reverted back to statistical silence after a brief period of productivity. 

Mike Anderson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187481&>, RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Anderson rushed for only 40 yards on 14 carries against the Patriots. He did score on an eight-yard r! un! , but the Broncos let Olandis Gary carry the ball 10 times for 37 yards also. Denver appears to have lost some confidence in Anderson this year.

David Patten <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1790&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Patten caught five passes for 62 yards and a TD at Denver. He should continue to be a scoring threat as long as he remains one of New England's top two receivers.

Troy Brown <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1253&>, WR NE - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Brown caught nine passes for 86 yards and a TD at Denver. He also carried the ball one time for 31 yards. Brown will always be a big-play threat against the weaker defensive teams on the Patriots' schedule.

Curtis Conway <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1204&>, WR SD - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Conway caught nine passes for 120 yards against Buffalo, In the past, Conway was a disappoitment, but now he is working well with Doug Flutie and staying healthy. Conway is finally performing up to expectations as a Fantasy wideout.

Freddie Jones <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
! Jo! nes overcame a sprained ankle to play against the Bills, and caught two passes for five yards. One of his catches was good for a one-yard TD, and Jones may now get much of his numbers on short TD catches. Doug Flutie seems to prefer his wideouts over the tight end when the Chargers are outside the red zone.

Larry Centers <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1072&>, RB BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Centers was limited to eight receiving yards on four catches by San Diego. The Bills ideally want to get the ball downfield to their wideouts and Jay Riemersma, so don't expect good numbers from Centers ecery week.

Peerless Price <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133393&> , WR BUF - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Price caught eight passes for 151 yards and a TD at San Diego. While Price is still inconsistent, he appears to have improved enough to start for Fantasy teams occasionally.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Hasselbeck had his best game as a pro, throwing for 230 yards, two TDs and no interceptions. But he continued to have some troubles completing key passes and getting the ball downfield on important downs.

Shaun Alexander <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187382&>, RB SEA - JWillie Updated 10/28/01
The Dolphins held Alexander to 87 yards on 23 carries. Considering the strength of the Miami defense, Alexander's final numbers looked respectable, but he also fumbled twice. The Seattle RB will continue to post good yardage numbers, but the league's better defenses might limit his overall output.

Oronde Gadsden <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Gadsden caught only one pass for 15 yards at Seattle. Miami's No. 1 wideout is not playing well enough to be anything more than a Fantasy backup.

James McKnight <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1288&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/28! /0! 1
McKnight caught eight passes for 94 yards and a TD at Seattle, but also lost a fumble. The Miami receiver continues to be erratic and occasionally productive.

Ron Dayne <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=187386&>, RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 10/28/01
Dayne was held to just 19 yards on eight carries by Washington. He is not putting up consistently good numbers, and should not start for most Fantasy teams right now.

Amani Toomer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/28/01
Toomer caught nine passes for 109 yards and a TD against Washington. He rem! ai! ns a must-start Fantasy player, no matter what the opposition is.

Stephen Davis <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1440&>, RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Davis rushed for 107 yards against the Giants, but was held out of the end zone again. He is still running for good yardage, but the Redskins continue to score via the pass when they are able to move the ball.

Tony Banks <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1062&>, QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Banks threw for 190 yards, two TDs and was not intercepted by the Giants. Right, now the erratic QB is playing well enough to be used as a Fantasy reserve.

Duce Staley <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1757&>, RB PHI - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Staley played Sunday against Oakland but was held to 19 yards and a touchdown on three carries, with two catches for 35 yards. He was going up against a tough Raiders' rush defense, and should post better stats in future weeks. However, it bears noting that Correll Buckhalter led the Eagles with seven carries, which suggests that neither back is the clear go-to guy right now. That makes both risky starts.

Charlie Garner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1149&>, RB OAK - Russell Updated 10/28/01
Garner rushed 21 times for 77 yards and a touchdown Su! nd! ay at Philadelphia. This outing could put him firmly in place as the Raiders' featured back while Tyrone Wheatley remains sidelined.

Rich Gannon <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1034&>, QB OAK - Martin Updated 10/28/01
Gannon passed for just 158 yards, no touchdowns and no interceptions in Sunday's game at Philadelphia. He was facing a tall challenge in the Eagles' secondary, and we expect he will rebound with better stats in future weeks.

Donovan McNabb <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=133361&>, QB PHI - Russell Updated 10/28/01
McNabb passed for just 133 yards and no touchdowns Sunday against Oakland, but he didn't get intercepted either. It was asking a lot for him to post great stats against the Raiders' defense, but this was still a disappointment. McNabb is in a bit of a slump right now, but he should break out of it and be a useful Fantasy quarterback over the second half of the season.

Michael Pittman <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Matty Updated 10/28/01
Pittman rushed 16 times for just 29 yards Sunday at Dallas. He hasn't been much better than Thomas Jones this season, and we don't think either player will be a reliable Fantasy option for the remainder of the year.

David Boston <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&ra! nd! om=3664&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Boston caught nine passes for 108 yards in Sunday's game at Dallas. While Jake Plummer has been an inconsistent quarterback from a Fantasy perspective, Boston has proven a worthy player because he gets most of the looks in the Arizona passing game. He's easily a solid No. 2 receiver on any team.

Jake Plummer <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1003&>, QB ARI - Frank Updated 10/28/01
Plummer passed for 233 yards, no touchdowns and two interceptions in Sunday's game at Dallas, further exhibiting how inconsistent he can be. Unless the matchup dictates otherwise, you shouldn't rely on him for useful stats on a weekly basis.

Cowboys <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=8&>, DT DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
The Cowboys held the Cardinals to three points Sunday, and recorded two sacks and two interceptions in the game. Dallas' defense has been somewhat decent from a Fantasy perspective based on the matchup, but don't let this performance fool you into believing that this unit will give you consistent stats week in and week out.

Clint Stoerner <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/28/01
Stoerner completed 9-of-18 passes for 93 yards, no touchdowns and an interception while rushing for seven times for 23 yards and a scor! e ! in Sunday's game against Arizona. These numbers aren't great for the Fantasy owner, and they came against a weak Cardinals' secondary. We don't recommend Stoerner for your team based on this outing.

Emmitt Smith <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1094&>, RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 10/28/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Arizona late in the fourth quarter with a right knee injury after accumulating 83 rushing yards on 21 carries. He will be evaluated shortly.

Rob Johnson <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3664&key=1033&>, QB BUF - Giggles Updated 10/28/01
Johnson left Sunday's game in the third quarter with an apparent knee injury. He was taken to the locker room for further examination and was briefly replaced by Alex Van Pelt before he returned.

"RE: Wood Report Oct. 01 thru Oct. 15","Mike,
I've been working on your variable rate sheet you sent the other day.  I'm working with the IT guys to get that made into a web page so that it can be put onto the plasma screens.  We discussed the pros and cons today of using EOL Listen as opposed to Reuters and it appears that EOL Listen is the best way to go because IT is trying to keep the plasma screens in the new building limited to just web material.  I'll be getting that out as quickly as the IT guys can get it done.  I just talked to Matt Smith and he is going to come by and explain in better detail the Keystone page.  I'll take a look at this sheet you sent me, I'll find a way to get it automated and keep you up to date.

Thank you,

Aaron

Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the att [Berutti, Aaron] ached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

Thanks,
Mike

Please add a physical and finacial index pricing sheet with the same format.  We may need to create a more elaborate fin index curve file to accomodate this file.

BCS bowls starting to fill up

  _____  

By Brad Edwards
Special to ESPN.com


Two spots are now taken.

Six spots remain.

But the two most enviable positions in the Bowl Championship Series are still up for grabs. The next couple of weekends (maybe three) will decide which teams play for the national title, although the list of potential competitors seems to be shrinking.

Stock up: Oklahoma
The Sooners are just two wins away from Pasadena, as are Nebraska and Miami. The difference, however, is that one of Oklahoma's remaining games is at home against a team with a 3-7 record (Oklahoma State). Rivalry games are often unpredictable, but the Cowboys don't have much of a chance in this one. Not this year. Not against this team.

That puts OU in the Big 12 title game against the winner of Nebraska-Colorado. It's a neutral-field game for a chance to defend their national title, and a team with a loss can't ask for much more than that.

Stock down: BYU
The Cougars keep winning, which of course, is the object of football. But a very weak schedule and some tiny victory margins aren't earning them any respect in the computers. And even though BYU is more interested in gaining admiration from Fiesta Bowl reps than from computer analysts, it won't do them any good unless they reach the top 12 of the final BCS Standings. 

If they do get that high in the rankings, is certainly an advantage to have a fan base within driving distance of Arizona at a time when many Americans are hesitant to fly. But the reality is that the Fiesta Bowl is being played in the traditional Rose Bowl time slot on New Year's Day and will likely have Pac-10 champion Oregon as one of its participants. With that much in place, the Big Ten champ becomes a very attractive opponent -- especially if that team is Michigan. It's too bad for BYU that the Wolverines dodged the upset bullet over the weekend.

Michigan is just one home victory away from being in the BCS pool, and it's very tough to imagine any bowl selecting the Cougars over the Wolverines, given a choice between the two. BYU has a good team, a good name and a loyal following of fans, but they can't match Michigan's drawing power. Unless the Fiesta Bowl believes it needs the Cougars to sell out the stadium, they probably won't be going to Tempe to ring in the New Year. BYU won its national title by beating Michigan in the 1984 Holiday Bowl, but this bowl battle is likely to be won be the Maize and Blue. 

Under the radar
The ACC (Maryland) and Pac-10 (Oregon) have both determined their BCS representative, and the Big East (Miami) is all but official. And one way or the other, the Big Ten champion will also be determined by this Saturday. So, even though the Big 12 and SEC teams won't be decided until December, it's time to start making some guesses about who will get the at-large bids. The reality is that there won't be many teams to choose from. If Tennessee had lost to Kentucky and Michigan had lost to Wisconsin on Saturday -- both of which almost happened -- that might have presented a scenario in which there were no eligible at-large teams from the ACC, Big East, Big Ten or SEC. And since the Big 12 can't get more than two teams into the BCS, and Oregon has already played both Stanford and Washington State, everything would have played perfectly into the hands of an undefeated BYU.

The order of choice by the BCS bowls is dependent upon which teams are playing for the national title, but if things play out according to form and a Big 12 team finishes at No. 1, the Fiesta will get the first pick. If they choose the Big Ten champion, the Sugar Bowl will likely take another Big 12 team with one at-large selection, and the other choice should be the Tennessee-Florida loser to the Orange Bowl. If the Fiesta does take BYU as an at-large pick, that second team from the Big 12 would go to either the Sugar or the Orange. 

Florida still needs two losses from the group of Nebraska, Miami and Oklahoma to have a good chance to reach the Rose Bowl, but they might have been in even bigger trouble if not for a narrow escape by Tennessee over the weekend. The Vols are the only team the Gators can still get bonus points for a win against, and those would have been all but gone if Tennessee had lost to Kentucky.

Oklahoma is certainly in good shape if they win out and all else goes according to form, but there is one ""what if?"" scenario to think about. If Texas loses at Texas A&M and Colorado beats Nebraska on Friday, would Oklahoma still finish higher than Florida if both teams win out? The Texas loss would cost the Sooners some bonus points, and the Nebraska loss would prevent them from having an opportunity to pick up more. It's too early to know the impact of that series of events, but it is something for OU fans to think about over Thanksgiving dinner.

Texas has been all but eliminated from the national title hunt after Oklahoma's win at Texas Tech. The only remaining hope for the Longhorns is an Oklahoma State upset of the Sooners in Norman. Good luck. If Colorado beats Nebraska this week and then Oklahoma the following week in the Big 12 Championship Game, that might leave Texas as the highest ranked team from the conference, but it would not be enough to get them into the BCS top two unless Florida or Miami also loses.

If the season ended today ...
The top three still look the same, and all those behind them are trying to keep hope alive.

BCS Game of the Week: Nebraska at Colorado
It's hard to believe a team could be 11-0 without winning any type of crown, but that's the reality the Cornhuskers carry into Boulder. The winner of this game gets the Big 12 North championship and a trip to Dallas for the conference title. A loss might instead send Nebraska to Dallas for the Cotton Bowl.

This game is not only to keep the Huskers' title hopes alive, but as referenced above, it could also have an effect on the BCS futures of Oklahoma, Texas and Florida, as well as Tennessee and Oregon. Throw in the fact that this game normally comes down to the wire, and you can sense the drama it might present all across the country.

      <p>Dear Mike,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Mike Grigsby"" <Mike.Grigsby@enron.com>, who belongs to
list enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>The <b>Department of Energy</b> is hosting a <b>conference on Clean
Coal Technology</b> on Monday in Washington.  The conference will take a
look at where <b>coal-fired generation could be headed in the
future</b>.  <b>U.S. Energy Association Chairman John Derrick</b>, the
Chairman and CEO of <b>Pepco</b>, is among those scheduled to speak.
<p>Look for <b>energy legislation to move to the forefront when
lawmakers return from Thanksgiving break</b>.  Republicans in the Senate
say they want to take action on energy legislation in December, while
Democrats aren't as sure of the time frame. Next week, the Washington
bureau will bring us an <b>update on where legislation</b> stands and
what the chances are that we'll see a <b>comprehensive energy bill</b>
before the end of the year.
<p>The <b>North American Electric Reliability Council</b> will release
its <b>2001/2002 Winter Assessment</b> on Tuesday; our Washington bureau
will bring us coverage.
<p>If <b>MTBE</b> is banned, the <b>gasoline industry</b> will have to
drastically <b>increase production of ethanol</b>.  On Monday, the
Houston bureau's <br>Gale Smith will have a report on some companies
looking at <b>alternative ways of making ethanol</b>.  We'll find out
which products have a chance at becoming a substitute for MTBE.
<p>A recent poll taken by <b>Deloitte & Touche</b> says <b>power
deregulation in Texas won't mean an immediate rate reduction for
consumers</b>.  The Houston bureau will have more from Deloitte &
Touche's <b>Branko Terzic</b> on Monday.
<p>ENL's Kym McNicholas reports the <b>California Power Authority is
meeting</b> over the weekend to discuss the scope and direction of its
<b>Energy Resource Investment Plan</b>.  The plan is due to the
legislature and to the governor by February 15, 2002.  Kym will bring us
the latest on Monday from the weekend meeting.
<p>Also on Monday, the <b>California Energy Commission</b> will hear a
<b>petition</b> for reconsideration of its decision on <b>Calpine's

Is this report ready to be published daily?  I would update the storage info at the bottom.  Use the current storage balance for each facility, include a column showing daily activity, and show the maximum capacity and daily inj/wd capacity.  Keith will help you with this data.
 
Thanks,

Keith, 

I changed the report information as you requested. 
Please let me know if there are additional changes 
you need. On some of the storage points 
the current balance information is not available. 
I will work towards getting these, in the meantime 
let me know what else would be needed.

 	  	 Dear Mike,

I'm Washington Bureau Chief Peter Cook filling in for Jay Rickerts. 

On Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Washington on the final day of the FERC's weeklong workshop on Regional Transmission Organizations. Participants have told our bureau the workshop has been productive and tomorrow we'll find out how the meetings might impact FERC's implementation of RTOs. Former FERC Commissioner Don Santa will give us his thoughts during the 2:00 p.m. ET newscast on where RTOs stand now. 

We'll also get more reaction to the nomination of Joe Kelliher to fill the open seat at the FERC. Gay Friedmann of the INGAA will give us her thoughts on Kelliher's nomination during the 9:00 a.m. ET newscast. 

Finally from Washington on Friday, we'll bring you the latest from Congress on energy legislation. The anthrax scare has impacted an already crowded Congressional calendar and there's mixed opinion in the Senate on whether lawmakers there will vote on a comprehensive energy bill this year. 

ENL's Gale Smith reports, a major energy company is launching a 
one-of-a-kind Web site to buy fuel. The unique idea behind this is that customers helped develop the site. Motiva Vice President of Commercial Marketing and Distribution Ralph Grimmer talks about the site from the Houston bureau on Friday. 

The Houston bureau will also bring us a report on Sakonnet Technology on Friday. Sakonnet was started by a handful of former employees from JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch and has found success by being able to offer the same level of support as more established investment banks - for less money. Join us tomorrow from the Houston bureau for all the details on Sakonnet. 

From the West Coast bureau, ENL's Kym McNicholas says we'll have word on Friday from Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's press conference and remarks from his keynote address at Hoover Institution's Conference on California's electricity crisis. 

California Governor Gray Davis is expected to announce his administration's strategy to attempt renegotiation of the long-term power contracts the state signed between January and September of this year with electricity providers. Log on for these stories and more from the West Coast bureau. 

Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice. Occasionally guests cancel or change time slots. We'll continue to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events. 

Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.

Dear Trader:

Introducing - THE SCIENCE OF AUTOMATIC OPTION PROFITS

This shocking book reveals the most accurate and profitable 
trading strategies I have ever seen - anywhere. With 491 
wins out of 494 trades since May 1995, this is a virtual 
sure-thing-profit secret! 

In fact, in over 26 years in futures and options, I have 
never seen a trading system that came so close to virtually 
guaranteeing profits, trade - after - trade.

Win on at least 9 out of every 10 Trades 
- Absolutely Guaranteed!

Now I've seen hundreds of trading systems claiming huge 
profits - and most just self-destruct when put to the test.  
That's why I immediately began following this 
strategy...way back when I first learned of it.  

The results blew me away! Every trade - every last one - 
has been profitable since. Take a look for yourself. 

The phenomenal record was no pipe dream. Trade after trade, 
it has proven to be the trading system of a lifetime.

The STOCK INDEXES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=indexes

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--A reported jump in housing starts data Tuesday
set the tone for gains in stock index futures for most of the
session. U.S. housing starts rose 8.2% for November to a
seasonally-adjusted 1.645 million annual rate. This followed a
revised 4.0% fall in October to a 1.521 million annual rate. October
starts were previously reported as sliding 1.3% to a 1.552 million
annual rate. The readings were much stronger than economists'
expectations.

That data added to an already positive tone present in equity Markets
overnight thanks to encouraging news out of Circuit City and Best
Buy. Circuit City reported third-quarter earnings at 10 cents a
share. That was 3 cents better than analysts had been expecting.
Circuit City stock jumped over a full point on that news before
pulling back later in the session. Best Buy posted 37 cent third
quarter earnings, beating analysts' expectations by one cent. 

Chicago Mercantile Exchange stock index futures traders attributed a
late morning dip in prices to some independent traders losing
confidence that institutional players - such as Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs - which had been on the buy side early in the session,
would continue to support the market with their orders. The downtick
was further fueled when light sell stops were triggered under 1654.00
in the March Nasdaq futures contract. However, the contracts ended
just about at the top of their day ranges Tuesday. Analysts said
continued thin trade in equity futures contracts likely magnified
movement. Resistance for the March S&P futures contract is now seen
at the psychological resistance level of 1150.00. Support is seen at
Friday's low of 1115.80. Resistance for March Nasdaq is seen at
1674.00, the 50% retracement level from Dec. 6. Support is seen at
1596.00, Friday's low.

INTEREST RATES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=interest

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Treasury market squirreled away Modest
Gains Tuesday, in a quiet session that stood in stark contrast with
Monday's fireworks. At 3:45 p.m EST, the 10-year Treasury note stood
at 99 1/32, up 13/32 to yield 5.13%. The 30-year Treasury gained
14/32 to 97 28/32, yielding 5.52%. The five-year price gained 7/32 to
a 4.42% yield, while the two-year price was up 2/32 at a yield of
3.09%.

As it was on Monday, the market was all about light flows and a lack
of participation ahead of the Christmas holiday and year-end, a
condition that traditionally befalls the market this time of year. ""I
think the only thing in common"" between the two trading sessions ""is
light flows,"" said Michael Cloherty, market strategist with Credit
Suisse First Boston in New York. ""That's one of the things that
pushed the market so far yesterday - liquidity is pretty poor.""

In battening down the hatches, many dealers and investors are seeking
to protect profits ahead of the year-end. But there's also a
sentiment that news on the economy is mixed right now, and that
that's limiting the participation of some, market participants said.

ENERGY MARKETS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=energy

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Crude oil futures ended steady and most
gasoline futures contracts rose modestly Tuesday, while heating oil
futures posted moderate gains at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Heating oil futures briefly surged nearly 2 cents amid strength in
the US East and Gulf Coast cash markets as refinery selling waned.
Upcoming colder weather in the Northeast, the largest heating oil
market in the country, may have provided another boost. ""We can only
guess that it is some reaction to Monday afternoon's National Weather
Service short-term outlooks showing below-normal temperatures for the
Northeast in both the 6-10 and 8-14 day editions,"" said Tim Evans,
analyst at IFR Pegasus. Gasoline futures traded on middle ground as
refiners are seen curbing gasoline production but demand is seen
lackluster. 

HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--The natural gas futures contract eased into the
mid-$2.60s a million British thermal units Tuesday, as another day of
anticipated winter cold fell off the calendar. ""You don't need just
cold weather, you need an Ice Age,"" said Ed Kennedy of Pioneer
Futures Inc. in Miami. January settled at $2.657/MMBtu, down 2.9
cents, trading in a 12-cent range from $2.63-$2.75/MMBtu. February
fell 4.9 cents to $2.712/MMBtu. Looking ahead, expect that slow,
sinking feeling to continue well into January's expiration, traders
said. 

CURRENCIES http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=currencies

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The dollar tread water against the euro and
edged only slightly higher against the yen Tuesday, after some
traders questioned whether the rally in the dollar/yen and euro/yen
pairs over recent sessions may have been too much, too soon. Having
jumped to a fresh three-year high of Y128.43 during Asian trading,
the dollar slipped back as some market participants began to factor
in the likelihood that the Bank of Japan won't implement any major
new monetary initiatives at its two-day policy meeting, that
concludes Wednesday. 

The euro slid as low as Y114.91 at one point, well off its intraday
high of Y115.95. Even so, some analysts do expect some sort of policy
change from the BOJ and many market watchers think the dollar is
still set to move higher against the yen. 

PRECIOUS METALS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=metals

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Precious metals settled mixed Tuesday, with
gold futures rallying on fund buying and gathering enough momentum to
penetrate the key resistance area around $280 an ounce and silver
also flexed its technical muscle. Lack of sellers into the gains
helped the yellow metal accelerate upward, breaking through $280 and
tripping buy-stops above there, according to Refco Inc. analyst Jim
Steel. 

The March silver contract on Comex also mustered the strength to
break above resistance Tuesday, finishing 5.5 cents higher at $4.42
an ounce. No one still has any idea what's driving the rise in silver
lease rates, but Steel said he doubted people were borrowing just to
sell into the recent strength, as he hadn't seen evidence of selling
on the longer end of the curve. 

GRAINS http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Chicago Board of Trade corn and wheat futures
settled lower Tuesday mostly on spillover pressure by the soybean
market and on a late sell-off by locals and speculators. After a
lackluster, dull session corn and wheat futures sank to new session
lows about 15 minutes before the closing bell. ""It was very slow in
here until the last 15-20 minutes,"" said Victor Lespinasse, a grain
trader with A.G. Edwards in Chicago. ""Corn and wheat came down in
sympathy with beans."" 

SOYBEAN COMPLEX http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=grains

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--After a two-sided, dull session Chicago Board of
Trade soybean futures closed lower Tuesday on a late technical
sell-off. January soybean futures tumbled within 3.50 cents of the
contract low. ""It was a technical break,"" said one floor trader.

Soybeans garnered some strength earlier from large commercial buying
and ideas hot/dry weather in Argentina could hurt the quality of the
crop there. Floor brokers said ADM bought between 700-900 contracts
of January soybeans and Cargill bought 500 contracts. Market watchers
said commercials were the best scale down buyers in soybeans and oil.

Soy meal futures collapsed late in the session to post solid losses
in sympathy with the weak soybean market and on widespread selling by
the speculators. Soy oil was the leader to the downside earlier in
the session, according to floor brokers. ""The sell-off started in the
soy products, which led to a general sell-off,"" said Victor
Lespinasse, a grain trader with A.G. Edwards. 

LIVESTOCK http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=livestock

CHICAGO (Dow Jones)--Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures
ended at or near limit-up levels Tuesday, as talk spread in the
trading pit that Mother Nature's winter wrath would soon be felt in
some of the nation's major cattle feeding areas. The soon-to-expire
December contract ended up the $1.50 per/hundredweight limit, hitting
a nearly one-week high. The most-actively traded February contract
surged to a two-week peak, while April climbed to a three-week high.
Each contract finished 2.5 cents below the limit price. The bullish
sentiment spilled over to feeder cattle futures, which ended limit-up
in almost every contract. 

Lean hog and pork belly futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
ended mostly lower Tuesday in a light-volume day as the market faced
uncertainties over cash hog values for the remainder of the week. The
market had a relatively bearish tone at the open when the market
failed Monday to move above a key resistance level of $53.70. Sell
stops were tripped in February below $52.90 - around Monday's low.
Another damping effect was Monday's low cattle kills of only 103,000
head versus 125,00 a week earlier. Tuesday's kill was 124,000. 

FOOD & FIBER http://quotes.ino.com/exchanges/?c=food

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Arabica coffee futures on the Coffee, Sugar &
Cocoa Exchange settled lower Tuesday in an extension of the selling
wave that started on Monday, traders said. The bearish tone of the
market was set from the opening bell, with prices leaning to the
downside on perceptions that the reported drawdown on Green Coffee
Association's stocks was too low.

Cocoa futures settled lower Tuesday after a late bout of hedge
selling kept the market near the session's low. The move was called a
""corrective"" pullback by some participants, but it wasn't expected to
alter the market's long-term bullish outlook. Cocoa prices whipsawed
for the first half of the session in very thin volume, with early
long liquidation weighing on prices. Once that quieted down, some
short covering by locals briefly pushed the most-active March
contract into positive terrain until renewed light selling emerged. 

World March raw sugar futures closed at a six-week low Tuesday after
a dramatic trading session, which featured a massive amount of
technical selling by funds. The market began weaker off the back of
heavy selling in the Liffe market. Locals and small speculators sold
the market down to 7.15 cents, which is where funds sell-stops
kicked-in, and then a downward spiral ensued. After the market hit a
low of 7.02 cents a pound, locals and speculators started short
covering, but the rally was short lived and selling once agaiin took
charge of the market. Final volume was estimated at a hefty 33,000
lots. 

After a listless session, cotton futures on the New York Cotton
Exchange settled lower Tuesday in what some participants described as
a consolidation move. The market opened modestly lower in light trade
selling, and the most active March contract floated within a
relatively tight trading range for most of the session. ""There is
really nothing going on - it's a bit choppy but there's not much
activity down here,"" said one floor broker.

<1> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Traders needed to be nimble and quick this week to take
advantage of sudden, sharp moves in the commodity markets
highlighted by gains in Cattle, Cocoa, Coffee and Wheat and
declines in Crude Oil, Gold and Hogs.  Meanwhile, the Dollar
stood strong and Stocks put in another solid performance
helped by progress in the U.S.-led campaign in Afghanistan,
although another sharp drop in U.S. industrial production
tempered enthusiasm.  Export rumors fired up Wheat as well
as Soybeans which racked up five-week highs.  While
confusion over OPEC's output intentions dominated the
headlines, the soft global economy was the underlying factor
weighing on Crude, while Natural Gas came under pressure
from unusually warm weather conditions.  Copper was firm,
but tentative, Gold was weak, and a rally in Orange Juice
fizzled out.

"RE: Griffith Sales","Sean,

I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is ""assuring me"" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Mike,
Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

Aaron

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Ricky Watters <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1151&>, RB SEA - McKay Updated 10/23/01
According to the Tacoma News Tribune, Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch.

Trent Dilfer <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point.

Matt Hasselbeck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantas! y ! perspective, so don't use him this week.

Wayne Chrebet <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Dedric Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season.

Lamar Smith <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&! ra! ndom=73&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week.

Marvin Minnis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week.

Jerome Pathon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12612&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week.

Terrence Wilkins <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week.

Terrell Davis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He wi! ll! work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Petersburg Times, Dunn doesn't have a hamstring strain, as was originally reported. Dunn won't practice until late in the week, however, but he is expected to play on Sunday against Minnesota. 

Duce Staley <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1757&>, RB PHI - TayDang Updated 10/23/01
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the ga! me! . At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Joe Nedney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1389&>, K TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Nedney suffered a neck injury in Sunday's game but is expected to play this week. 

Erron Kinney <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187582&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Kinney will be listed on the injury report because of a calf injury. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Kevin Dyson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12342&>, WR TEN - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Dyson is recovering from a thumb injury but is expected to play in Monday's game against the Steelers. He is expected to participate in practice.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear Updated 10/23/01
George suffered a thumb injury in Sunday's game. He is expected to play in this week's game. 

Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/23/01
McNair is suffering from a sore ankle as a result of a play in Sunday's game. However, he is expected to play in this week's game. 

Chris Sanders <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=pl! ay! ers&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
The Tennessean reports that Sanders has a disc problem in his back. The reserve receiver is expected to see a specialist this week. Treatment options consist of rest, an injection, or surgery. Don't expect Sanders to play anytime soon. Rookie Drew Bennett will play in his absence. 

Damon Jones <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1736&>, TE JAC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Jones is expected to resume practicing on Wednesday. An MRI on his shoulder showed that his injury would not require surgery. 

Fred Taylor <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12753&>, RB JAC - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Taylor has been ruled out of Sunday's game against Baltimore and his status for next week's game remains uncertain. ""All I know is that, from week to week, they increase his exercises and change of direction,"" head coach Tom Coughlin told The Florida Times-Union. ""It remains to be seen when Fred will be able to play. Progress is slow. I'm hoping he responds well this week, then we can make some kind of legitimate guess [about a return date] next week."" Taylor has been inactive since severely injuring his groin on Sept 23. 

Dennis Northcutt <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187617&>, WR CLE - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Northcutt left Sunday's game because of a concussion. He is expected to play when the Browns return to action next week. 

Todd Heap <http://football210.fanta! sy! .sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=235215&> , TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Heap did not play Sunday but head coach Brian Billick told The Baltimore Sun he is optimistic that the rookie will play in this week's game. Heap has been inactive for the last four games because of a sprained ankle. 

Terry Allen <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/23/01
Allen, who left after the fifth play of Sunday's game with a sprained ankle, is questionable for this week's game. Jason Brookins will start at running back if Allen is inactive. 

Elvis Grbac <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1035&>, QB BAL - TexOK Updated 10/23! /0! 1
Coach Brian Billick expects Grbac to be ready for Sunday's game against Jacksonville, but the quarterback wasn't so sure. ""I'm day-to-day. I'm feeling pretty sore in the chest area,"" Grbac said Monday. ""There could be something going on with the cartilage. I haven't picked up a ball or thrown a ball, so we'll just have to wait and see."" Randall Cunningham will replace Grbac if he is unable to play. 

Az-Zahir Hakim <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=12411&>, WR STL - Metz Updated 10/23/01
Hakim suffered a calf injury during Sunday's blowout win over the New York Jets. However, he is expected to be available for this weekend's game against New Orleans. 

Trung! C! anidate <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187503&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

J.J. Stokes <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1292&>, WR SF - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Stokes spent much of the bye week tending to his injured legs, and is close to being completely healthy. ""Thankfully the bye week came so early. It was a blessing for me because I was able to get treatment every day,""! S! tokes told the Contra Costa Times . ""I practiced today good. I wouldn't say I'm 100 percent but I'm darn close."" Stokes has been less than mediocre, however, so don't use him as a regular starter unless he proves himself to be more reliable. 

Ike Hilliard <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1785&>, WR NYG - Pink Panthers Updated 10/23/01
Hilliard continues to improve each week, and is now back in the Giants' starting lineup. Hilliard led the G-Men with six catches for 80 yards on Monday night against Philadelphia, and looked as though his surgically-repaired foot is almost completely healed. 

Ron Dixon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01
Dixon missed Monday night's 10-9 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles due to a sprained ankle. The reserve wideout is day-to-day. 

Marshall Faulk <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=73&key=1109&>, RB STL - Grigsby Updated 10/23/01
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go.

Please define close?  Also, what is the outstanding issue with Redwood?  Please set up another meeting with a copy of the actual flows to Palo, sales prices, third party deals and an example of an invoice.  I would like to walk through the deal.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks
 
Anne

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

_____________________________________________________________________

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed down $0.20 at $66.95

today. Prices closed near the session low on reported commercial
selling, after briefly probing above $68.00 early in the session.
Poor boxed beef movement today offset ideas that cash cattle prices
might trade steady to firmer this week. There were early reports from
Nebraska that quoted dressed beef prices 50 cents higher than last
week. 

December lean hogs closed up $0.10 today at $50.47. A firmer cash hog
market today limited selling interest, as did lighter hog marketings
the past couple days. Still, the bulls are on the ropes in this
market. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 2 3/4 cents lower at $2.05
today. Prices closed at the session low. Weekly export sales came in
about as expected and the market continues to feel pressure from
harvest and uninspired demand. There was no follow-through buying
interest today, so a bullish key reversal was not confirmed. 

November soybeans closed 3 1/4 cents lower at $4.30 3/4 today.
Despite very solid weekly export sales figures for soybeans, meal and
oil, reported early this morning, the markets could not rally on that
news. This is an ominous sign for the bulls for at least the near
term. There was no follow-through buying today, so a bullish key
reversal up was not confirmed. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed off 1 3/4 cents at $2.83 today.
Prices pushed to a fresh seven-week high today, but could not hold
gains and closed near the session low. Still, bulls should not be too
displeased by today's price action. The recent rally in Dec. wheat
raises the possibility of a double-bottom reversal pattern developing
on the daily bar chart. This morning's weekly export sales figures
came in about as expected and were not market-moving. First
resistance is now seen at $2.88. First support lies at the $2.80
area.

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 7 points lower at 6.56 cents today.
Prices took a ""rest day"" today after pushing to a fresh two-week high
Wednesday. The bulls have seen a nice mini run since the lows scored
a little over a week ago. But overall, bears still have a technical
edge. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 85 points higher at 45.60 cents today.
Prices pushed to a high of 47.50 before backing off and closing near
the session low. This week's activity in coffee is a bit encouraging
to the bulls. However, it's too early to make anything significant
out of it. Any increase in volatility at these low price levels will
favor the bullish camp. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $8 lower today, at $1,058. Prices took a
""rest day"" today after scoring a bullish key reversal up this week.
Bulls are gaining momentum. If they can push prices back above the
$1,086 level and fill the downside gap created on the daily bar chart
a couple weeks ago, then bulls will be right back in the ball game. 

December cotton closed 35 points lower at 31.18 cents in quiet
trading again today. Solid USDA weekly export sales for cotton failed
to lift the market. But I do look for some more short covering in the
coming sessions, but make no mistake: bears are in command. 

November orange juice on Wednesday afternoon closed at 85.85. That's
off 25 points from the Tuesday evening close. Prices are due for some
corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. Bulls have the
edge. Last week's USDA Florida orange figure was termed bullish. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed off $4.20 today at $279.80
an ounce. More technical damage was done today as prices fell below
the $280 level. Bears are poised to push prices on down to the $275
area in the near term.

December silver futures closed $0.107 lower at $4.263 an ounce today.
Prices hit a fresh five-week low today as prices fell down into the
upside gap area on the daily bar chart that was created in early
September. 

December N.Y. copper closed 70 points lower at 63.20 cents. Prices
today dropped to a fresh contract low of 63.00 cents. Bulls' hopes of
some ""basing"" activity the past couple weeks have been dashed. Prices
need to push above 66 cents and see a couple closes above that level
before the bulls get much confidence. Next support is seen at 63.00
cents--the contract low. 

ENERGIES: December crude closed off $0.50 at $21.60 today. Prices
dropped to another fresh four-week low today. A big bear flag
continues to form on the daily chart. If there is a downside breakout
from this big bear flag, which may be occurring right now, the
measuring implications point to possible losses to well below $20.00
per barrel. 

December heating oil closed off 128 points, at .6162 today. Prices
today matched the September low and are poised for more losses. It
looks like a big bear flag is forming on the daily bar chart, and
this week may have been the downside breakout from that pattern. 

December unleaded gasoline closed 126 points lower at .5737 today.
Prices scored another fresh yearly low today. It looks like prices
have broken out on the downside of a bearish pennant pattern on the
daily bar chart this week. 

December natural gas closed $0.117 higher at $2.82 today. The nat gas
market is acting well, given the liquid energies continue to
deteriorate. Prices pushed to a fresh five-week high Wednesday. Bulls
have gained a bit of momentum, but bears have the overall advantage. 

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 13
points higher today at .9023. Bears have gained confidence recently.
Prices are presently trading below a

five-week-old downtrend line drawn off the September and October
highs. 

The December Japanese yen closed up 7points at .8285 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of
the yen. A steep four- week-old downtrend line is in place on the
daily bar chart. Next support is seen at 8236 level and then the
.8200 level. First resistance is seen at the .8350 area. 

The December Swiss franc closed 17 points higher at .6118 today.
While a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily
bar chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar
chart remains intact. The stage is set for bulls and bears to do
battle this week. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 35 points lower at .6328 today.
Significant technical damage occurred in this currency today, as
prices dropped sharply and are right back down close to the April and
September lows. 

The December British pound closed 14 points lower at 1.4410. It was
another quiet day today. The recent collapse in volatility makes me
suspect a bigger price move is on the horizon. Bears have the slight
edge. Technical damage has been inflicted recently. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 4 points lower at 114.74
today. Bulls have made progress recently, but need to keep the
pressure on the bears. It appears a head-and- shoulders bottom
reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 3/32 higher at 106 26/32. Bulls are
having a very good week, so far, and they needed it. Bulls can
correctly argue this market was due for some corrective
consolidation. The charts are still favoring the bulls. However, very
strong resistance located just above the 107 even area stopped
another bull run in bonds recently. 

December S&P 500 futures closed slightly lower today. Today there was
follow-through selling and a bearish key reversal down was confirmed
on the daily bar chart. Friday's price action, heading into the
weekend, will be extra important for the index. The growing anthrax
scare has spooked traders this week.

_____________________________________________________________________

LIVESTOCK: December live cattle closed up $0.28 at $67.25 today.
Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" on the daily bar

chart today, as traders squared positions ahead of this afternoon's
USDA monthly cattle-on-feed report. That report, released after the
close, showed placements at 79% in September, and that's a bullish
figure. 

December lean hogs closed off $0.42 today at $50.05. A weaker cash
hog market today and talk of weaker cash prices early next week
pressured the futures today. The late-week ""pause"" could be setting
up the next leg down in the market. 

GRAINS: December corn futures closed 1/4 cent higher at $2.05 1/2
today. Prices dropped to a fresh 3.5-month low today as the market
continues to feel pressure from harvest and uninspired demand. My
bias is that the door is still opened to a decline to the June low of
around $2.03, or below. 

November soybeans closed 6 1/4 cents lower at $4.24 3/4 today. Prices
closed at the weekly low close today after very solid weekly export
sales figures for soybeans, meal and oil could not rally the market
Thursday. That was an ominous sign for the bulls for at least the
near term. 

December Chicago SRW wheat closed up 4 cents at $2.87 today. Bulls
had an excellent week. Prices pushed to another fresh seven-week high
today. The recent rally in Dec. wheat confirms a double-bottom
reversal pattern on the daily bar chart. 

SOFTS: March N.Y. sugar closed 17 points higher at 6.73 cents today.
Prices closed near the session high and at the weekly high close
today--and hit a fresh three-week high today. That's positive for
bulls heading into next week. 

December N.Y. coffee closed 175 points lower at 43.85 cents today.
The bears set a trap for the premature bulls this week, as prices
sold right back off after the pop north on Thursday. Still, this
week's activity in coffee is a bit encouraging to the bulls, as the
increase in volatility at these low price levels favors the bullish
camp. 

December N.Y. cocoa closed $32 lower today, at $1,026. Prices gapped
lower today and closed near the session low.

It was a volatile week this week, and bears won the battle--even
though prices scored a bullish key reversal up this week. 

December cotton closed 63 points lower at 30.55 cents today. Prices
fell to a fresh contract low of 30.51 cents

today. For a longer-term perspective, nearby New York cotton futures
sunk to a low of 29.50 cents in 1986. 

November orange juice on Thursday afternoon closed at 86.95. That's
up 110 points from the Wednesday evening close. Prices this week saw
some corrective consolidation after the recent big gains. This
""pause"" is not at all bearish and bulls have the edge. 

METALS: December COMEX gold futures closed up $0.90 today at $280.70
an ounce. Significant technical damage was done this week in gold.
The daily chart favors the bears heading into next week. 

December silver futures closed $0.01 higher at $4.273 an ounce today.
Prices hit a fresh five-week low Thursday. Bears have the big edge.
Silver has suffered technical damage recently. 

December N.Y. copper closed 85 points lower at 62.35 cents. Prices
today dropped to another fresh contract low of 62.25 cents. Next
support is seen at 62.00 cents.

Next resistance is seen at 64 cents. Worries about demand in the face
of the potential for consumer ""retrenchment"" have pressured the
market. 

ENERGIES: December crude closed up $0.71 at $22.66 today. Prices
showed a corrective bounce in a bear market today.

Prices dropped to a four-week low just Thursday. A big bear flag
still may be forming on the daily chart, but if there is more upside
action next week, that flag will not play out and will be negated. 

December heating oil closed up 178 points, at .6339 today. Prices
scored a corrective bounce in a bear market today. Prices Thursday
matched the September low. A big bear flag may still be forming on
the daily bar chart, but more upside action next week will negate
that formation. 

December unleaded gasoline closed 248 points higher at .5985 today.
Prices scored a corrective bounce in a bear market today. Prices
scored a fresh yearly low just Thursday. A bearish pennant pattern on
the daily bar chart still could be forming, but would be negated next
week if there's more upside price action. 

December natural gas closed $0.19 higher at $2.99 today. Prices today
pushed to a six-week high and closed at the weekly high close. This
bodes well for price action heading into next week. The nat gas
market had been acting well, given the recent downturn in liquid
energies. 

STOCKS, FINANCIALS, CURRENCIES: The December Euro currency closed 48
points lower today at .8975. Prices scored a fresh six-week low today
and closed at the weekly low close. That's bearish heading into
trading early next week. 

The December Japanese yen closed off 5 points at .8280 today. Prices
pushed to a fresh two-month low just Tuesday. Bears have control of
the yen. A steep four-week- old downtrend line is in place on the
daily bar chart. 

The December Swiss franc closed 27 points lower at .6091 today. Bears
won the battle this week as prices closed at the weekly low close.
While a steep four-week-old downtrend line is in place on the daily
bar chart, a longer-term 3.5-month-old uptrend line on the daily bar
chart remains intact--but just barely. 

The December Canadian dollar closed 10 points higher at .6338 today.
Prices scored a quiet ""inside day"" today, but significant technical
damage occurred in this currency this week, as prices dropped sharply
and are now back down close to the April and September lows. 

The December British pound closed 120 points lower at 1.4304. Prices
fell sharply today and closed at the weekly low close, as well as set
a fresh five-week low. This is bearish heading into trading Monday. 

The September U.S. dollar index closed 44 points higher at

115.18 today. Prices pushed to a fresh five-week high today and the
bulls won the battle this week. It appears a head-and-shoulders
bottom reversal pattern has formed on the daily bar chart. 

December U.S. T-bonds closed 16/32 lower at 106 10/32. Prices today
scored a big ""outside day"" down and the bears

get to go home for the weekend with some momentum. While bulls gained
ground on the week, they could not push prices

above very strong resistance located just above the 107 even. 

December S&P 500 futures closed off 0.60 at 1072.50. Bears won the
battle this week with a bearish key reversal down on Wednesday. The
growing anthrax scare spooked traders this week. The news reports
with the poor company earnings and all the company layoffs will
negatively impact trading psychology next week.

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Five weeks removed from arthroscopic knee surgery, the Denver Broncos running back was taken by surprise Wednesday when told of news reports saying he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1186&>, WR NE - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, WR DET - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1028&>, QB GB - Frank Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Hunter Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Giggles Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1151&>, RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Bass/Hull Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Ward missed Monday's practice due to a foot injury. He is expected to miss Sunday's game at Seattle, and isn't a useful Fantasy player at this point in the season. 

Lamar Smith  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1160&>, RB MIA - Neal/McKay Updated 10/23/01 
Smith did not practice Monday due to an ankle injury. He is still expected to play Sunday in Seattle, so don't be afraid to use him this week. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Chiefs Head Coach Dick Vermail said Monday that Minnis might start ahead of Chris Thomas in Thursday's game against Indianapolis. We don't recommend you use either receiver despite the fact that the Colts' secondary is hardly imposing. Neither player is going to be a clear-cut starter this week. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/23/01 
Pathon might miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Don't use him this week. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Wilkins is questionable for Thursday's game at Kansas City due to broken ribs. We don't recommend you use him in a Fantasy league this week. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1097&>, RB DEN - JWillie Updated 10/23/01 
Davis is still targeting Sunday's game against New England as his comeback game from arthroscopic knee surgery, but the Broncos have not decided whether they will activate him. He will work in practice this week and the Broncos hope to know by Wednesday whether Davis can play. We don't recommend you use Davis in a Fantasy league unless it's absolutely certain he's Denver's starting running back and is 100 percent healthy.

Germane Crowell  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=12306&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Duce Staley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1757&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/23/01 
Staley started Monday's game against the N.Y. Giants, but he didn't finish it. Staley carried the ball just three times for 22 yards, and was spelled late in the game by rookie Correll Buckhalter, who gained 34 yards on 11 carries late in the game. At this point, it's tough to depend on Staley to post consistent Fantasy numbers, so consider reserving him if your roster allows for a solid replacement. 

Trung Canidate  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187503&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01 
According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch , Canidate is expected to start in place of Marshall Faulk this weekend against New Orleans. ""I wouldn't expect Marshall to be up for this game,"" coach Mike Martz said. ""He's got to be 100 percent before I would be convinced that we've got to let him play. And if he's not, then he doesn't play."" Canidate proved himself as a worthy replacement last Sunday against the Jets, and should be starting from a Fantasy perspective again this week. 

Keyshawn Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1265&>, Active WR Updated 10/22/01 
Johnson was sidelined for the final minutes of Sunday's game against Pittsburgh due to a right hip flexor strain. He will be limited in practice this week and could miss next Sunday's game against Minnesota. Keep an eye on Johnson's progress this week as you prepare your lineup for Week Seven.

Jerome Bettis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1152&>, Active RB Updated 10/21/01 
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Peter Warrick  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=187401&>, Active WR Updated 10/21/01 
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Daunte Culpepper  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=133263&>, Active QB Updated 10/19/01 
Green Bay's defense has played well so far, but Culpepper won't be intimidated by the Packers. He has faced them many times before, and should fare well in an important divisional game in front of the home crowd.

Tyrone Wheatley  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1140&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/18/01 
The Contra-Costa Times says Wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. Although some sources say Wheatley will miss two to four weeks, Jon Gruden says Wheatley is questionable for Oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that.

Rob Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1033&>, Reserve QB Updated 10/16/01 
Johnson has been listed as probable for Thursday's game in Jacksonville despite a neck injury. He hasn't been a reliable Fantasy quarterback all year, and there's no reason to believe that will change this week. Don't use Johnson.

Raiders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=21&>, Active DT Updated 10/02/01 
The Raiders have lost DE Trace Armstrong for the rest of the season after he tore his Achilles' tendon in Sunday's game against Seattle. He'll have surgery this week and be placed on the injured reserve list shortly thereafter. In other news, DT Roderick Coleman is doubtful for Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys after sustaining a hamstring injury, and DT Grady Jackson is questionable for Sunday after aggravating an injury to his right shoulder. 

Deuce McAllister  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=235228&>, Reserve RB Updated 09/02/01 
McAllister rushed for 108 yards on 19 carries, all in the first half, had a 36-yard punt return in the second half, and caught four passes for 20 yards during Saturday's preseason finale. ""That was probably the best he's run the whole year,"" Saints Head Coach Jim Haslett said. ""I don't think he's where he should be yet, but we're just starting to see what he can do."" While McAllister won't be the Saints' starting running back likely at all this season, he might be a good insurance policy for Ricky Williams owners in Fantasy leagues.

Mike Hollis  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2616&key=1387&>, Active K Updated 07/27/01 
Despite being angry with Jacksonville management, Hollis reported to training camp on time. Hollis, who is having a contractual dispute with the team, boycotted June workouts and doesn't expect to be with the team next year. In any event, Hollis is still a solid kicker and will be one of the first ten placekickers taken in most Fantasy drafts.

"RE: Elizabeth Shim","Mike, 

Would it be possible to keep Liz in our weekend rotation for a while to help Shannon out? All of our new people are starting this week and next week but it takes a while to get them into the weekend rotation. Daniel will probably be ready to go into the rotation in about a month but until then Shannon would have to work every weekend until then. Let me know if that is something we can work out.

Thanks
Patti

"Logistics Commercial Realignment","
After a careful review of the wholesale and retail gas trading and scheduling process it has been decided that the Gas Logistics teams should report directly into the Enron America's Commercial organization. This realignment will help to strengthen the commercial focus and communication between the trading desks and the schedulers and will play a critical role as Enron tries to maximize opportunities and maintain a competitive trading edge. The details are as follows:

Wholesale

Bob Superty will maintain his management of the Logistics support functions which include the Transport Rate team (Kim Olinger), Electronic Commerce team (Tammy Lee-Jaquet) and Regulatory Affairs teams (Suzanne Calcagno). In addition, Bob will now manage the Northeast Logistics team as part of the East desk. Bob will report directly to Scott Neal and will also help coordinate the Logistics function across all regions working closely with each of the regional Logistics Managers, Commercial desk heads and Enron Americas senior management team. 

Victor LaMadrid will manage the Southeast Logistics team and will report directly to Scott Neal. Victor's knowledge and overall east desk experience will be critical to help  maximize east desk opportunities and promote new initiatives across all regions. 

Lisa Kinsey will manage the Central Logistics team and will report directly to Hunter Shively.

Patti Sullivan will manage the West Logistics team and will report directly to Mike Grigsby.

Darren Farmer will manage the Texas Logistics team and will report directly to Tom Martin 

George Smith will manage the Well Head Logistics team and will report directly to Fred Lagrasta.  

Retail 

Donna Greif will now report directly to Don Black. Each of the regional Logistics Managers (East - Marde Driscoll-Ernest, Central - Charlie Muzzy, West - Sabra Dinari) will continue to report directly to Donna. Donna will continue her ongoing efforts in the development and integration of the new retail trading systems, prior period adjustments and development of a strong and talented Logistics team.  


Congratulations to all involved and welcome to the commercial gas team - John Lavorato, President and CEO, Enron Americas.
 _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

<FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Bouman was able to start Sunday's game, but he re-injured his thumb in the first quarter and was replaced by Spergon Wynn. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=1321&""><B>Wesley Walls</B></A>, TE CAR - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Walls was able to play in Sunday's game despite an ankle injury, but he left the game before halftime after spraining his left knee. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=133297&""><B>Martin Gramatica</B></A>, K TB - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

Graham probably won't play Sunday at Kansas City because of the death of his father in a car accident, coach Mike Riley said Friday. If Graham doesn't play, Trevor Gaylor will start in his place and Nate Turner will be signed off the practice squad. The Chargers are already missing their No. 3 receiver, Tim Dwight, due to complications of a collapsed lung. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=1663&""><B>Antowain Smith</B></A>, RB NE - JWillie <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Smith rushed for a career-high 156 yards and a touchdown Saturday. He has been one of the best runners in the AFC and will help carry your team to Fantasy glory.   </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=1069&""><B>Steve McNair</B></A>
, QB TEN - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/23/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>McNair played Saturday despite suffering from back spasms all week. He played well, throwing a touchdown pass in the second half.

He admitted afterwards that he has a cracked rib. He played with extra padding, saying it didn't greatly affect his throws. Garcia might not be at full strength in the remaining weeks but he will still be a solid No. 1 Fantasy QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>

A banged-up Smith hasn't done much statistically in recent weeks.

He isn't very explosive, however, and won't help Fantasy teams much during Weeks 15 through 17.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=235174&""><B>Chris Weinke</B></A>, QB CAR - Tori <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>
Consider Weinke as a backup during the Fantasy playoffs. He lacks the weapons to post better-than-average numbers, but he is a good option if you need an emergency QB. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=12797&""><B>Kurt Warner</B></A>, QB STL - Hunter <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Warner should guide many Fantasy teams to success during the playoffs.

He will be a key player on many title teams, and should never be benched. </FONT></FONT><BR><BR>
<A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=12576&""><B>Randy Moss</B></A>, WR MIN - Russell <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Moss started off slow this season but has once again been one of the best wideouts.

, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Westbrook has been inconsistent this season as a Fantasy player. He will be a good No. 2 at best during your playoffs.</FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=235213&""><B>Rod Gardner</B></A>, WR WAS - Free Agent <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>Gardner has been very inconsistent this season. Unless you play in a deeper league, starting Gardner isn't advisable.  </FONT></FONT><BR><BR><A HREF=""http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=2079&key=1471&""><B>Tony Richardson</B></A>, RB KC - Neal/McKay <FONT SIZE=1>Updated 12/21/01</FONT><BR><FONT FACE=""Arial, Helvetica""><FONT SIZE=2>

      <p>Dear Mike,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Mike Grigsby"" <Mike.Grigsby@enron.com>, who belongs to
list enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->
 <p>The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from
Thanksgiving break.  <b>Congress returns</b> with many lawmakers urging
action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington
Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a <b>long list of legislation ahead
of energy</b> in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but <b>Republicans are
threatening to force a vote through a filibuster</b>.  In turn,
<b>Democrats are saying they'll filibuster</b> any energy bill
containing a provision to open <b>Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to drilling</b>.  The legislation battle continues next week.

<p>Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the
<b>FERC's major decisions</b> regarding how it assesses <b>market
power</b>.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will
impact many of the <b>large and small utilities across the country</b>.


<p>Also next week, we'll see what <b><I>Energy Daily</I> Publisher
Llewellyn King</b> has to say about <b>Pat Wood's performance</b> as
Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about <b>DOE Secretary
Spencer Abraham -</b> on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's
hearing in Washington.

<p>ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week
on a <b>Louisiana company</b> that uses <b>rice hulls to create
power</b>.  <b>Agrilectric Incorporated</b> consumes some of this power,
but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll
have details next week.

<p>Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage
from the <b>Alaska Resources Conference</b> taking place next Thursday
and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the <b>final report
regarding</b> the chosen route of the <b>Arctic natural gas
pipeline</b>.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.

<p>We'll hear from Center for <b>Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Technologies Executive Director John White</b> next week.  ENL's Kym
McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's <b>opposition
to the state's long-term power contracts</b>.  Catch White from the West
Coast bureau next week.

<p>Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:

<p>Crude: $18.96    	
<br>Unleaded: $0.5273	
<br>Heating Oil: $0.5342	
<br>Natural Gas: $2.813	

<p>Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.
Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue
to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
<b>Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.</b>

<p><b>Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.</b>

Gridiron Guru 

Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com <mailto:gridguru@commissioner.com>. You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself! 

Question - Chris Trautman, LaCrosse, WI 

I am stuck on my last starter. Should I go with Shaun Alexander or 3 WRs and start Marty Booker? Alexander ripped it up at home two weeks ago and he is at home again versus a good Miami team, but Booker should be featured more since Marcus Robinson went down for the season. 

Answer - GG 

Alexander has been a revelation in his first two starts, but now he faces a team that may not back down to him. The Dolphins have a superb run defense that should not be judged by its recent failures against Marshall Faulk and Curtis Martin. Miami will be fired up to face Alexander, who may have his first forgettable game as a starter. Booker will face an underrated San Francisco secondary, and is not destined to have a big day. Neither player seems like a great start, but we recommend Alexander because he may score a late TD if the Seahawks have to play catch-up against a Miami team that gives them all kinds of matchup problems. 


Question - Mark MacKay, San Diego, CA 

Should I start Rod Gardner or Ike Hilliard this week? Rod had a good Week Six, but Ike is looking better each week. 

Answer - GG 

Gardner's huge day means two things. One, he gains instant Fantasy notice. Two, his next opponent will be geared to shut him down after extensive film study. The Giants have been very solid defensively, and will be one of the better units the rookie has seen so far. Hilliard is quickly recapturing his old form, and might be the Giants' No. 1 receiver if Amani Toomer is benched. He'll be facing Champ Bailey though, so Hilliard is not due for a big week. Neither player looks like a great start, but we'll go with Hilliard because of his experience and continuing improvement. 


Question - John Kersey, Denver, CO 

I have already decided to start LaDainian Tomlinson. Who should I start as my No. 2 RB - Jason Brookins, Anthony Thomas or Mike Anderson? 

Answer - GG 

Brookins is the best back on the Baltimore roster, but the Ravens are still not showing a lot of confidence in him, so he is a risky start. It is difficult to sit Thomas after the breakout game he had last week, but he will face a respectable run defense. Anderson will start against a Patriots team that has been surprisingly effective against the run at times. In such a case, we recommend sticking with the hotter player, and that would be Thomas. 


  _____  

Tip of the Week 

Walter Mathis, Pompano Beach, FL: Remember that football is a game that is fueled by emotion. Sometimes, emotions override matchups. Curtis Martin will always rip holes in the Miami defense. Lamar Smith will be fired up to face the Seahawks this week, because he began his career in Seattle. And in divisional games, big players do well. Don't be surprised if Eddie George comes up big against Pittsburgh.

"Electric Power Daily","Mike,
Check out article in today's electric power daily.  DWR is having problems with bond issue and has yet to forward hedge gas exposure.
Frank


Also in the new filing, DWR lowered its estimate for
revenue from off-system power sales to $191-million from
$477-million. Nichols said the change reflected similar
volume, but less return given falling power prices. He said
he could not estimate exactly how much power the agency
will sell on the market.
Nichols added that DWR has yet to enter into natural
gas hedges to lower some contract prices, because the
agency is unsure it has the legal right to do so.

I just spoke to Elizabeth.  I told her that we would move her out of Trading Track and in to the Analyst pool.  I also told her about setting a performance plan going forward and that you would be contacting her.  She knows that she will be working as an Analyst for the west.
 
I will complete the plan and forward to you.

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Tim Biakabutuka  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1082&>, RB CAR - Tomaski Updated 10/25/01 
Biakabutuka will be out until at least training camp with a fracture and other structural damage to his right foot. ""He's not going to be really ready to do any work that would be football related until next summer,"" coach George Seifert said Wednesday. ""Basically, it just separated,"" Seifert said of the top part of Biakabutuka's foot. ""The ligaments, tendons and bone broke, so it all had to be put back together."" Richard Huntley, who will replace Biakabutuka in the starting lineup, visited his teammate at the hospital Tuesday. Huntley said the injury was far worse than he expected and he's concerned Biakabutuka won't play again. 

James Stewart  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1116&>, RB DET - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/25/01 
Stewart will probably play on Sunday against the Bengals. The Detroit Free Press reports that his ankle injury has now been identified as a bad bruise and not a sprain. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/25/01 
Chrebet, the New York Jets' top receiver, will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. He was hit in the helmet by St. Louis Rams' defensive tackle Brian Young on Sunday and left the game complaining of dizziness. It was the second consecutive week that a head injury knocked Chrebet out of the game. He left the Jets' win over Miami in the second half on Oct. 14. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Laveranues Coles will be the top receiver in his absence. Rookie Kevin Swayne will move ino the starting lineup. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Davis disputed rumors that he may have a stress fracture in his leg and could be lost for the season. ""At this point in time, I'm on schedule to play this Sunday,"" Davis said. Davis, who has missed five games this year and 29 since 1999, admitted that his right knee remains sore, but he has been well enough to play on the scout team the past two weeks. He remained on the scout team Wednesday as the Broncos prepared for this week's game against the New England Patriots. Davis was listed as questionable on the weekly injury report. Don't bother to start him. His abilities will be limited if he does play Sunday. 

Clint Stoerner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=196727&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Starting quarterback Anthony Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and might not play Sunday. Head coach Dave Campo said Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf, if Wright isn't ready to play. Using Stoerner in your starting lineup would be a risky move. Stoerner, a second-year player from Arkansas, has never started in the NFL. He has played in only three games, completing 4 of 7 passes for 44 yards and two touchdowns in his two appearances this season. 

Anthony Wright  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=134342&>, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wright didn't practice Wednesday because of fluid on his right knee, and coach Dave Campo indicated Wright might not play Sunday. Wright expected to have results of an MRI exam Thursday, and Campo said he wouldn't make a final decision on the quarterback's playing status for the Arizona game until after that. Campo said Clint Stoerner would start ahead of Ryan Leaf if Wright isn't ready to play Sunday. Campo said there was a good chance that Leaf could play for the Cowboys on Sunday. Leaf apparently hasn't been with the team long enough to merit a starting spot yet. 

Terrell Davis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1097&>, RB DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Davis is sufficiently healed from a knee injury, but now his lower left leg is giving him problems and will probably keep him out of action this week. X-rays revealed no stress fracture, says the Denver Post , but Davis' leg is throbbing. Mike Anderson will retain the starting job for now. If Davis is able to play, which seems unlikely, he will be very limited. 

Amani Toomer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1262&>, WR NYG - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01 
According to published reports, Toomer might be benched in favor of WR Joe Jurevicius. Ike Hilliard will join Jurevicius if Toomer is demoted. Toomer caught only three passes Monday night against the Eagles and did not have a reception for more than 10 yards. Head coach Jim Fassel demoted Toomer last season, in an effort to motivate him. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/24/01 
Chrebet will miss Sunday's game at Carolina with a head injury. Coach Herman Edwards described Chrebet's ailment as ""post-trauma migraines"" and said he wanted to be extra cautious with the injury. Edwards said Chrebet passed the various tests and scans he was given. Chrebet will be replaced by Kevin Swayne, a 26-year-old rookie who played in both the Arena League and the XFL during the past year. He has now been playing football for 40 straight weeks and has one catch for 19 yards in the NFL. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Sanders will not require surgery on his back. He will be re-evaluated after receiving an injection. His return date is unclear. 

Bert Emanuel  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1186&>, WR NE - McKay Updated 10/24/01 
Emanuel signed with the Detroit Lions on Wednesday. While the Lions are looking for a receiver to help fill the void created by a season-ending injury to Germane Crowell, Emanuel won't get the first crack at the job. Don't bother picking him up. 

Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee. 

Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, WR DET - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season. 

Santana Moss  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235234&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
The New York Daily News says there is still a noticeable hitch in Moss' stride as he rceovers from knee surgery. The earliest the Jets expect him to return is Dec. 2. 

Brett Favre  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1028&>, QB GB - The Rocks Updated 10/24/01 
Favre skipped Tuesday's practice due to general soreness. With Green Bay on the bye this week, expect him to be fully recovered in time for Week Eight. 

Marvin Minnis  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=235122&>, WR KC - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Early indications this week were Minnis would return to the starting lineup. But the Kansas City Star notes Chris Thomas is still working with the first team in practice. There is no official word on which player will start on Thursday against the Colts. 

Larry Foster  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Detroit Free Press , Foster is expected to start in Germane Crowell's place Sunday against Cincinnati. Foster is an inexperienced wideout not worthy of picking up in Fantasy leagues right now. Monitor his progress over the next few weeks. 

Marcus Robinson  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1676&>, WR CHI - Hardtail Amigos Updated 10/24/01 
The Bears placed Robinson on injured reserve on Tuesday with torn ligaments in his left knee, effectively ending his season. Drop him unless you play in a keeper league. 

Neil Rackers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187627&>, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
According to the Cincinnati Enquirer , the Bengals worked out three kickers, and did not sign one. Rackers' job is temporarily safe, but he is a big Fantasy risk because of his erratic play. 

Todd Pinkston  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187621&>, WR PHI - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Pinkston has a strained wrist but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He will be evaluated on a day to day basis. 

Ron Dixon  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=187527&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Dixon missed Monday game because of a sprained ankle. He has made progress in his recovery and might play this week. 

Joe Jurevicius  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12484&>, WR NYG - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Ike Hilliard regained his starting position Monday, returning Jurevicius to the role of a reserve. Jurevicius was productive as a starter in Hilliard's absence. However, he will be useless as the No. 3 receiver. There is a chance that he could return to starting lineup and replace Amani Toomer. Toomer has been inconsistent this season. Jurevicius played alongside Hilliard a few times in Sunday's game while Toomer stood on the sidelines. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Swinton is suffering from a hamstring injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against Arizona. ""He [Swinton] worked with the trainers on Monday and did some things, but he didn't do enough to say for sure he will be available,"" said head coach Dave Campo. Darrin Chiaverini and Raghib Ismail will get more playing time in his absence. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Grigsby Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Darrin Chiaverini  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133247&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/24/01 
Chiaverini practiced Monday and is listed as probable for Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He is recovering from a left knee injury. 

Raghib Ismail  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1201&>, WR DAL - Pink Panthers Updated 10/24/01 
Ismail, recovering from a sprained knee, practiced Monday without any problems. He is listed as probable for this week's game. 

Ricky Watters  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1151&>, RB SEA - McKay Updated 10/23/01 
According to the Tacoma News Tribune , Seahawks Head Coach Mike Holmgren says that Watters will return to the starting lineup as soon as he's healthy, which could be another month or longer. ""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Holmgren said. ""I would be surprised if I didn't insert Ricky back into the lineup. He was our best player when he got hurt. Shaun (Alexander) has come in and played well. But I would suspect that when Ricky can play, he'll play again."" If you have the roster room, it would be a good idea to stash both backs on your team to ensure you're safe if Watters takes the job back from Alexander down the stretch. 

Trent Dilfer  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1065&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Dilfer was unable to practice on Monday due to a groin injury. He has lost the starting QB job to Matt Hasselbeck, and shouldn't be on any Fantasy rosters at this point. 

Matt Hasselbeck  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12429&>, QB SEA - Free Agent Updated 10/23/01 
Hasselbeck will be the Seahawks' starting quarterback for Sunday's game against Miami, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer . He replaces Trent Dilfer, who stood in for Hasselbeck as he was sidelined with a pulled groin. This isn't a very favorable matchup for Hasselbeck from a Fantasy perspective, so don't use him this week. 

Wayne Chrebet  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1263&>, WR NYJ - Tomaski Updated 10/23/01 
The Jets have listed Chrebet as questionable for next Sunday's game at Carolina. He will have an MRI on Tuesday to determine the extent of the concussion he suffered Sunday against the Rams.

Grigsby Player News 

Germane Crowell  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12306&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
The Detroit Lions placed Crowell on injured reserve on Tuesday with a torn patella tendon in his left knee, which ends his season.

Hines Ward  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12795&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/24/01 
Ward is day to day with an ankle injury. He is listed as probable for Monday's game against Tennessee.

Joey Galloway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1286&>, Active WR Updated 10/24/01 
Galloway is listed as questionable for this week's game against the Cardinals, but the Cowboys are optimistic about his chances of playing. He is recovering from a sprained foot. ""We're expecting some limited practice tomorrow, so I would say he is questionable from the standpoint that it will depend on how he improves the next two or three days,"" said head coach Dave Campo. 

Marshall Faulk  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1109&>, Active RB Updated 10/23/01 
According to Head Coach Mike Martz, Faulk is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. ""I'm just taking the same posture that we did a week ago,"" Martz said. ""I would not expect Marshall to be up (active) for this game. He's got to be 100 percent before I'll be convinced that we've got to let him play."" Trung Canidate would once again start in Faulk's absence is he's unable to go. 

Tiki Barber  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1782&>, Reserve RB Updated 10/22/01 
Barber, who is probable with a hamstring injury, is expected to play Monday night against Philadelphia. Still, he will not get many carries, as Ron Dayne is expected to get the bulk of the work. Barber might be on the verge of losing the starting job outright for the remainder of the season.

Peyton Manning  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=12531&>, Active QB Updated 10/18/01 
Manning did not perform well the first time he faced New England. He was intercepted by the Patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week.

Peerless Price  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=133393&>, Reserve WR Updated 10/18/01 
Price might post respectable numbers against the Jaguars. Jacksonville's secondary is thin because of injuries.

Charlie Garner  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1149&>, Active RB Updated 10/17/01 
The Contra-Costa Times points out Garner has apparently supplanted Tyrone Wheatley as the team's ""workhorse"" back. The trend was apparent before Wheatley was reported to miss three to four weeks with a knee injury.

Jaguars  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=13&>, Active DT Updated 09/23/01 
Jacksonville's defense was solid once again, holding the Tennessee Titans to just six points on Sunday. They've allowed a total of nine points in their first two games of the season, and are worth picking up should they still be available in your league. 

Chargers  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=24&>, Reserve DT Updated 08/19/01 
Defensive end Marcellus Wiley missed Saturday's game against the Miami Dolphins due to a sore hamstring. Defensive tackle Jamal Williams suffered a sprained knee in the game and could miss up to three weeks, and cornerback Alex Molden sustained a slight groin injury. None of these injuries are considered serious. San Diego made some improvements to their defensive unit during the offseason, and might be worth using when your starting defense has a bye week. 

Carl Pickens  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1211&>, Active WR Updated 05/30/01 
Weakened by a chronic hamstring problem that was showing no improvement over the offseason, Pickens has decided to retire after eight NFL seasons. Pickens, 31, signed a one-year, $500,000 contract earlier this spring with the Dallas Cowboys. But, after missing all of the minicamps and visiting with noted Birmingham, Ala., orthopedist James Andrews he decided to end his career. 

Troy Aikman  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1019&>, Reserve QB Updated 04/09/01 
Aikman has decided to retire. Two sources close to Aikman said the 12-year veteran, released by the Cowboys last month, will officially announce his retirement at a Monday afternoon news conference. 

Brett Conway  <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=/mp/player-news&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4517&key=1385&>, Active K Updated 12/22/00 
Head Coach Al Groh won't make a decision until Sunday, but a source close to the Jets says that Groh is leaning towards using Conway for placekicking and Hall for kickoffs. Either way, Fantasy owners should avoid using either of the Jets' kickers in their final week of the season.

Player Updates NFL Reports  	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News 

Edgerrin James  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=133320&>, RB IND - JWillie Updated 10/26/01 
James sprained his left knee in the fourth quarter of Thursday's game at Kansas City. He did not return, and was replaced by Dominic Rhodes, who scored the Colts' final TD on a 77-yard run. James remained on the sidelines after leaving the game. 

Derrick Alexander  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1191&>, WR KC - JWillie Updated 10/25/01 
Alexander suffered an injury to his ribs prior to Thursday's game vs. Indianapolis. He did not play, and Larry Parker and Marvin Minnis saw most of the work in two receiver sets. 

James Hodgins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=146331&>, RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Hodgins is suffering from a toe injury and is questionable for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He won't be used much in the Rams offense even if he is healthy. 

Dave Stachelski  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=187759&>, TE NO - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Saints released Stachelski Wednesday. He caught just one pass this season for five yards. 

Michael Bennett  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=235196&>, RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Bennett missed practice Wednesday and is listed as questionable on the injury report. He is making progress in his recovery, but his owners should reserve him on their roster. Head coach Dennis Green hasn't given any indication that he will use Bennett this week. 

Todd Heap  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=235215&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Heap is optimistic about playing in Sunday's game against the Jaguars. However, he has been inactive since Week Two and is listed as questionable on the injury report. Consider reserving him this week. 

Anthony Thomas  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Martin Updated 10/25/01 
Thomas has been named the starter for Sunday's game. He has a case of turf toe but the injury is not considered to be serious. Thomas is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Kevin Swayne  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1677&>, WR NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swayne will start at wideout in place of the injured Wayne Chrebet. Consider using Swayne if you need a third receiver to start this week. 

Reggie Swinton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=12748&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Swinton is still recovering from a hamstring injury and will be re-evaluated after practice on Thursday. Swinton won't have much Fantasy value if he is healthy. 

Dedric Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1711&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Ward has been ruled out of Sunday's game at Seattle. He is still recovering from a foot injury. 

Terry Allen  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1177&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 10/25/01 
Allen practiced Wednesday but remains questionable for this week's game, according to The Baltimore Sun . Jason Brookins will start Sunday if Allen is inactive. 

Jason Brookins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Brookins has a minor shoulder injury but is expected to play this Sunday. He might actually start this week in place of the injured Terry Allen. Nevertheless, he is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Shannon Sharpe  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1329&>, TE BAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Sharpe is recovering from a leg injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as probable on the injury report. 

Freddie Jones  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1843&>, TE SD - Neal/McKay Updated 10/25/01 
Jones has a sprained ankle but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed as questionable on the injury report. 

Hines Ward  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Tori Updated 10/25/01 
Ward missed practice Wednesday because of a foot injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game. He is listed on the injury report as probable. 

Joey Galloway  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1286&>, WR DAL - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Galloway's status for Sunday's game will be determined after Thursday's practice. He is suffering from a foot injury that he suffered in the Cowboys' previous game. 

Charlie Batch  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=12204&>, QB DET - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Batch was given the day off Wednesday, because of a sore arm. However, The Detroit Free Press reports that he is still expected to play Sunday against the Bengals. 

O.J. McDuffie  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1246&>, WR MIA - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Don't expect McDuffie to play again this season. The Miami Herald reports that he is still suffering from pain in his surgically repaired toe. McDuffie missed most of last season as well because of the injury. 

Terrence Wilkins  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=146366&>, WR IND - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Wilkins will not play in Sunday's game. He has been ruled out because of broken ribs. 

Jerome Pathon  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=12612&>, WR IND - Tori Updated 10/25/01 
Pathon will miss his third straight game Thursday at Kansas City due to a sprained right foot. Rookie Reggie Wayne will replace him in the starting lineup. 

Terry Glenn  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1254&>, WR NE - Matty Updated 10/25/01 
Glenn's status for Sunday's game is uncertain, according to The Boston Globe . He did some running but did not practice Wednesday. Glenn is still recovering from a hamstring injury and the Patriots want to see how his leg holds up before activating him Sunday. 

Drew Bledsoe  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
The Boston Globe reports that there is a possibility that Bledsoe might be able to fill in as the emergency QB Sunday. Although he is still under his playing weight, he has begun throwing and doing individual passing drills. 

Chad Morton  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=187613&>, RB NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Morton might be able to play this Sunday, according to The Bergen Record . He has missed the past three games because of an ankle sprain. 

Marco Battaglia  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1324&>, TE CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Battaglia is listed on the injury report as probable. He has a calf injury but is expected to play in Sunday's game at Detroit. 

Chad Johnson  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=235222&>, WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Johnson is making progress in his recovery from a broken clavicle, but The Cincinnati Enquirer reports that he will be sidelined for several more weeks. Ron Dugans will fill in as the third receiver in his absence. 

Chris Sanders  <http://football222.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=49699.10&random=3675&key=1306&>, WR TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/25/01 
Sanders has responded well to back treatment and might play Monday, according to The Nashville Tennessean . However, Sanders is used as a third receiver on a run-oriented team and won't be too productive even if he is healthy.

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Player Updates NFL Reports

Latest NFL Player News

Corey Bradford <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12234&>, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Bradford started in place of the injured Bill Schroeder but was ineffective at Minnesota, catching four passes for only 32 yards. Bradford has yet to prove himself as a Fantasy player.

Bubba Franks <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187388&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Franks caught only two passes for nine yards, but one of his receptions was good for a two-yard TD. Franks has caught TD passes in five of six games this year and has become a major scoring thr! ea! t even though he is not very effective outside of the red zone.

Derrick Alexander <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1191&>, WR KC - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01
Alexander finally had a big game, posting 99 yards receiving and a touchdown against Arizona. He's been unreliable for the most part, however, but his potential to post numbers this good makes it tough to bench him. 

Trent Green <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1599&>, QB KC - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Green threw for 352 yards and a score in Sunday's 24-16 loss to Arizona. Green has been inconsistent this season, however, and no longer warrants a starting nod every week. 

Doug Chapman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/el! in! k?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187510&> , RB MIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Chapman rushed for 90 yards on 22 carries against the Packers. His numbers were not great, but he was more effective than Michael Bennett has been so far. Chapman may continue to see a good amount of carries if Bennett cannot stay healthy or continues to struggle.

David Boston <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133230&>, WR ARI - Tomaski Updated 10/21/01
Boston had a big game against Kansas City, posting seven receptions for 131 yards and a score. He's emerging as one of the best receivers in the league and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Michael ! Pi! ttman <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12623&>, RB ARI - Top Dogs Updated 10/21/01
Pittman had a great outing on Sunday against Kansas City, posting 137 yards of total offense and a touchdown. Pittman won't post numbers this good with any regularity, but he's still a valuable player to have on your roster. 

Jeff Graham <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1264&>, WR SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Graham came up huge for San Diego on Sunday, catching seven passes for 107 yards and two scores against Denver. He's still not reliable enough to start on a regular basis, but he's certainly worth a roster spot. 

LaDainian Tomlinson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235249&>, RB SD - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Tomlinson was held in check for the first time this season by Denver on Sunday. The rookie tailback rushed for only 58 yards on the day, but he's still one of the top Fantasy players in the league. 

Desmond Clark <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=133250&>, TE DEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Clark had a big game on Sunday, catching six passes for 54 yards and a score against San Diego. He's been reliable as far as tight ends go from a Fantasy perspective, so continue to start him on a weekly basis. 

Brian Griese <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12409&>, QB DEN - TayDang Updated 10/21/01
Griese (shoulder) started Sunday's game against San Diego, but he was ineffective. He posted 212 yards passing, a touchdown and two interceptions in Denver's 27-10 loss. 

Peter Warrick <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.c! om! /mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187401&> , WR CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Warrick caught eight passes for 84 yards against Chicago. But the potentially explosive wideout is hurting his owners, because he does not find the end zone often. 

Corey Dillon <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1681&>, RB CIN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
The Bears held Dillon to just 30 yards on 16 carries. Expect the veteran runner to bounce back from such a quiet performance very quickly.

David Terrell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235247&>, WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Terrell caught seven passes for 91 ! ya! rds against Cincinnati. With Marcus Robinson injured, Terrell should assume a more prominent role in the Chicago passing game. 

Anthony Thomas <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235248&>, RB CHI - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Thomas rushed for 188 yards and a TD against Cincinnati, clearly establishing himself as Chicago's top RB. Expect him to be the Bears' featured back for the rest of the year.

Frank Wycheck <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1372&>, TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Wycheck caught seven passes for 100 yards and a TD at Detroit. Despite some quiet outings until this week, he remains a top-notch Fantasy TE, especially with the Titans lacking in talent at wide receiver.

Charlie Batch <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.! co! m/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=12204&> , QB DET - Pink Panthers Updated 10/21/01
Batch threw for 338 yards, three TDs and was intercepted once in a loss to Tennessee. Batch has stacked up good numbers in two consecutive weeks, but he remains a Fantasy risk because of his history of inconsistency.

Steve McNair <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1069&>, QB TEN - McKay Updated 10/21/01
McNair threw for 216 yards, a TD and was intercepted twice at Detroit. He completed only 15 of 35 attempts, and many of his throws were inaccurate, possibly indicating he still might be bothered by shoulder problems.

Eddie George <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1174&>, RB TEN - Fear! Updated 10/21/01
George was held to 51 yards on 26 carries by Detroit. The lack of a reliable passing game in Tennessee has certainly hindered his production this year. 

Shawn Jefferson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1255&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jefferson caught three passes for 67 yards and a TD against the Saints. The speedy wideout has a long history of inconsistency, so don't expect good numbers from him every week.

Alge Crumpler <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235206&>, TE ATL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Crumpler caught five passes for 78 yards and a TD against New Orleans. Expect good totals from the big, quick ! ti! ght end for the remainder of the year.

Albert Connell <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1851&>, WR NO - FJS Updated 10/21/01
Connell caught only one pass for five yards against Atlanta. It is definitely time to give up on the disappointing wideout.

Willie Jackson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1234&>, WR NO - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Jackson finished with only 46 receiving yards on five catches against the Falcons. Mediocre numbers against the low-quality Atlanta defense indicate Jackson is not capable of providing owners with regularly good numbers.

Hines Ward <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4! 09! 4&key=12795&>, WR PIT - Grigsby Updated 10/21/01
Ward was limited to 44 yards on three catches by Tampa Bay. Ward is still making important receptions for the Steelers, but his Fantasy appeal is limited because of Pittsburgh's inability to consistently score in the air.

Warrick Dunn <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1171&>, RB TB - TexOK Updated 10/21/01
Dunn played despite a foot injury that had bothered him during the week, but he was limited to 31 yards on 13 carries by a physical Pittsburgh defense.

Anthony Becht <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187740&>, TE NYJ - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Becht had a huge game against St.! L! ouis, posting five catches for 35 yards and two scores. He's been inconsistent this season, however, but his potential to post good numbers makes him worth starting at a position lacking quality players. 

Keyshawn Johnson <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1265&>, WR TB - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01
Johnson caught 10 passes for 159 yards against Pittsburgh. He has developed a good on-field relationship with QB Brad Johnson. The veteran wideout should continue to post high-quality numbers on a regular basis.

Jerome Bettis <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=1152&>, RB PIT - The Rocks Updated 10/21/01
Bettis rushed for 143 yards and a TD on 17 carries against Tampa Bay. He also threw a 32-yard TD pass. His fine outing proves Bettis can compile good numbers against any defense.

Trung Canidate <http://football210.fantasy.spo! rt! sline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=187503&> , RB STL - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Canidate had a huge game against the New York Jets, posting 232 yards of total offense and two scores. His role as the Rams' featured back may be short-lived, however, depending on the health of stud back Marshall Faulk. 

Rod Gardner <http://football210.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=ee&owner=96876.9&random=4094&key=235213&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 10/21/01
Gardner had a huge game on Sunday, posting six catches for 208 yards and a score against Carolina. He seems to have overtaken Michael Westbrook as the No. 1 receiving target in Washington, and is worth a roster spot from a Fantasy perspective.

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.
 
Thanks

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.
 
Anne

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

<2> 	Weekly Market Wrap
_____________________________________________________________________

Dear Trader:

Markets slumped this week as the anthrax scare widened and
traders took an increasingly gloomy view of the impact of
the September terrorist attacks on global economies.
Copper futures, a leading indicator, sank close to fresh
lows, and Debt futures ended weak.  However, while Stocks
finished the week lower, they managed a Friday rebound, and
the Dollar started to look stronger.  Bottom line though?
Traders are still very nervous.  Crude Oil did a see-saw,
rallying late on production cut hopes after sliding during
the week, while Natural Gas advanced on the basis of a
forecast that the coming winter would be cooler than the
warm winters of the late 90's.  Huge supplies and great
weather continued to depress Corn and Soybeans, while Wheat
rebounded on firm cash and export hopes.  Sugar had a late
surge, but Cocoa sold off ahead of new-crop shipments,
Coffee fell back after a failed rally, and Cotton sank on
ideal harvest conditions.  Hogs and Bellies closed on the
weak side, Cattle mixed.

"Chris Bell for Mayor","If you are still contemplating your choice for Mayor, please read the
following endorsement for Chris Bell, candidate for Mayor and a personal
friend. Chris possesses the intelligence, leadership, and integrity to
represent Houston.  I encourage you to vote for Chris on election day.


Please forward to your friends, neighbors, family, and co-workers.

Endorsement of the Kingwood Observer:

MAYOR - Chris Bell

The mayoral race has been a tough one to call. We have wrestled with this
difficult decision. During interviews and forums, how do we really know who
will be the best leader? The three who came to meet with us would probably
all make a good mayor. For the most part, they agree on the problems which
make up the challenges of the future: air pollution, ground to surface water
conversion, potholes, traffic, equal division of tax dollars, mass transit,
emergency services. They all care about the city.

But how to choose, without the influence of political affiliation? Past
behavior and character. On that basis, Chris Bell is the best candidate.

The Observer has endorsed Bell before, when he was running for council. He
is probably the most intelligent of the three major contenders. He has a
quick wit and readily quips that he has held the three least regarded
professions : journalist, lawyer and politician.

Most importantly, he does not make promises he cannot or will not keep. He
has never lied to the Kingwood voter. He did not vote for annexation - he
was not on council during that acrimonious time.

He supports a tax rebate at the end of the fiscal year, he has a
well-thought out traffic management plan and a three-point plan for
improving the Houston Fire Department resources. He supports a vote on any
expansion to Metro's light rail system, although he wisely does not support
stopping the seven-mile project that is already begun. His focus is the
taxpayer as the customer, and the customer drives the services.

He sees the big picture and has the intelligence to lead wisely. He is not
favored by either political party, a good thing in our opinion, and points
out that in this time of national crisis, leaders who can bring diverse
needs and people together will be the best leader.

Bell's major opponent did vote for annexation. He misled Kingwood citizens,
for nearly 18 months, by saying he had not decided on his annexation vote.
In his Observer interview, he admitted that he traded his yes vote on
annexation to then-mayor Bob Lanier in exchange for his ""promise"" to provide
equal services before he was ever elected!

This is fishy reasoning. First, equal services are guaranteed by state law,
not by mayoral promises. Second, the promise was more likely support for his
council bid.

He sold us out before we ever knew his name and then mislead us again and
again. Dishonesty is a character flaw, not a behavior.

Elect Chris Bell mayor. He is the breath of fresh air City Hall needs.

"RE: Booking New Deals","No problem.  I need to talk to Keith, but it looks like the Price desk may have a process that would work for us.

Subject:	Booking New Deals

Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we found last week.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.

The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.

 << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >> 

The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:

1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;
2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;
3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk. 

Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

I will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesday morning.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

"FERC Initial Decision in Hearing on TW Negotiated Rate Deals","FERC today issued an Initial Decision in the hearing in the Transwestern case concerning several negotiated rate agreements to which Indicated Shippers and the CPUC had raised objections.  Briefly, the Judge ruled that Transwestern had not exercised market power and that the capacity was advertised and awarded in accordance with Transwestern's tariff.  However, Transwestern must modify its tariff to add a separate provision where all the posting, bidding and award procedures for purposes of awarding capacity are clearly stated.  A highlighted copy of the ruling is attached for your information.
