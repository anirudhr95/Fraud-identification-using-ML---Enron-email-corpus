Just want to check on the variable rate spreadsheet that you are working on.  Also, can you please change the Keystone page in the west packet to show total supply in the Permian basin with all delivery points to exporting pipelines (EPNG, Northern, Valero, TW).  Right now it just shows receipts into EPNG.

Please look at the attached spreadsheet.  It is a manual sheet that shows total EOL trades by trader.  Can we automate this sheet so that we can monitor by day?

Please respond when you get a chance.  Let me know if this is unclear.

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the

January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a ""Gas Accord II""
application.

Our move date is set for Friday, 11/9/01.  At this time they will be moving the gas trading group to the 6th floor and the gas operations group to the 5th floor.  They will follow with the power groups on the following Friday, 11/16/01.

Assistants: Please be ready to submit a churn on this Friday 10/5/01 for your individual groups (I will let you know if this changes and once I am certain of the seat numbers for your groups, I will give them to you). I will also need to give you your mail stop locations at the new building, which I am working on now with the mailroom.  In the meantime, from now till we move, please start cleaning up your areas and your groups areas and discarding anything that isn't needed.  It has been requested that only 6 boxes per person be moved because space is limited.  So we need to decide what can be sent to archives.  I will send you some forms for this. Please come to me with any questions.

Deskheads:  Unless, there is any changes from the office of the chair, I will set up a meeting with each one of you on Thursday to make sure you have no changes to your seating.  Once the churn is submitted there can not be any changes other than new additions to the group or deletions from the group.  This is to prevent there being any mixups when installing equipment at the new building.

Subject:	Pipeline Cutoffs

Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:

We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct ""fool-proof"" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:

Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the ""scheduled quantity"" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.

I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Chris

Mike,

We have a deal  for the City of Pasadena at Socal for a volume of 3000 a day and to SMUD at Malin for a volume of 15,000 a day. At Socal, they sold gas back to us and we are netting it against that deal. At Malin, through the 6th, the gas has been flowing 100%, but today there is a small cut and Suzanne is checking into it. Those are the only 2 west desk deals. 

Thanks,

Subject:	APEA Gas Prepay Transaction 

I have gotten a call from Roger Mock, CEO of American Public Energy Agency, regarding a series of transactions.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

Does this need to be done before the move because inventory has already been taken at everyone's desk and it has been requested that no changes are made before we move unless necessary.  If yes, I will have it done beginning of next week and will take care of everything.

Hi Mike,

First of all, I would like to thank you
for the opportunities you presented
to me on the West desk.  Were it
not for the current situation I think it 
could have been a great way to
approach west gas trading.

Since you are busy I thought it would be
better to tell you via e-mail:  I was wondering
if you could consider me in the next round
of layoffs.  I do not know exactly how this is 
decided on the management level, but
if the topic ever comes up please bring up my name.
I have had a great time at Enron, and of making
your acquaintance, but I feel at  this point I would like to
pursue another path.

Thank you.

Subject:	West Fundies

Mike,

Following is a west fundies update.  We have not yet produced an abundance of finished product, but several great projects are in the development stage.  These projects are making nice progress even though it may not be visible to the casual observer.

PRODUCTION

This effort is being led by Tori and supported by both Jay and myself.  Gaskill's staff will be providing most of the manpower.  The concept is to design a model which takes a methodical and scientific approach in forecasting: (1) declines of existing production,  (2) increases due to drilling. 

Existing production

Using externally provided production data, we are in the process of dividing production into zones of like characteristics.  Each zone will be identified by: Basin --> Reservoir --> Formation.  Analysis will be done at the zone level to determine its unique depletion curve.  This curve will be extrapolated to forecast future production from existing wells.

New production

From rig count data (or completion data if we buy the more expensive database) we can determine which ""zone"" a new well is targeting.  Forecasted production can then be determined by applying a recent historical success ratio and the corresponding depletion curve identified in the preceding step.  The difficult component to forecast with great accuracy is future drilling.  Our current thinking is a calculation that considers forward prices, drilling costs (which are increasing since all the ""easy wells"" have already been drilled), and common required rates of return.

Unresolved

Determining the specific plants which will be affected by depletions and new drilling is an unresolved issue.  The reciepient plant for new drilling may be identified in public records or we may be able to use rig coordinates to determine the closest and most likely plant.  Depletions may be more difficult as I am unsure if the well data can be readily cross-referenced with the corresponding plants.

DEMAND

This effort is being led by Mat Smith and supported by Jason Huang and myself.  Our near-term goals are to refine the existing California model and to develop similar models for the PNW, DSW, and RM.

Jason Wolfe is facilitating data collection and interpretation for the PNW.  I will likely recruit Billianna to follow suit in the DSW.  Jason Huang is moving to Gaskill's group, however, he will still have some involvement in this project.  I still intend on recruiting an individual from the research group, but feel that it is best to have the other regions ""framed"" (ie: model built) prior to bringing that person aboard.  His role will be to refine our technique and mathematics.

Data collection and interpretation

Much of the needed data is already in place, however some work remains.  Our existing NWPL histories consist of a handfull of compressor flows; demand is calculated by subtracting the downstream flow from the upstream flow.  This ""rough""  method works, but the downsides are: (1) this calculated number includes changes in line pack and therfore true demand is hidden; (2) we are forced to break NWPL into arbitrary regions determined by the placement of compressors.  Jason W. is working on collecting flows at every meter on the pipe.  This will afford a much more accurate reading of true demand devoid of linepack changes and significantly better regression analysis will result.  Jason is also looking at a more meaningful way of dividing the pipe into demand zones.

El Paso's system does not provide flows at individual meters, but we have recently discovered that several years of actual flows for pre-determined zones are available.  (Phoenix area, Tucson area, and El Paso City area).  Monique was working on uploading this data into our database.  I think Bilianna can pick up where Monique left off.

An ongoing process will be to drill into the various demand zones to gain a better understanding of specific drivers of that demand.  ie: weather sensitive load, industrial load and related economic factors, etc...

PNW, DSW, and RM regression analsysis

Two hurdles have prevented us from moving forward on this front.  First, the data collection discussed above-- this process should be complete within two weeks.  Second, our intention is to use Portland's power demand forecasts as a variable in our gas demand models.  Mat Smith needs to visit Portland to gain a comprehensive understanding of these load forecasts.  He has a trip scheduled for the end of October.

Provided things go according to plan, we should have ""rough"" models in place by mid-November.  At that time I will look to bring a research person aboard.

Just an update, to keep everyone current on the progress of this initiative:

We (Matt (from Unify), Liz, Dave, and myself) met today and attempted to find ways to directly relate the Passport information (from El Paso) to the corresponding prices etc. in Unify.  Unfortunately, we discovered that there is no direct ""fool-proof"" way to accomplish this.  However, we have come up with a couple of things to try:

Liz is going to contact El Paso directly, and see if there is any other information they can provide in the Passport file that better uniquely identifies each deal / cut.  Hopefully, this will be something that makes relating the data to Unify much easier.
Matt is going to take a look at the format / content of the ""scheduled quantity"" file that comes in currently through the EDI Hub.  It's possible that this file contains cut information itself, which would possibly alleviate the need to use the Passport file altogether.

I believe that succinctly recaps the results of our meeting today.  If I have misrepresented anything, please let me know.  Also, feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.

Subject:	Competitive Analysis Update #26- US Response to Terrorism
Importance:	High


See below for update on situation in Afghanistan as well as fiscal stimulus plans in Congress.

RJ

1. 	The War on the Ground

For the most part, the military action in Afghanistan is likely to be the special forces ""inserted"" into Afghanistan to locate bin Laden. The special forces are doing very little in the way of fighting and will instead use the collected intelligence from various sources to ""snatch"" bin Laden and others, or to find other targets, identify them, and then call in attack aircraft.  Such attacks are by now well-priced in and would appear to be unlikely to have a disruptive impact on financial or energy markets.

Over the weekend, the press picked up on our reports from last week that currently the US has Delta Force, Green Beret, and Army Ranger units on the ground and some special operation forces ""in-country.""  Also,  British Special Air Service units, the French Regiment de Parachutistes d'Infanterie de Marine, and the German elite KSK special forces will be playing a role. Advance groups of the US 101st and 82nd airborne divisions arrived nearly a week ago at the Pakistani military base of Dar Esmail Khan, which is just west of the Suleyman mountains near Khojastan, a pass into Afghanistan and to Kandahar. Allied ground troops, backed by helicopter gunships and armored AC-130 armored planes have been stationed at former Soviet military airbases near Tashkent in Uzbekistan. 

The ground forces are backed by a massive concentration of allied airpower, ranging from nearly 150 US Air Force B-1 and B-52 bombers and F-16s and F-14s, as well as the nearly 400 aircraft in the four battle carrier groups the US Navy has moved into nearby waters led by the USS Enterprise, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, the USS Carl Vinson, and the USS Kitty Hawk. In addition the British have some 20,000 troops in Oman and a Royal Navy squadron around the HMS Invincible.

Allied air power and close ground support gunships are expected to provide air support to any coordinated attacks by the loosely aligned Northern Alliance, the main Afghan opposition to the Taliban.  

Due to the recognition of the difficult internal political situation in Pakistan, the US and allied presence is being kept to a very low profile and the actual contribution of Pakistani military forces is being kept to a minimum.  Yet it is the Pakistanis who will play a decisive role using their intelligence network in Afghanistan to find bin Laden.

2.	Fiscal Stimulus Outlook
By the end of October Congress will have passed a new package of stimulus measures totaling somewhere between $100 and $180 billion, if you count the $55 billion in airplane and reconstruction/defense spending already passed. 
Most officials with a dog in this hunt agree that tax-cutting gets preference over spending, but that there will have to be some direct spending to anesthetize the center-left crowd in the Senate and in the House where nerves are beginning to go raw over corporate ""bailouts"" that have not yet included anything directly for the employees. So for now, here is a brief list of the major policy options with equally brief commentary about their prospects:
?	Payroll tax cut/suspension -- This has emerged as the most likely item to be on any final list agreed to. As a stimulus item the economics are probably better on this than almost anything else, since it puts money directly in the pockets of workers who earn too little to pay income taxes and it can be implemented very quickly. Although it could add up to a very big number if suspended ($700 bn per year), because this is the money that goes into Social Security political leaders of both parties know they have to be careful about how the accounting and packaging get done on this. Still, both the White House and congressional Dems are big on this. Some version is likely to pass and the totals are likely to be somewhere around $30 bn. 
?	Accelerate the Bush tax cut -- If the original Bush tax cut was the right medicine, then why not have some more? The thinking here is that you have already agreed to do these things, and you no longer are watching the budget flip from black to red, why not put more money in the hands of those who pay the most taxes? The White House has been putting this idea forward, but not too aggressively, and the Democrats on the Hill have made it clear that they want the next tranche of tax relief to go to someone other than ""the rich."" Chances low, but if there is a broad package, this could get in. 
?	Capital gains tax cut -- This came on fast and has essentially died. It is too offensive and too obviously lacking in any stimulative qualities for anyone outside of senior House Republicans to like. Take this one off your list. 
?	Unemployment insurance and health care extension plus worker retraining programs -- These are very big among Democrats and the White House is sympathetic, but House Republican leaders are deeply split on this topic. There are some obviously restorative qualities to spending money this way, but the totals being batted around (over $30 billion for the retraining and health care components alone) send the Texas components of House leaders into shock, complaining of socialism. Democrats argue that Speaker Hastert promised them support for some serious version of these programs in return for bailing out the airlines without clogging the debate with ""airline worker assistance"" packages (worth about $4 billion). Hastert is saying he will still try to deliver, but his second and third in command are leading an in-house rebellion. 
?	Cut in corporate taxes -- A permanent cut in corporate taxes would be virtually impossible to wrangle through, but a temporary corporate tax cut is something that both Treasury Department and White House officials want to achieve. This is obviously something Democrats will not be happy about, but if they get the payroll tax relief and substantial amounts of their worker assistance package, they have to swallow hard for something. This was an early favorite of the administration's. As with most of the proposals that seemed so promising when they were first announced, this one has been running into some tough reality. There are a few problems with lower marginal corporate tax rates that have emerged. For one, many large corporations pay on something the IRS likes to call the AMT schedule (that's the Alternative Minimum Tax), so they would get no break at all. Even more disturbing is that companies with large tax-loss carryforwards sitting on the books as assets would take a massive hit on the value of these assets, since the calculated benefit they bring is adjusted downward all at once. For some weakened companies this alone could be fatal, since their attractiveness to acquirers depends on their loss-carry forwards. Finally, many employee expenses that companies can still get are deducted at their full marginal tax rate and the value of those deductions would obviously drop. 
?	Investment Tax Credit And Accelerated Depreciation Schedules -- The vast assortment of cuts that could come under this rubric are all plagued by the same problem: just talking about them gives businesses another reason to delay making investments. Even if the administration were to announce that all of these breaks will be given retroactively once legislation is passed, investments would be delayed since the fine print on what qualifies and on which schedule would mean huge differences in tax exposure. There is no way to propose these without delaying investment. On the plus side, the accelerated depreciation is simpler to describe in legislation, and can be done for a limited period without the same degree of distortion as the full ITC. Also, given the speed at which the stimulus debate is going forward, there may be less concern about the investment postponement issue. This item is likely in some form to make it into a final package, but the details don't exist yet, and its in the details that the significance of it lies. 
?	Specific sectoral tax breaks -- From the steel industry to the restaurant and hotel industry, every trade association has a specific tax break in mind that would help them recover. This is going to be the hardest to handicap since many of the small deals will be shoved in at the last minute on personal orders from members and they will not be big enough individually to make a macro difference. Cumulatively, though, these could easily top $10 billion before the special pleading is done.  Programs like high-speed rail, additional defense money, additional unemployment insurance for hard hit sectors could be shoved into this catch-all rubric. Some of these will make the cut others will not, but they can add up fast. 
?	Fast Track Trade Authority -- USTR Bob Zoellick told congressional leaders that if we had any chance to win the war against terrorism, the President would have to have full and complete fast track authority to cut trade deals as necessary. But Zoellick found himself apologizing to enraged Democrats for implying that a vote against fast track was a vote for terrorism. If he can recover from the politics of that maneuver, this one actually has some logic behind it as a diplomatic and economic response -- and it doesn't cost anything.

We will be following this for you with increasingly close focus this week since the real decisions will start to get made later this week and early in the next. Again, with an end-October deadline, there isn't a lot of time to waste and members of Congress are well aware of that fact.

I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.

The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:

	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg

	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.

	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock

I met with Settlements on Friday, and we were relatively close for the August invoice.  The Redwood Gas is an outstanding issue for us and Palo Alto.  When we finished on Friday we left a few action items, but my take on the meeting was that we have the deal in the system in a manner that will flow to the back office groups relatively smoothly.  
 
I will keep you posted.

Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads


I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

We do not agree with this short pay and stand by the description of the Socal product in which it states that there will be cuts due to operational constraints on the upstream pipelines.  I would like to return the short pay favor to Texaco.  Please let me know how we should proceed.

Subject:	Socal Window Meeting

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.


OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Figured I'd send you some of my propaganda.


One thing that you didn't point out:  The ""repeat blowouts"" of 1973 and 1987 occurred precisely 14 years apart.  This year, of course, falls exactly 14 years from 1987.

I like the way this is shaping up.

>>> "" ksw"" <kswalker@sbcglobal.net> 10/03/01 02:56PM >>>
Since 1950 (which all Sooners know is the true beginning of college football) OU has blown-out Texas by 27 or more points 7 times.  The years were; 1952, 1956, 1972, 1973, 1986, 1987, and 2000.  

The Sooners record in the year following said blow-outs is 6-0, soon to be 7-0.  Not to mention that OU repeated the blowout twice in the years 1973 and 1987.

Subsequent year scores:
1953: OU 19 Texas 14
1957: OU 21 Texas   7
1973: OU 52 Texas 13
1974: OU 16 Texas 13
1987: OU 44 Texas   9
1988: OU 28 Texas 13
2001: OU  ?  Texas  ?

If they were trying to meet quota by terminating Elizabeth, then I think they need to look elsewhere.

i just wanted to let you know that i am not considering moving to the denver office.  i don't see myself in a marketing role at this point in my career.  although this year has been up and down, i am enjoying my role on the desk.  i think the opportunity that you have given me as a basis trader is too good to give up.  the denver opportunity was just under consideration as an opportuinity to move back to denver.  we can talk more about it if you would like on monday.

If we all did this our problem would be solved.    Walt  

The message below was sent to an old AF buddy who forwarded it on to me with
the invitation to disseminate as widely as he saw fit. I send it on to you
with the same invitation... It offers some pretty good ideas.. 
********************************************************** 
My name is John Burnett. I am a DC-10 Captain for FedEx. I am also a Police
Officer for the Memphis Police Department. 

My purpose in writing this is to share some of my thoughts regarding actions
a pilot might consider when faced with a modern-day hijacker. These thoughts
are ""outside-the-box"" when it comes to the way we've all been trained.
Neither the FAA or our companies will suggest these techniques or implement
them as a part of our normal training cycles. They couldn't for fear of
lawsuits. 

I am distributing this via e-mail to buddies I've flown with. I'm asking
them to send it to their circle of friends within the industry, and for you
to send it to yours. I know most of us have e-mail, and I hope this reaches
the next to face the horror of some religious fanatic onboard. 

We have all had ""training"" in what to do in case of a hijacking; try to keep
the hijacker calm, make him think you're doing what he wants, take him where
ever he wants to go, etc., etc., etc. Save your passengers, your crew, and
your aircraft. 

In an emergency, you will revert to that training. When our unfortunate
peers were faced with the screams of the Flight Attendants and hijacker's
demands to open the cockpit door, their training probably made them open the
door. When the fanatics made demands, their training told them to comply as
best they could. I can only wonder what their thoughts were as they left the
cockpit and were tied up in the back of the plane; what they thought as they
descended over New York.... 

I hope the fanatics had to kill them in their seats and drag their dead
bodies out of the cockpit. But, I bet they did as they were trained to do ..

As you look back over recent hijackings, FedEx, and Egypt Air, and now the
September 11th hijackings, you see a perpetrator who, for one reason or
another wants to take over the airplane and kill himself. Each of these
hijackers, except for the FedEx incident, were successful. They took over
the airplane and killed everyone onboard. 

If you're following the news programs today, you hear a lot about how we
could let these hijackers learn to fly. You would think if knowing how to
fly would guarantee a successful hijacking, Auburn Calloway (the FedEx
hijacker) would have been a hijacker success story. 

Calloway had been a Navy pilot, a martial arts student, a fellow FedEx crew
member, and he took all the weapons he needed: hammers, knives and a spear
gun. He didn't have to overcome any Flight Attendants or demand they open
the cockpit door. He just went back to his bag, took out his hammer came
back into the cockpit and started crushing skulls. 

The crew members on that flight didn't worry about Flight Attendants, they
didn't worry about passengers. All three pilots left the cockpit and fought
a hand-to-hand, life-or-death battle. 

To survive today's hijacker, you cannot worry about your passengers; you
cannot worry about your Flight Attendants. You must develop a mind-set that
everyone onboard - including yourself - is already dead. Because, if the
hijacker is successful in taking over your airplane, not only you, your
crew, your passengers and your aircraft are lost, but thousands on the
ground are at risk. 

One of the reasons the FedEx crew survived, is the extraordinary actions of
the co-pilot. Although he had brain injury, the co-pilot took the DC-10 and
immediately executed a half-roll. This maneuver took the hijacker off his
feet as the Captain and S/O were struggling with him. 

During a point in the maneuver, the hijacker, Captain and S/O were thrown
back behind the cockpit door. When he righted the airplane, the F/O then
left his seat and joined the fight in the galley area of the plane. It was
only after the Captain determined the hijacker was subdued, he returned to
the cockpit and flew the airplane to landing. 

Very few of us have had to confront true evil. Fewer still have seriously
considered taking the life of another human being. I believe this is the
reason the FedEx crew did not kill their attacker. The crew's heroism that
day is beyond belief. And any action that leads to a safe landing and
recovery cannot be argued with. 

But, when the Captain left the F/O and S/O, thinking the situation was under
control, he was mistaken. The F/O and S/O had sustained serious,
life-threatening injuries. The hijacker had not. As the Captain flew the
aircraft, the hijacker, who had surrendered, began the fight anew. 

As the airplane landed, the hijacker was just moments away from overcoming
the two crew members. 

I mention this for your consideration. I would suggest that you make a
conscious decision to kill anyone who tries to take your airplane from you.

Today we are at war. The hijacker who comes through your cockpit door is
going to kill you and everyone onboard. So, how do you do that? What weapons
are available to us as pilots? 

The intercom. Command that all men come forward and fight with the
hijackers. You have many able-bodied men onboard. They are sitting in shock
not knowing what to do. Command that they come forward and help you kill
your attackers. And, they will come. 

The airplane itself. Get the hijackers off their feet. Go into an immediate
dive to float them to the ceiling. Then execute a 6G positive maneuver and
hope they hit their head or break their back as they hit the floor, galley
shelf, etc. 

Pull the fire handles, shut the start levers and turn the fuel valves off.
If you lose the battle, at least the airplane won't be used as a guided
missile on a kamikaze mission. With luck, maybe these guys didn't learn how
to do an in-flight restart. Then leave the cockpit - all of you, and kill
your attackers - don't believe it when they surrender - don't be nice to
them - KILL THEM. 

Flare Gun If your airplane has one, the Captain might consider making sure
it's loaded and secured next to his bag. I can think of nothing more
satisfying than watching a ball of burning phosphorous embedded into a
fanatic's gut. 

The crash-axe. I would suggest you have your co-pilot take it from it's
holder and secure it next to him so he has it immediately available. Makes
an excellent skull crusher. 

Your flashlight. The FAA use to require a 2 cell. A 3 cell Mag-Light makes
an excellent weapon. If your maneuvers have the hijackers on the floor
writhing in pain, crush their skulls. 

Your stolen hotel bic pen. Drive it into an attacker's eye, ear, throat, or
into the area just under the jaw bone. That's a particular interesting place
to drive it, because when he opens his mouth to scream, you can read ""Hyatt""
sticking there. 

Your hand and fingers Drive your fingers into his eyes and try to feel your
fingernails scrape the back of his eye sockets. Scoop the eyeballs out. It
will confuse the hell out of him when he finds himself looking at his shoes
as they dangle there on the ocular nerves. 

Your teeth. Remember Hannibal Lecter. Eat a nose, a cheek, or a finger. And
keep eating. Attack with all viciousness. A piranha is a small fish, but
it's greatly feared. A hijacker is not expecting you to eat him and it might
make him forget why he got on your airplane to begin with. It will, at
least, impress his buddies. 

Now here's my wish-list of things the FAA could do to help, especially in
this time of war. 

Arm the Captain 
The battle is not going to require any long shots. A small revolver would be
a good choice. It would hold off the attackers long enough for you to
disable your aircraft. 

If the attackers claimed the red package they were holding was a bomb, I'd
shoot out the door glass and hope the door would be ripped out and the
hijacker and his package would be sucked out. And hey, I if I got sucked out
with him, I'd try to fly my body to the hijacker look in his face and laugh
at him all the way to the ground. 

Invite The Police To Man The Jump Seat
Police are always looking for something free. Donut shops use to be a
favorite target for robbers - until they started giving donuts to the
Police. Robbers don't rob donut shops anymore. I would suggest each Police
Department send the FAA a list of the best shots on the department and those
guys and their guns would be welcome on my airplane. 

Fill every vacant seat with armed Police - give them a donut - and tell them
to shoot anyone who gives your Flight Attendant any shit. 

Stop this silly no-knife rule. Make it public. Tell the public they're
welcome to bring their pocket knives onboard. Then everyone will bring them.

So when you make your Intercom call to the passengers for help, you'll have
a dozen or more knife wielding helpers trying to make sure their new Gerber
tastes fanatics blood. There are even a few of them who'd want to keep the
fanatics ears as souvenirs. 

None of us is immune. Take some time and consider your actions if this event
should ever happen to you. My prayer is none of you ever have to face this
kind of decision. 

Best of luck to you, and may God Bless.

In this case, the ""club"" is Reliant, Williams, Duke and others who own TW transport to SJ from Ignacio.  Our TW transport expires in Dec, so for Enron to bid firm 100% flow in the SJ, we have to price it at a discount because of the cuts through Bondad on El Paso.  We could bid higher if it was average flows or we had TW firm transport.

Importance:	High


Linda,

After our conversation yesterday, I spoke with Tad Herz of Cordillera.  According to Tad, Cordillera has received bids from some ""small niche"" marketers for their San Juan production that were very attractive.  Per Tad, these local marketers enjoy some market advantage that allows them to overcome the large discount ($0.15) that Enron sees at the tailgate of the Ignacio Plant.  Tad referred to these marketers as a ""club"".  Therefore, Cordillera is not interested in Enron purchasing its San Juan production.  

Tad has requested that Enron modify/limit its proposal to just the Mid-Continent gas.  Contrary to Tad's comments on Tuesday, Tad stated yesterday that our Mid-Continent bid was competitive and Enron was definitely in the running for the Mid-Continent gas.  On Tuesday, Tad said Enron's Mid-Continent price was a little low.  For what its worth, Tad stated that Cordillera's target area to grow its production is the Mid-Continent area.   

Per our conversation, you said that the only way to improve Enron's Mid-Continent bid was to look at trying to sell the gas in the Mid-Continent area to some outside company.  Is this practical for the small volume that Cordillera controls?  Should Enron even look at selling wellhead gas to companies outside of Enron?  It appears that Enron may not be able to improve its proposal.

Linda,  I told Tad that we would target Friday to get a revised proposal to him.  We could have more time if we need it.  


Let's discuss this matter.

Kevin

Subject:	Booking New Deals

Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we found last week.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.

The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.

 << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >> 

The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:

1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;
2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;
3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk. 

Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

I will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesday morning.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Dear Curtis, 

Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
enough 
to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
school at 
the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
My 
concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
Energy 
industry, either as a trader or broker.  

As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be

looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
figured 
that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
to help 
me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
be able 
to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  

I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
hire.  
If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
will be 
in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
for our 
school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
a 
beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely, 

Mike Cook

I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues.... 

Pls advise. 

BT

Hi Mike,

I will be out this week, but just wanted to recap what
I spoke to you about earlier last week.  Mike Pena with Unify,
along with Chris Hyde and Dave Dronet in the Fundies group are looking into
connecting the Unify database with the cuts information in Passport this week.
When I come back I will let you know what they have done and help them on the commercial side with El Paso.

If you have any suggestions while this is in progress, please contact
myself or Chris Hyde.

Thank you.

-Liz.

Subject:	Wednesday's P/L

Mike:  Everything in the P/L looks good to me.  I have attached the cover sheet and the reconciliation.  The estimate was off on the gas daily curve shift because Monte Lost connection to Randy's files. This meant that on the estimate, the liquidated day was incorrect.  When I run it, we are much closer (within $20,000), but this is not the # you went home with.  This issue will be resolved tomorrow ensuring that the estimate will be more accurate.  

The next largest item on the reconciliation is the transport model.  There is not one deal that stands out as the culprit.  I need to do some more investigating as to how to improve the transport model estimate.  It may be discounting.  The curves and the spreads are all accurate.


The status of the three items we discussed today are: 

1. I am working away at the new deal model.  Kieth and I are in agreement as to the basic form.
2. I gave you the broker report.; and
3.  Jeff is working with confirmations to get you both the broker confirms and our confirms so that you can sign off on them.
3a. I am also working on the desk to desk physical report.  I was unable to run the report I initially had in mind.  I will let you know.

I am trying very hard to provide the information you need in a timely accurate fashion.  If you have any suggestions as to how Monte and I can improve, please tell me.

See you tomorrow.

Anne

Enron Falls Amid Concern Debt Threatens Dynegy Bid (Update2)
By Stacie Babula 
Houston, Nov. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. shares and bonds dropped after the energy trader disclosed debts of $9.15 billion due by 2003, suggesting a takeover by Dynegy Inc. may not happen soon enough to save the company from bankruptcy. 
Shares of Enron fell $1.17, or 13 percent, to $7.89 in late morning trading. Enron's 6.4 percent notes due in July 2006 were bid at 77 cents on $1 of face value and offered at 81 cents, down more than 3 percent from yesterday, traders said. 
Enron, whose shares plunged 90 percent this year as accounting errors led to earnings restatements, a federal investigation and a management shakeup, said it has less than $2 billion in cash or credit lines. Dynegy plans to complete its buyout by October, and Enron may have to ask its lenders to restructure payment schedules to survive. 
``This filing shows that Enron is in a precarious financial situation,'' said Commerzbank Securities analyst Andre Meade, who rates Enron shares `hold' and doesn't own them. ``They have to stay afloat for the Dynegy deal to go through, and that now looks difficult.'' 
Dynegy agreed Nov. 9 to buy Enron in a transaction now valued at $25 billion in stock and assumed debt. The difference between Dynegy's offer for Enron and the price of Enron shares widened to more than 45 percent from 29 percent yesterday, Bloomberg data show. 
``It's become more clear that the chances of this deal going through aren't 90 percent, but much closer to fifty-fifty,'' said Edward Paik, who helps manage the Liberty Utilities Fund, with 1.6 million Enron shares. ``There's just so much information that is unknowable'' about Enron's financial position, he said. 
SEC Filing 
Last week, Enron Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley said the company has $8 billion invested in ``non-core'' businesses, including broadband and the Dabhol power plant in India. Whalley said Enron will sell those business to pay down debt. Enron expects to get ``billions'' from the sales, Whalley said, without being more specific. 
Enron wouldn't comment on whether it could sell assets fast enough to keep current on its debts. Asset sales valued at about $800 million are expected close by the end of this year, the company said yesterday in its third-quarter filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission. 
Most of the $9.15 billion in debt is due before the end of the third quarter, when the Dynegy buyout is scheduled to close, according to the SEC filing. 
Dynegy and ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26 percent of Dynegy, may have to help Enron win refinancing agreements with its lenders, said Kathleen Vuchetich, who helps manage the $1.4 billion Strong American Utilities Fund, which is 5 percent Dynegy shares. 
``I never dreamt (the $9.15 billion in debt due) would be that large, coming due all at once,'' Vuchetich said. ``It calls into question their decision to schedule it that way in the first place.'' 
Enron yesterday reduced third-quarter results by 3 cents a share, bringing the period's loss to 87 cents, or $664 million, according to the SEC filing. On Nov. 8, Enron lowered earnings back to 1997 by $586 million to reflect losses by affiliated partnerships that were wrongly kept off the books. That included a third-quarter reduction of $17 million. 
A drop in Enron's senior unsecured debt rating to ``BBB-'' by Standard & Poor's on Nov. 12 may force Enron to pay off a $690 million note by Nov. 27 if it doesn't find collateral to guarantee the debt taken on by an affiliated partnership, the company said in the filing. 
Without repayment or collateral, investors in a partnership that owns Brazilian natural-gas assets can begin to liquidate the partnership's assets, Enron said. The company said it's working with lenders to come up with an acceptable agreement on the debt. 
Enron used affiliated partnerships to raise money quickly and take debt off its books. Its shares plunged this year as investors questioned whether the partnerships also were being used to hide losses from failed investments. 
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said last month that buying back 62 million shares from two such partnerships cost Enron shareholders $1.2 billion in lost equity. 
Fourth Quarter 
Making good on debt owed by its Whitewing affiliated partnership may cut Enron's fourth-quarter earnings, Enron said. Enron is obligated to back Whitewing by issuing junior convertible preferred stock. Because Enron's stock has plunged, it may have to write down its assets by $700 million, the filing said. 
ChevronTexaco, the second-largest U.S. oil company, is providing $2.5 billion in cash as part of the Enron buyout. It provided the first $1.5 billion a week ago. 
Shares of ChevronTexaco, based in San Francisco, rose $2.51 to $84.42 in midmorning trading. Dynegy fell 50 cents to $43.05. Dynegy and Enron are both based in Houston. 
Enron's Lay admitted last week that failed investments and a loss of investor confidence forced the sale to Dynegy. Before the buyout was announced, Enron stock had fallen 90 percent this year.

Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks,

Jeff

Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

1.	Afghanistan Ground War Set to Escalate

With a target list thinner than for Kosovo, results from the Afghanistan air campaign five days on have been limited.   But with Taleban fixed defences now softened up, the next phase of search and destroy ground raids, carried out by US and UK special forces and light assault forces, could be imminent.   Insertion will be difficult but various sightings made in recent days suggest to us that the process may have begun.   All our indications are that the US will commit a light division (up to 10,000 troops) and the UK a brigade (about 3,500).   This is a bigger commitment than previously advertised.  More stories along this line may become public over the weekend, even if the Pentagon does not explicitly confirm the action.

Word from Kabul is that Taleban morale is still high and that nightly bombings have prompted some commanders in the Northern Alliance to switch sides, joining the Taleban against the foreign invader.   But outlying Taleban commanders have defected the other way.   There is no clear pattern yet to these changes of allegiance and they may cancel each other out.  And as long as the air strikes remain accurate and clearly targeted against Taleban and bin Laden objectives - which they have been so far - the potential for the Taleban to rally more popular support in Afghanistan seems limited.

When the ground assault starts, from three or four strong points inside Afghanistan, the immediate aim will be to flush out Taleban forces and get them moving so they can be struck from the air.   Such action will be fast and high risk, without much media coverage (with the attendant risk that public support in the US diminishes if the real action is unseen).   If the Taleban can be thus loosened, special forces will then look for Afghans who can take them to the inner core of the Al Qaeda, led by bin Laden and Aymar al Zarawahi.  Depending on how long this takes, there is hope among allied planners that ""reasonable elements"" in the Taleban regime can be detached to form part of a broad-based coalition to run Afghanistan under supervision.   The Northern Alliance on its own is definitely not the answer.

2.	Saudis Feeling Increased Pressure

Refusal by Crown Prince Abdullah to allow Tony Blair to visit Saudi was only one manifestation of current nervousness in the Kingdom.   The tally of small, isolated violent incidents and attacks on Westerners in the interior is beginning to mount.   We have specific information moreover that leading Saudis who have not in the past paid money into Al Qaeda's coffers are now being 'advised' to do so, on grounds that they will not wish to incur Osama bin Laden's future displeasure.

Washington and London say the motivation for Abdullah's decision was well understood but both believe it was a mistake.  The points which Blair would have raised in public have been made by the British Ambassador in Riyadh to his Saudi hosts privately but it was the symbolism of the Prime Minister meeting with the King and the Crown Prince which London and Washington wanted to see.   Blair was particularly galled by Abdullah's blunt refusal to accept the visit when the two men spoke on the phone, particularly as it was the one blot on his most recent schedule of achievement.

3.	Pakistan Holding Steady- For Now

Popular unrest in Pakistan is real but amplified by media coverage.   Even in Peshawar we are told that 'playing to the cameras' has become a distinct element of the protest.   Musharraf meanwhile, having reshuffled top military and intelligence appointees, maintains both his grip and a wary eye on any signs of a split within his own ranks.  Our assessment is that he is controlling the situation - just.

4.	Key Issue for U.S. and Arab allies- Wider War?

There is also a distinct sense in Washington that major decisions are approaching.   This is not just the imminence of ground troops being deployed in Afghanistan, but the much wider question of the stability of Pakistan, the Gulf including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Turkey being put in some jeopardy.   Those who have thought through these issues say they are prepared to risk it.   As long as action against terrorism concentrates on Afghanistan, the leaderships of most of these countries believe the situation will remain manageable.   But if it were to spill over, there could be difficulties for these regimes.

I didn't know you were going to be out today or I would have talked to you earlier.  We had to take some large PMA expenses today that had been sitting around for a few months.  They totaled up to about $7mil.  I did talk to Phillip about this so he knows it is coming.  

Sorry for the bad news.

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

Would it be possible to keep Liz in our weekend rotation for a while to help Shannon out? All of our new people are starting this week and next week but it takes a while to get them into the weekend rotation. Daniel will probably be ready to go into the rotation in about a month but until then Shannon would have to work every weekend until then. Let me know if that is something we can work out.

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of November, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's December 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.  And what a bidweek it was!

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the ""comments"" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Nov. 30.  PLEASE NOTE THAT EFFECTIVE DEC. 21, THE KDOOL@MH.COM
ADDRESS WILL TERMINATE AND ALL E-MAIL SENT TO IT WILL BE LOST.  PLEASE
CHANGE YOUR ADDRESS BOOKS TO Kelley_Doolan@platts.com.

December monthly prices will be published on Monday, Dec. 3

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.


Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Kelley Doolan, chief editor

Subject:	PGT Expansion 2003 - Info

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know.

Mike,

I think it's a great idea to have a couple of spots on the floor. I would like to have the spaces and let people rotate sitting up there during trading. I think Shannon would be up there most mornings but she will need a spot downstairs since she schedules as part of a team. With Ted leaving and new people working with Shannon, she will be spending a lot of her time training. As for the Rockies area, they are all enthusiastic about learning more and I would like them to be able to rotate sitting on the floor. Let me know if that sounds OK to you.

Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads


I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Reitmeyer's P&L was an issue with Logistics.  His transport tickets were not put in until 4:00 yesterday - too late to capture.  We will talk to Superty about this.  His P&L will be -610,000, a 1.3 million increase.

Subject:	APEA Gas Prepay Transaction 

I have gotten a call from Roger Mock, CEO of American Public Energy Agency, regarding a series of transactions.

In 1999 we (ENA through Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp.) entered into a 12-year prepay.  We got approximately $297MM in cash up front, with delivery obligations at various delivery points, including NNG-Demarc, Rockies, TW-SJ, NIT, Topock and Sumas over the life of the deal.  

Currently the end users are Clark Public Utility District (Washington State), City of Glendale (California), City of Pasadena Water and Power Department (California), and Sacramento Municipal Utility District (California).

It is my understanding that ENGMC is not currently in bankruptcy.

I am sending down to Mike's attention a CD with the project documents on it.  I apologize in advance for the absence of a table of contents, but I felt lucky just to get the information.  Teresa Bushman may have a hard copy of the documents.

Roger Mock said that on Saturday he received a call from Kevin Brady notifying APEA that deliveries on Northern were being cut.  The documentation allows for some delivery point flexibility, should alternative delivery points be better for us at this time.  The other parties to the APEA deal are anxious to work out alternatives, if possible. 

Roger can be reached at (800) 476-3749.

Please let me know if I can be of help.

Thanks.

Yes!

At the time of my last update I had access to the data but was unable to retrieve anything.
This was resolved last week Thursday.  I've put together a project plan and have estimated
dates for each task below.

1.  Identify curves and get your signoff for usability of the numbers (11/20).
2.  Merge curves together (11/21)
3.  Demo a simple spread cacluation off merged curves (11/21)
4.  Demo retrieval of curves for recent days (11/26)
5.  Perform all math needed.  (11/28)
6.  Output the results to HTML (12/5)
7.  Deploy (12/7)

Thanks, 
Kim

Subject:	Booking New Deals

Mike and Jeff:  I would like to review our existing new deal procedures, and outline the additions I have made to our process in light of the error we found last week.

I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the existing procedures used by Risk to check our new deal entry every night.  I agree that the process must be enhanced because it leaves some room for errors because each Risk person is responsible for checking his or her own inputs.  The existing procedures do not have a backstop in place for catching volumetric errors. We will have an additional ""check"" in place if the traders and the Risk group arrive at the same net new deals positions from independent sources.

The following spreadsheet describes our existing process.  The only addition to the procedures is the last section on Deal Entry.  That section describes the new standardized Notebook and the deals to be entered by Risk.

 << File: NewDeal Procudures.xls >> 

The new procedures that are being put into place include the following:

1. All traders will use a standardized notebook for writing up their financial trades;
2. The traders will no longer be entering their own financial deals;
3. The traders will keep an electronic record of the volumes traded through the broker market that will then be consolidated with the EOL trades done.  This net position should tie out to the net position entered into the system by Risk. 

Keith Holst has had a similar function in a model that he runs; However, we decided that not only is his model to elaborate and complicated to be disseminated to all of the traders, but also this section has not been working.  I am working with Keith to design a simple process that will serve our needs and can be easily adopted by all Traders and Book Administrators.

I will have the standardized notebooks ready for use by the traders on Tuesday morning.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.

Mike,

I would like to start asking your group for an estimate for their P&L's daily.  If our numbers come out over or under their tolerance we will call them before we sign off for the night so there are no surprises in the morning.  If you don't have a problem with this I would like to start this today.

"Deal booking - Checks and balances","I would like to set up a spreadsheet to enter each deal that I transact, internal and external.  I would then like columns set up that allow Monte to enter post ids for all hedge strips for prior day and new day.  We should then sum the net change of the two and balance against the columns summing the new deals that I enter each day. 
 
This method should give us another way of checking if all new deals are being booked properly.  Please meet with Keith Holst to discuss how to set up the sheet.  He has a similar process of checkking new deals.  Once this is set up, please have each bookrunner adopt the same prcatice with their trader.  
 
I would like Anne to be responsible for seeing that this new process is in place for next week's business.
 
I understand that the standard for most deals is 5000/d and that this can lead to booking 50000/d at this volume.  We need to have Anne set up a trader deal sheet that lists the volume and price in a clear and legible format for all bookrunners.

- Gas Daily this morning page 2 comments on potential shut in on Colorado Interstate Pipe due to too much water in the pipes.Finding out more about the volume, timing, likelihood etc.



Comments from SSMB E & P report.....

""LOWER NATURAL GAS PRICES LEAD TO ""MODERATION"" IN PRODUCTION

With the significant pull-back in natural gas prices, EOG Resources announced
that it has already scaled back drilling activities during the second-half of
this year and is also ""moderating"" production from existing wells, primarily in
West and South Texas where it has shorter-lived wells.  Production ""moderation""
of roughly 50 MMcf/d, or about 6.0% of the company's current total North
American natural gas production, commenced in September and is expected to
continue through at least November.  On the drilling side, the company is
currently operating 40 rigs versus a peak of 51 this past summer and expects to
end the year with around 35 rigs operating.  Nonetheless, the company is
maintaining its $800-900 million capital program for the full-year, although
actual spending is now expected to come in toward the lower end of this range.
Importantly, EOG management stated that prior to production ""moderation"" and
reduced drilling, the company was on course to achieve its previously stated
North American production growth target of 4.0%.  With regard to 2002,
management is still optimistic that it can achieve a 4.0% production growth
next year if composite spot natural gas prices average at our current forecast
of $2.25/MMBtu.""

Here is the variable cost sheet you had sent me a while back.  I linked all of the products to Reuters.  In order to get the product prices to update real time you need to have Reuters open on your computer.  Take a look at it and if you like it we can get it on the plasma.  Sorry this has taken so long, our Reuters people aren't exactly the quickest when it comes to adding products.  Anyway, let know.

Dear Curtis, 

Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
enough 
to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
school at 
the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
My 
concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
Energy 
industry, either as a trader or broker.  

As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be

looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
figured 
that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
to help 
me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
be able 
to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  

I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
hire.  
If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
will be 
in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
for our 
school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
a 
beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.

Sincerely,

Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions.

Since the IT guys want to wait for the new software to put your cost analysis on the plasma screens I am currently working on using Reuters so that we'll have something in the meantime.  I had to call Lori Hernandez, Reuters contact, and have her add some more products to Kobra.  As soon as she gets back to me I'll put that together and get it on the screens.  Let me know if you have other questions.

Subject: RE: Palo Alto historical loads


I will set up a meeting with settlements to make sure that everything looks good from their end, and to clarify the payments that are made.  I also need to meet with volume management to emphasize how the volumes should be allocated when the actuals arrive from the pipeline statements.  I think that Daniel has the scheduling issues under control.  Jason, Daniel, and I worked to get everything straight for September.  October will not be much different.  The only exception for October is that we do not have any third party gas coming from Enron, only BP.   This actually makes life easier. As soon as I meet with the 2 back offices groups, I will report what I learned.  Based on my meetings with settlements during July's process, I am confident that the deal is booked as well as the system can handle. However, checking and double checking the processes will not hurt.   
 
I will schedule something with you and Kim after my other meetings.  Hopefully next week.
 
Imbalances for Rockies and Citizens -  I will let you know.  
 
We just finished cleaning up the SOCAL imbalances.  We are clear through June as far as P/L is concerned.  I think Matt Smith was working on July.  We did have some old issues to clean up as the process was passed from Kim O. to Jane, but we have worked through the problems.
 
 
Thanks for the note on the group.  I am holding a learning lunch tomorrow.  I want to make sure that our processes are as tight as possible, especially since bid-week is coming up.  We have a good method for checking that all of the failed desk to desk deals are booked correctly, so it should go more smoothly.  It will still be slow.  Also, Randy Bhatia is working with EOL on resolving their logic issues.  We are working towards a solution that will get the deals booked automatically.   I will let you know the time line soon.
 
I have a question.  What does the ""Wood"" report mean ?  
 
See you.

Disregard attachments.  How does the system know not to pay Palo for the gas daily deal at malin?  You did this because gas daily will not show up as risk and Kim puts together a manual invoice and will not pay them for the third party supply?  I want this deal to flow in the event Kim decides to travel the world.
 
Please set up another meeting to discuss this deal.  i will never understand.  is it just me?
 
Also, i still need to clean up imbalance deals from July with citizens and in the rockies. 
 
By the way, you are doing a great job.  It seems like your group is getting their books run early. 
 
Also, have you ever talked to your group about secrecy and the fact that we never tell anyone in the market about P&L and/or positions.  Just a reminder.  You may want to talk to them about confidentiality.  You never know who has a roommate from college at El Paso or Dynegy.  Right?

Mike:  Am I supposed to do something with the attachments ?  They did not transfer through on the e-mail you forwarded.  Kim has never given me any additional information regarding the loads.  All we did on this deal recently was book the newest fixed price deal at Malin, and book the BP volumes (3rd party deals) that have been projected at Malin.

On the BP gas: ..... We book a deal in which ENA purchases gas from Palo Alto at Gas Daily flat.  Daniel Schedules the gas on the transport directly from BP.  We enter the purchase in our system to show that you have 1,500 mmbtu/day at Malin that must be put on the transport to City Gate.

We have not rebooked the origination.  I am still using the estimated burns that were given to me at the inception of the deal.

Let me know if this clears everything up.  

Thanks 

Anne

Mike:

	It seems to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:

		1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.

		2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the
		    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some 
		    sort of explanation.

	My preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.

	I trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.
