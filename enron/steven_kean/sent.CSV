Subject:	WTO Energy Services Coalition Lives!  (Sort of)

As you may know, Enron has ceased all funding of the efforst made by the Energy Services Coalition an entity that it was instrumental in establishing.  However, Linda recognised that we could not completely abandon our involvement with the ESC and the USTR effort to negotiate an energy services section of GATS.  Otherwise, Enron would risk damaging its reputation within USTR and among the other members of the coalition.  In fact, carol Ballassa of USTR spoke with me privately about her concern (and, alledegedly, Zoellick's concern) that Enron would abandon the effort. Therefore, Linda set me on the task to ""rationalize"" our ESC involvement.

Upon further scrutiny of the ESC effort, it became apparent that the GATS effort on energy services had absolutely nothing to do with deregulation or liberalisation of the energy sector.  In fact, mention of open access - particularly gas pipelines - caused some of the ESC members to break out into a cold sweat.  Unfortunately, few, if any, of the energy services that could be provided by Enron can be offered in a monopoly market.  Therefore, there was little for Enron to gain in these negotiations unless the deregulation was adressed as a prerequisite to opening trade in energy services.

I met privately with the USTR negotiating team and made the case that deregulation had to part of the negotiating agenda.  Otherwise, I told her that there would be little to gain for Enron and we would not be an active participant as a result.

We met today with USTR and other members of the coalition and in fact, deregulation was on the USTR negotiating agenda.  GE and Enron supported the way in which USTR would raise the issue in negotiations, but other members of the ESC (from the oil and gas sector) objected strenuosly to pipeline access provisions.  As it stands, the ESC will split or fold on this provision.  If the USTR agrees to water down its negotiating provision, they know that Enron will likely leave the ESC.  If the provision remains, then the USTR effort may actually prove beneficial to Enron in the long run. Regardless of the outcome, Enron's time and expenditure on this effort will be minimal to non-existant.

If you have any questions, please call.

Subject:	update

Three matters:

1.	Conference call with Staff.

Particpants were:  Phil Nyegaard (staff lead for the Enron/PGE merger and currently acting chief of staff); Bryan Conway (lead staff electric techie and staff on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Mark Helman (Staff lead on PGE's rate case and the lead on the Sierra/PGE transaction); Lee Sparling (a lead on a number of gas company cases); and Bonnie Tatum (lead staff gas techie).  The call went well.  Staff was upbeat, interested, but (of course) non-commital.  They asked a number of questions--none of them troubling.  

	Timing.  They asked when we wanted a OPUC order.  Sue Ackerman suggested 9 months.  Pamela Lesh suggested that we would push for a shorter time frame.  Helman replied that we may be able to get this transaction done quicker, but this transaction presented different issues than past cases.  Helman asked suggested that we may need to propose conditions limiting anti-competitive gas vs. electric practices.

	Financing.  Helman asked how NNG will finance the ($1.55 billion) cash portion of the purchse.   Ackerman responded that she would provide detail on the terms and conditions of the CSFB/Merrill financing.  

	Other Regulatory Review.  Helman asked whether the SEC would be reviewing the financial condition of the holding company.  We responded that the SEC would not be focusing on the financial condition of the holding company as it will be an exempt, intrastate.  I explained the other regulatory processes that would apply to the transaction.  Ackerman noted that the Washington Commission would review, but that we expected the issues to be limited.  

	Process.  Nyegaard noted that Mark D. and Peggy F. had met with the Commissioners.  He asked whether additional briefing would be necessary.  I responded that our discussions with the Commissioners had been brief and focused on the overall structure of the transaction and process.  I stated that we did not have any numbers at the time or other key details.  We said that we intended to seek a public meeting with the full commission (after our application is filed).  Staff supported a public meeting on the transaction.   They offered to join us in any future private meetings with the Commissioners (!!!!).  We said that we weren't planning any addition private meetings.  

2.	Other parties

	Sue Ackerman spoke with Bob Jenks of CUB yesterday.  Her call followed our unsuccessful attempt to reach him via conference call.  Jenks was interviewed by the Oregonian for today's article.  He questioned NNG's ability to finance the purchase of a larger company.  In his private discussion with Sue, Jenks repeated his concern with NNG's ability to finance the transaction.  The only other concern he raised was NNG's practice of bringing regulatory issues to the legislature.  

	We were unable to reach ICNU and NWIGU--but left messages with Ken Cannon and Paula Pyron--respectively.

3.	Rate Conditions.

	We're still working on a variety of proposals for a rate condition.  At this time we are considering a proposal that would mirror NNG's ROE earnings test.   Under this approach, PGE would:  (1) compare actual distribution system related earnings to authorized earnings; (2) create an account which would track the difference between actual and authorized; (3) share a certain portion of the difference between actual and authorized--above 300 basis points.  The sharing would not take place until the next filed rate case.

	Under this approach neither PGE nor NNG would commit to a rate freeze.  Parties could drag the utilities into the PUC through a show cause order--however, note that there have not been any show-cause rate cases at the OPUC in recent history.  Fuel savings (resulting from the merer of gas procurement activities) would flow through automatically to ratepayers through NNG's PGA and through PGE's PCA (of its progeny).  

	PGE is conducting an analysis of this mechanism to determine its impact on earnings.  We will discuss this mechanism with all of you before discussing it further with NNG.  

4.	FERC Review

	We're pushing PGE and NNG to complete the data collection effort for CRA's market power analysis.  A revised schedule for the FERC, SEC, OPUC and WUTC proceedings will be circulated by mid-week.

"RE: Draft Post-Labor Day Legislative Plan On RTOs","Paul Kaufman and I met earlier this week with Gov Geringer of Wyoming.  He is supportive of a single RTO though it is not clear that he favors a FERC mandate.  He will wlso be pulling together a small group of Western Govs to meet with Pat Wood to discuss the negative impacts of FERCs refund and rate cap proceedings on Western power markets outside of California.  He has asked us for two things (which I believe Paul, Sue L and Janel are working on):

Agenda and briefing paper we would propose for the Govs meeting with Wood
A ""white paper: describing the burdens placed on western markets as a result of the price cap and refund processes.

Like most Western govs, Geringer has little tolerance for federal mandates but he is very well informed on energy issues, favors open markets and is very interested particularly in seeing the western power grid opened.  Geringer will also be participating in Bingamin's ""panel"" on or about Oct 9.

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

I'm not sure of the context of your Email to Ken, but I wanted to emphasize one point on the data you've put together.   The Center for Responsible Politics' numbers include individual contributions.  Thus, if you look at Enron's so-called split, under their analysis Enron splits its $ much for favorably for Republicans than in the numbers underpinning the pie charts contained in the material I distributed.  Unlike the Center's numbers, my charts do not reflect giving by individuals working at Enron.  Most of our individual $, which is significant, is given to Republicans.  Consequently, as I understand the history of our giving, part of our thinking on splitting soft $ is to offset the overwhelming individual $ given to Republicans.   One last thought is that I understand the split recommended in our proposed budget  is much more Republican than it has been in past years.  Hope this helps.

Further to our conversation of the other day, we have compiled some information on political contributions by other corporations.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).  The interesting one is the financial sector, where contributions are more evenly split with one (Bank of America) heavily slanted to the Democrats.  Have a look and let's talk.

Good afternoon-

I have pulled the information that you requested and the attached document outlines the findings.  Per your request, the data compiled is a sampling of soft money donations for the 1998-2002 cycle for the Energy, Financial, and Pharmaceutical industries.  This was ready for you last night, but I decided to dig a little deeper and have provided additional data that you may find useful.

I looked at the specific industry for the companies that you requested and then I backed up to the ""Overview"" for the industry.

In ""The Center for Responsive Politics"" website, the ""Top Recipients"" are based on contributions from PACs, soft money donors, and individuals giving $200 or more. Due to the voluminous nature of the Top Recipients listed, I printed them out and they are available for your perusal.  On the spreadsheet, I continued the analysis on the Top Recipients and what was donated, in the election cycles 1998 - 2000, across the 3 industries.   Because you asked for a combination of Oil & Gas Companies and Electric Utilities, I showed Electric Utilities and Oil & Gas data, separately and then combined.  

Numbers that are listed in ""bold"" indicate the group who had the largest donations within each research area.  The split on the ""Top Presidential Democrat and Republican Candidates"" are calculated from the ""Overview of Sectors '98 - '00"".

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.

Sorry -- I was not cleaqr. I am after the company's value in the olden days

recollection is that something like $2 billion is the number, but I could be 
way off. What I am hoping to be able to say is that those investors who 
bought in at that long-ago time and stayed in have had their investment

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY EDITS TO THIS Email.  I want to send it to the DC staff.

Out of super super precaution, Enron security and others in Houston have recommended that personnel in the DC office be tested for Anthrax exposure.  They do not think there is a problem, but nonetheless recommended that we take this step.  I am awaiting word on where we should go for the test.  Also, please let Carolyn Cooney know if you have had any visitors to the DC office, who have been to Capitol Hill in the last three weeks. 

Again, this is strictly out of precaution, as we strongly believe there is NOT a problem.  In the meantime, while normal business will not be possible with Capitol Hill, let me encourage everyone to continue working on those internal projects we can get done and have been waiting for a quiet moment to do so.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Subject:	Dabhol Washington Update 


	Here is an update on the state of play in Washington regarding Dabhol as the Indian PM arrives this evening:

	As it became apparent last week that the discussions in Delhi about the MOU were not panning out, I met with OPIC President Watson and Exec VP Connelly to bring them up to speed on the status of discussions and map out the message to be given by the Administration to the PM on his visit this week.  While OPIC certainly does not have final say re the message on Dabhol they are clearly the driver within the USG and they have been very aggressive in that regard.  Out of our meeting Watson sent to State and the NSC a message with the following two points:
	1.  the Project sponsors, the $ lenders, and OPIC and EXIM are of one mind that the negotiating time frame on Dabhol is approaching its end.  If India does not act immediately it will be too late.
	2.  The President and this Administration needs to express its strong disappointment at the failure of the GOI to make an effort to engage on the Buyout, which needs to be negotiated within a particular $ range, subject to a simultaneous negotiation with the $ lenders.

	The OPIC memo was sent to State and the NSC and is now embodied in talking points for President Bush in his Friday meeting with the PM.  For the last week plus I have provided daily updates to OPIC, to Larson's office at State, to the South Asia regional group and to the NSC so they know of any new developments and where we are.  Yesterday afternoon I  met with OPIC on the lawsuit and how that might change the talking points.

	At this point, President Bush will raise Dabhol in his meeting with the PM Friday. The Indian Ambassador met with the NSC yesterday to discuss the agenda and was briefed on the MOU going in.
	It is being considered that Larry Lindsey will discuss Dabhol in greater detail, probably with Mishra.  There was some concern about prior relationship to Enron but I understand from State the lawyers have taken care of the concern.   
	Larson is in Doha but is current on the situation and can engage if necessary.  It is unfortunate he is out of town.
	Amb. Blackwill had dinner last night with Watson and Connelly of OPIC and claims he is on top of the issue.

	Last, but certainly not least, we have a meeting with the PMO Secretary Ghash (?) at 4:30 Thursday at the Indian Embassy.  I do not know if we have firmly decided yet who should attend.  If Jim is out as I understand he is perhaps Rob Walls and I can attend.  This meeting should give us an opportunity to respond in the Washington context to the proposal that I understand is in the offing in Singapore.  We will then be in a position to feed that information back into the USG so that the President's meeting with the PM reflects the current state of discussions.

Steve, here is the contact list that you requested.  By NO means is this a complete list, as I was not able to get hold of everyone in our group.  Christie will be back tomorrow and will add/delete/amend accordingly.  Mike will provide you with phone numbers for U of C, Northwestern, LSU, UT.
 
As an aside, I believe the general consensus from my counterparts is the most beneficial route to take would be to allow those who already have an existing personal relationship with key faculty and deans to be at the forefront of any contact and/or communications.  Enron's credibility has been very publicly damaged by a few of Enron's key executives and schools are reluctant to have discussions with someone from our camp whom they don't already know.
 
Hope this document helps in the interim.

Subject:	Text for Enron wide email

Steve - below are the initial measures we believe we can take starting Wednesday.  The problem is guard force manpower.  The increased demands are so great now that the current force is working two 12 hour shifts instead of three 8 hour shifts.  We will be putting in a request for more guards in the next couple of days, but it takes 3 weeks for them to be hired and trained by the contractor.

Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit.  Also - would you like the email to come from you, the Office of the Chairman, or business controls? 

Text of Message:

Due to recent events, Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world.  As part of this increased security effort, beginning Wednesday morning, September 26, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and, where applicable, at other Enron facilities:

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building, a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer.

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility.  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders.

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building (U.S. 	driver's	 license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card.  Visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, 	or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Building.

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a 	visitor's log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  	At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees.

Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic ""Save the Date"" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.

You are correct!  This is not a new issue, but it seems to resurface on a regular basis.  The issue has been pointed out regularly (the first time in connection with the license and regularly thereafter) and each time the business has said not to worry, if they can't cut a deal with New Power they will just pay the $1/MW.  EES has assumed it will pay the $1/MW since day one!

Harry and Gloria:

Jim Keller and I have indeed dealt with this issue in the past (it actually came up at the time we were applying for our TX marketer license). 

 It is my understanding, and Jim, please comment if my information is ""stale"", that we were going to choose the option set forth in Sec. 39.352(g)(3), which allows us to make a payment into the System Benefit Fund.  This approach was discussed with Dennis Benevides, and then, I believe, with Don Black, and they were OK with our pursuing this course, in lieu of having TNPC provide service to residentials on our behalf. 

 Please call me if you have any questions:  814-835-0793.

Ed,

Residential Obligation
Section 39.352(g) of Senate Bill 7 provides that for any REP serving an aggregate load in excess of 300 MW, 5% of the load must consist of residential customers. A REP can fulfil this requirement by:
1. Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to 5% of its total load
2. That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf, or
3. It pays 1 dollar per MWH of required 5% load into the System Benefit Fund.
 EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power to serve residential load on its behalf, or can pay the 1$ per MWH penalty.
There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate compliance if it has an agreement with New Power.

EES Contract,
For price to beat customers, the utilities have by Commission rule, the obligation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the 5 year period conmmencing 1/2/02. The Commission concern may be that Enron will abuse this provision by gaming the system. The Enron contracts as currently written are within the rules as approved by the Commission. Until the utilities move to amend the relevant rules, the Commission can only exercise its displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what conduct amounts to abuse and gaming. I think it will ultimately be a question of degree and pattern of switching. The onus will be on the affiliated REPs to prove abuse and gaming. Fundamentally, it is in the best interest of the market to allow customers to come and go. Customer mobility is the best customer protection in a competitive market. Besides, a restraint on customer mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase customer inertia. The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action to insure that they achieve a reasonable balance. For larger than 1MW customers, they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their ability to come and go.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Everyone -  

I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Energy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class/industrial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed (300 Mw of industrial rate class load).  

EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements.  Therefore, I cannot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement.  However, it is something we definitely need to look into.  In addition, we (EPMI/EWS) are getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they see the pilot and the market structure unfolding.  Specifically, they are not pleased with retail energy providers' contracts that contemplate the right to switch between direct access and tariff (and visa-versa).  We will monitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their displeasure.

On the residential requirement front, someone needs to address this.  Specifically, is this true.  If so, what rate classes are considered industrial vs. commercial?  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load?  Is TI considered industrial?  Do we already have industrial customers in our portfolio?  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter markets?

Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspective as they are focusing on more of the pure, large industrial customers.  We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group.

Steve/Rick,

To echo Greg, I am now here and this is one of the many items on my agenda. I have been wanting to build something like this for Enron for 2 years now. I'm a big believer that an Enron Portal will go a long way to helping Enron and its various business units consolidate its vast knowledge base to make information more readily availabe across all business units with the added benefit of reducing longer term development costs.

I've touched down in the mids't of budget season :-) , so give me a week or so and I'll come see you about this.

Steve and Rick:  You may have heard that EBS is winding down its business in the Asia Pacific region.  This is, of course, greatly disappointing for everyone involved but is the right thing to do given the status of the industry here.  We have a great team in the region and I am trying to help members of the team find new homes in Enron.  Along those lines, I wanted to bring Maurice Nunas to your attention.  Maurice joined EBS this past June and is Director of Government Affairs for the region.  We were fortunate to land Maurice from Motorola in Singapore.  Maurice is a recognized expert  on telecommunications regulations in Asia, and has excellent working relationships with a number of governmental bodies and NGOs across the region.  In a short period of time Maurice has made significant progress on a number of governmental and regulatory issues that were facing us in the region.  He has proven adept at picking up the fundamentals of the Enron business model and has skills that would transfer across a number of commodities.  Maurice is interested in staying with Enron and working in Houston, elsewhere in North America or in the Asia Pacific region -- since he is new to Enron and does not have extensive relationships around the organization I thought I would forward his cv to you as you are in a superior position to know what the various business units' needs may be.  Thanks for your consideration -- please feel free to forward Maurice's resume or to let me know what I can do to further his placement in Enron.  

I hope all is well with both of you.  Regards.

Steve -- For your approval.  As some additional information regarding the request, Kathy, Diane Taylor and I met with Deana Taylor this afternoon to understand what each person's role was and the specific access needed.  For the interim, we are recommending that the HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP and View Payroll and Time ENTP role be granted to each of the individuals listed below.  Until January 1, this function was performed in the Payroll Department and at that time was transitioned to Karen and Deana's group.  The people listed below actually transferred from the Payroll Department.  For the long term, we are going to look at creating a specific role for this group that would let them access only those data elements needed.

I've spoken with Mary Joyce by phone and she has approved, so I am requesting your approval as well.  These people have basically been prevented from being able to reconcile any of the net pay accounts, etc.  for the past week.

Please let me know if you will approve or if you need any additional information.

Jo Ann,
As we discussed I am sending this email to request PR2 Enterprise access re-activated for the following employees:
  
   Karen Choyce               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Deana Taylor                HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP
   Joanne Cortez              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP     (starting in the group 7/16)
   Rebecca Tran               HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   Roy Comeaux              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time
   George Howell              HR View Basic Data & Org ENTP   &   View Payroll and Time  

Please note I am not requesting access for the entire department,  the list of employees above are the only individuals in our group that will be allowed this type of access. Corp's payroll accounting group is responsible for reconciling the general ledger balance sheet accounts across all Enron companies, therefore Enterprise access is needed.

The requested access is essential for our group to perform our job.   Without this, we are unable to trace amounts related to FIT, FICA, net pay, stock option deductions, etc,  through the payroll system to the ledger, and to ensure that the items are accounted for properly.   Equally as important,  the access enables us to identify system issues between PR2 (payroll) and PR1 (ledger).   Corp's payroll accounting group has already identified several processing issues and alerted the ISC.   

I hope this ""pleads our case"" on why we need the access and request it be re-activated.    Please feel free to call me or Mark Lindsey, if you need additional information. 

Thanks,
Deana

Subject:	Pending Refund Order Discussed at Today's Commission Meeting

Although a final order is not yet available, we were able to glean the basic content of the Commission's latest refund order from the discussion had at the Commission meeting this morning.   It appears that the Commission has not strayed far from Judge Wagner's recommendations, which came out of the settlement conference ordered by FERC.  Highlights include:

In California, refunds/offsets apply only to spot transactions in CAISO and CalPX, and only as of October 2.

Both public and non-public utilities are subject to refund.

It appears that the refund methodology will be similar to that of the June 19 Order, as refined by Judge Wagner.

Daily spot gas prices will be utilized in the methodology.

A 10% creditworthiness premium will be added.

An evidentiary hearing will be ordered to collect the data needed for the methodology;  it is our understanding that the CAISO will have 15 days to provide certain information and the Judge must certify the record in 45 days.

A separate preliminary evidentiary hearing will be ordered to consider Pacific Northwest refunds.  It was briefly described as consisting of an information gathering proceeding of 15 days, followed by an evidentiary proceeding of 30 days.  The Judge would then have an additional 7 days to report to the Commission.  An issue will be the definition of ""spot"" transaction for the Pac NW, since counsel to the Commission noted that it could differ from the spot definition for California.


We are awaiting the final order and will update this report as soon as it issues.

Jackson says coalition wants role in energy deal 
By NELSON ANTOSH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Activist Jesse Jackson says the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition intends to be a part of the regulatory process leading to the closing of the Enron-Dynegy deal. 
The organization, which he founded, owns Enron stock and shares in several other large Houston-based energy firms. 
""Dynegy needs our participation to get approval,"" Jackson said Monday. 
The organization's interest in the acquisition of Enron by Dynegy is in assuring minority inclusion in any possible spinoffs, employment, contract commitments and EEOC rulings. 
Jackson is here for the first annual energy summit conducted by the Houston bureau of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project. The summit continues today in the Hyatt Regency downtown. 
Those companies played a role in this conference that suggests they are in touch with Jackson already. On Monday he praised Enron head Ken Lay's integrity although the Enron executive is on the other end of the political spectrum. 
Lay and Dynegy's chief executive officer, Chuck Watson, would have been at the group's energy summit if it weren't for the announcement last week that turned everything topsy-turvy, Jackson said. 
The coalition opened its Houston bureau in May on Smith Street so it can do research, go to annual meetings and distribute information, Jackson said. 
Protests and boycotts are not part of the plan, said William-Paul Thomas, the bureau chief here. 
The Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, which Jackson heads, has taken an interest in energy and Houston in particular, as demonstrated by his appearance at the Offshore Technology Conference here early this year. 
Blacks and Hispanics have been locked out of employment, upper-level management and contracts, Jackson said. 
Jackson lamented the lack of emphasis on energy security now that the nation's attention has turned to terrorists and anthrax. 
He also took the opportunity, in an interview, to criticize President Bush's plans for stimulating the economy from the top down, with a tax plan that will benefit large corporations to the tune of billions of dollars. 
""It must be bottom up,"" Jackson said. 
One-third of Rainbow/PUSH Coalition's idea for economic stimulation is travel vouchers, worth $1,000 each and good for up to six months. 
This would help employment in the hard-hit travel and vacation industries during the holiday season, he said.

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Steve and Rick:  You may have heard that EBS is winding down its business in the Asia Pacific region.  This is, of course, greatly disappointing for everyone involved but is the right thing to do given the status of the industry here.  We have a great team in the region and I am trying to help members of the team find new homes in Enron.  Along those lines, I wanted to bring Maurice Nunas to your attention.  Maurice joined EBS this past June and is Director of Government Affairs for the region.  We were fortunate to land Maurice from Motorola in Singapore.  Maurice is a recognized expert  on telecommunications regulations in Asia, and has excellent working relationships with a number of governmental bodies and NGOs across the region.  In a short period of time Maurice has made significant progress on a number of governmental and regulatory issues that were facing us in the region.  He has proven adept at picking up the fundamentals of the Enron business model and has skills that would transfer across a number of commodities.  Maurice is interested in staying with Enron and working in Houston, elsewhere in North America or in the Asia Pacific region -- since he is new to Enron and does not have extensive relationships around the organization I thought I would forward his cv to you as you are in a superior position to know what the various business units' needs may be.  Thanks for your consideration -- please feel free to forward Maurice's resume or to let me know what I can do to further his placement in Enron.  

I hope all is well with both of you.  Regards.

From: Steve [mailto:steve@telanetix.com]

Subject: Higher Education


Dear Steven Kean,
 
I am contacting you directly because you are the leader of Enron's educational initiatives.  I am hoping you will take a few minutes to allow me to introduce myself and my company.  I am sure you do not appreciate unsolicited mail, therefore, I apologize for this intrusion, but I believe I you will be interested in what I have to say. 
 
I am a founder in a fairly new company that is focused on a new technology for education.  We are building one-on-one relationships between major companies and universities.  We are not a distance learning company.  We do not provide content.  We simply provide a unique platform for people to communicate with each other over great distances, as though everyone involved were sitting in the same room.
 
My goal today is to provide you with information that could allow Enron to have direct links into university classrooms.  The possibilities include having Enron executives and managers attend a Stanford MBA program without having to travel to Palo Alto, or, attend a Harvard executive program, without having to leave the workplace.  Our plan is simple; Enron picks the school of its choice, we install digital classrooms at the school and at Enron.  Through the use of digital technology, these classrooms now become one.  Enron employees now attend the same class, in real time, that is being taught at a school or university.  The additional benefits to Enron are many; less time lost, all travel expenses saved, employee moral and retention, to name a few.  This also allows key executives to upgrade their skills that would normally not want to be away from their job and family.
 
My company, Telanetix, is building a network of ""virtual"" or digital? classrooms around the country to link major universities with major corporations.  Our digital classrooms"" are unlike anything you have seen.  They appear as well appointed lecture rooms, but the front and back walls are high resolution video screens. There are no visible cameras or microphones.  Everyone in each room sees everyone else, people are life-sized, there is no latency, sound is directional, no panning or zooming is used, etc.  The technology is transparent to the participants, and this allows them to concentrate on each other.  The impression of the participants is that they are all in one large room.  No training is required to use the room...all that is required is for the participants to enter the room and start talking.
 
The digital classrooms are so real in its effect that this technology is being readily accepted among elite school as a means for distant education.  All classes or programs are exactly the same as being taught on campus today.  Prospective students still apply to the college of choice and are admitted through the same process as students who plan to attend class on campus.  All programs will have the full acceptance and accreditation of the school where the classes originate.
 
When it is all said and done, Telanetix becomes invisible.  We simply link the likes of Stanford, Harvard and MIT directly into corporate training centers.  Enron employees would interact directly with the University, and pay their tuition to the University.  Telanetix collects its fees from the University and not the students.
 
This technology is up and operating.  Our partner TeleSuite (Dayton, Ohio) has established about 25 conference rooms around the country with companies such as IBM, 3COM, CIGNA, Price Waterhouse Coopers and AOL-Time Warner.  The University of Arizona and Duke University also have rooms.  The University of Arizona is using a prototype of a teaching room to conduct two Executive MBA programs in the Silicon Valley (3COM) from their Tucson campus.  Duke uses the technology to communicate on administrative issues with their campus in Frankfurt, Germany.  Telanetix anticipates installing classrooms at Stanford University and the University of Maryland in the near future.  Additionally, we are linking overseas sites to this network in England and Australia.
 
This technology is new and cutting-edge.  I hope Enron will consider joining the small, but growing list of companies that are bringing tier one education directly into the workplace.
 
In addition to using the digital classroom for higher education, all our business customers are using them for virtual conference rooms, usually between executives in different locations.  IBM, for example, has five of these rooms and is ordering five more because they have proven to be very cost effective as a means to reduce travel.  Why?  Because the conferencing is so profoundly real in its effect that the users feel as if they are all present in the same room.  This is not video-conferencing.  This is way beyond that.
 
As executive vice president and chief of staff for Enron, I sincerely appreciate your taking the time to read this.  I believe that we have a value proposition for Enron to consider.  I would very much like to demo our digital classroom to you and discuss the benefits and possibilities it might bring.  Below I have attached a few pictures of the digital classroom.
 
For more information, please visit our web site at www.telanetix.com <http://www.telanetix.com/> .
 
I look forward to your response.
 
Sincerely,

I have a couple of questions in relation to the content:

1.  Can we refer to Wessex Water on our list of non-core assets in Europe?

2.  Can we list the specific businesses under review as per the proposed draft below (which is not included in the attached draft?)

""The businesses currently under review in Europe are Global Markets (except Coal), Industrial Markets, Metals, Credit and the Wind Turbine manufacturing business.  Also under review is the E Power generation asset development business in Japan"".  Given that these businesses are being identified in the media I would assume that we can although note that they don't appear in your message point summary received last night.

A prompt response would be very much appreciated.  Thanks.

Some additional background on the California refund issue.  Consistent with what we discussed; just some additional detail.

Subject:	CA Refund Case Information; PRIVILEGED & CONFIDENTIAL

Steve,  

Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in, regarding the California refund case, and I passed the following along to him by phone:


Status of the refund claim:  

The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress, and the final claim at the FERC-ordered settlement conference, were approximately $38 MM.  The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar, although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us $1MM!  A review of their claim revealed errors.  I asked Charles River Associates to re-run the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a $57MM figure.  Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO.  However, I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time.  I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December 7, and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it.


Points summarizing the proceeding:

The California refund proceeding at FERC, unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding, contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds.
Issues to be decided by the Judge include (1) the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price (2) the amounts owed by each seller and (3) the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation.
This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISO's data.
Due to deficiencies in the data, it is also difficult to assess potential exposure. The California ISO's claims have thus far been erroneous.
Hearings are scheduled to occur on December 17-21 and February 11-15. The Judge's ruling is expected on March 8, 2002. 

Timing of the FERC Order:
It is difficult to say how quickly the Commission may rule after receiving the Judge's certification of findings and record on March 8.  Arguably, they could act very quickly due to the limited scope of the proceeding and the fact that the Judge's findings will likely be limited to the three issues described above.

Let me know if you need any more information.  I will copy you on significant memos in the case.  Regards,  Ray

I think it makes sense to send somebody from Enron to make a presentation,

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-

"","Some background information for the meeting with Mayor Brown:

Brown won 43% of the vote (to Sanchez' 40%) and is now in a run off with Sanchez.  Sue Walden's perspective, not surprisingly, is that Brown will win and that campaign polls show him ahead among likely voters.  African American turnout in the election was lower than expected, but an active get-out-the-vote campaign could turn that around.
Enron has supported the mayor with a $10,000 contribution.  I would not recommend a further commitment under the current circumstances.
If you want to discuss some of the positive accomplishments of his administration, you could:
Congratulate him on passage of his version of the light rail proposition.
Compliment him on how he has responded to security issues since Sept 11 and his handling of flood relief.
(You should know that the Houston police were extremely helpful and responsive when we asked for assistance in connection with the October 26 threat to the Enron building.)
We have responded to the City's RFP for energy service.
EES made a presentation last week proposing a 5-7 year transaction
The city is opting for a 1-2 year transaction
That would require very detailed load data which is in Reliant's possession.
We have expressed concern that we are merely a stalking horse in the city's effort to do a deal with Reliant.  We have said that we won't play on those terms.
Separately, we are working with the city on a demand side deal.

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Now that you're back, I'll start bombarding you with budget questions:

- Rick has asked that all charitable contributions budgeted in his group be run through Community Relations.  I'll forward the numbers to Elyse and Misha.  Are there any other groups within Public Affairs that you want to do this as well?  For example, Palmer has made some this year, as have you.  

I'm guessing the Terraso and Kimberly should continue to budget this in their cost centers.

- What sorts of metrics do you want to show in our Skilling meeting?  (I'm assuming for Public Affairs.)
	- Do you want to illustrate value added (origination/risk mitigation/market opening/earned media)?
	- I'll do a chart showing difference year to year, and the composition of such difference.  Do you want to break this down 	by group?  Do you also want to illustrate headcount differences?
	- In the past we've illustrated fixed (empl and empl expenses) vs. variable (everything else) costs.  Do you want a chart to 	illustrate this?

   To:     All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
   Subject:  Security Update


   Enron  has  been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
   Some  of  the  changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
   personnel)  and  some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
   be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on everyday
   activities.   In  all  the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
   will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to
   increase  your  sense  of  security,  while  doing  our best to minimize
   disruption to our day-to-day business.

   Primary  responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business
   controls  organization.  You can contact this organization through their
   website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or
   by                   email                  (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
   <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   John  Brindle, Senior Director,
   Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide
   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions, or to report
   security threats.

   We  have  two  areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our travel
   advisory.

   Access to the Enron Center

   Over  the next few days, the following access control procedures will be
   instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

        ?  As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the
           Enron  Center,  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the
           bearer.

        ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a
           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center (U.S.
           driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S.
           federal, state or local identification).

        ?   Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when
           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill
           out  the  visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID
           (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form
           of  U.S.  federal,  state  or  local identification) will not be
           allowed access to the Enron Center.

        ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an Enron
           employee or badged contractor at all times.

        ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by an
           Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log
           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or  badged
           contractor,   and   escorted   to  their  appointment.   At  the
           conclusion  of  the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge
           collected,  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the plaza
           reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

        ?  Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of
           their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious
           activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors
           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open, allowing
           ""tail gating"" by others.

   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to be
   instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient during
   congested  times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard
   personnel  and  equipment,  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We
   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security
   of all our employees.


   Travel Advisory Update

   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we  have  two important
   recommendations:

        ?   While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.
           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during this
           time  to  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
           Sudan,  Somalia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Georgia,  and  the
           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In addition, we recommend that
           planned   travel  to  Egypt,  Israel,  Gaza/West  Bank,  Jordan,
           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very carefully
           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry his/her
           ""registration""  documentation  with  them at all times. This can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment
           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary
           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been
           asking  domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current
           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your
           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

"RE: barton react latest version with edits","We should get the focus off of ""micromanaging FERC"".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the ""gerrymandering"" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a ""camel"" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the ""electricity gerrymandering"" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Mark, I'm sure you are aware of the comments in the press that I have copied and inserted here below.  There have been others that are similar.  Basically, the press is reporting that we have dissolved the LJM partnerships, ended all relationships with the LJM entities, etc.  All that we have done is unwind the raptor entities, LJM still exists, all other transactions with LJM still exist, it's just that Andy sold his interest in the partnerships.  Michael Kopper owns them and would probably be considered a ""friend of Enron"" by investors/journalists.

I'm concerned about our efforts to build back investor confidence - do we correct the press?  how do we address this?  I'm concerned that we will once again be hit with credibility concerns when the press or investors fully understand that LJM still exists and we have deals still pending with it and have deals still in place with it.  How do we correct this erroneous press?   Sherron Watkins

Dear Mr. Lay

I am a reporter with The Asian Wall Street Journal and I understand that you
have written to the Indian Prime Minister to complain about the Indian
government's lack of co-operation regarding Dabhol. Is it correct that Enron
is now threatening to sue the Indian government, MSEB and GOS for a total of
US$ 4 bn to US$ 5 billion ?

I am very interested in pursuing this story given the lack of action by the
Indian authorities and wonder if you would be kind enough to verify that you
have indeed sent this letter to the Prime Minister

Thank you for your help, Sara Webb

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures""). These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 
http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp 
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

Cindy  Thanks.  Let me give you a heads up.  You may be called by Bruce Nichols of the Dallas Morning News/ Houston Bureau.  He is an old friend and probably the best reporter in town.....and a big Ken Lay champion.  He's doing a story on the impact of Ken's current intense involvement in the company on his civic leadership.  The question is whether or not Houston was losing Ken's leadership because of his current Enron involvement.  My response obviouly was that the community benefitted greatly from his leadership during the many years that he served as the CEO, so the current situation is familiar territory.  I gave him your name because of your role.  Bruce is very supportive of Ken, and attended the press conference a couple of days ago.

New adds to the board include:
Fred Burns, Chairman, Wortham Foundation
Jim Flores, Chairman & CEO, Plains Resources
Bob Harvey, Vice Chairman, Reliant
Bob Onstead
Al Bledsoe, Managing Partner, PriceWaterhouse Coopers (Al served previously in his Coopers capacity)

"Re: NEW DRAFT OF ENRON STATEMENT","I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

"Reply to Paul Krugman's column (Enron Goes Overboard, August 17)","	Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its management in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.  I have refrained from responding until now.  Below (and in the attached in Word format) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).  Thank you for your consideration.

Steven J. Kean

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Management Changes

Let me also update you on some recent management changes that reflect the broad, deep team that we have at Enron.  

Lou Pai, former Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, is no longer with Enron, and we thank him for his years of service.  Tom White, who had served as Vice Chairman with Lou, accepted the position of Secretary of the Army. 

Dave Delainey has taken over as Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave is extremely well prepared for this new role, and we look forward to investors getting to know him.  Seven years ago, Dave joined Enron Canada, where he led the growth of our Canadian business, then led all our North American origination activity and most recently ran our entire North America wholesale business.

Many of you know Kevin Hannon, who had been president and COO of our broadband business.  Kevin is now CEO of our global asset operations, which includes all our assets and activities outside of North America and Europe. 

Jim Fallon was recently named President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron Broadband Services.  Jim was instrumental in developing Enron's power marketing business.  For the last year, Jim has been responsible for all of EBS' domestic and international bandwidth intermediation activities.

"RE: How's morale!","I think the answer is this:  fully consistent with the successful completion of the transaction with Dynegy we are taking the actions we need to take to stabilize Enron's situation.  These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a ""no shop"" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

Steve, you may be aware that we are featuring an article on the PRC process in the Enron Business that we're editing now. The issue is due to be published in two weeks.

Karen has made her comments on the story; I'd appreciate hearing what you have to say.

I haven't reviewed the story yet with HR (David Oxley is my contact).I've made sure that the story is balanced, accurate and fair. My fear is that HR will not want us to publish any negative comments on the process. If so, I think they would be overlooking an effective and credible method of communicating why the PRC process is so important to how Enron does business. 

Sarah has already discussed with Beth Tilney that we will publish another article in the next issue when the Culture Committee's recommendations on PRC are fully developed and ready to be implemented. 

We are working on a tight deadline, and I suspect the  review process will be lengthy. I hope you can return it sometime Monday.

Thanks,
Jeannie

Steve, is this anything Enron would be interested in doing?  I seriously doubt it, but these people are relentless in wanting to schedule a meeting with Jeff (even though the dates they wanted to do it passed two weeks ago).  I received another call today.  If it wasn't E&Y, I'd just say no, but wanted to run it by you before telling them ""absolutely not and please don't call here anymore!""  Thanks, SRS

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Professor Amabile,

I work for Enron, a leading energy company based in Houston.  I believe you recently presented some of your research on creativity and motivation to members of our management team.  I am responsible for preparing the business agenda for Enron's annual Management Conference.  Scheduled in San Antonio on November 15-16, the two-day meeting brings together more than 400 Enron executives.

Enron has been named most innovative company for six consecutive years by Fortune magazine.  However, this year has been challenging for the company.  External market issues and internal restructurings have resulted in a depressed stock price and low moral among employees.  

Your insights on creating a motivating work environment and stimulating innovation would be especially interesting at this year's conference.  If you are interested in presenting to our group, I'd like to explore your availability the morning of Friday, November 16.

Please feel free to respond to my email or call me at 713-853-7727.  I look forward to hearing from you.

I am looking for some help in identifying the right person(s) at: Enron
Corp., for an introduction of our software solution.  Steven, if you could
take a moment and point me to the appropriate contact I would greatly
appreciate it.

Summary of eProvisioning:
 
eProvisioning radically improves people's Time-To-Productivity by
transforming the disparate activities that allocate IT resources to people
into a secure and automatic process. Once provisioned, these resources
remain digitally connected to each person as they move through the business
cycle and are dynamically updated as necessary. At the appropriate time,
they are systematically, securely and automatically removed.  

Organizations that employ eProvisioning gain a competitive edge and access
complete security by ensuring that people are kept productive from day one,
and are prevented from becoming counterproductive beyond the day they leave.
In addition, by aligning their IT infrastructure with business priorities,
organizations can effectively manage change across the extended enterprise,
and better respond to emerging market requirements. 

eProvision Day One provides business and IT executives with the ability to
quickly identify bottlenecks and maintain accountability of the
eProvisioning process through comprehensive reporting and tracking
capabilities. As business relationships between organizations expand,
Business Layers technology provides the framework for integration and
interoperability between eProvisioning partners - suppliers and service
providers, devices and applications - which are the digital foundations of
the Internet economy. 

Please, if you could give me a few minutes of your valuable time or guide me
to the right person to describe the significant benefits of what we offer.""

Steve,

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 

I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.

Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.

Terrie

"AG letter - privileged and confidential: request for legal advice.","The letter looks good.  A couple of comments for your consideration:

On page three we describe the change to the definition of Public Utility and then argue that we don't fit into it.  Would it be worth explaining why that makes sense?  Specifically, the New Jersey restructuring law, like most efforts of its kind in other markets, is designed to separate the competitive from monopoly elements of the power (and gas) businesses.  Economic regulation would then be restricted to the remaining monopoly elements of the business (eg distribution).  The competitive market can not be solely relied upon to ""regulate"" the behavior of monopoly asset owners, such as distribution utilities.  Therefore, regulators continue to be called upon to set pricing and other terms of service.  What those regulators decide matters a great deal to those monopoly utilities and it consequently makes sense for lawmakers to be concerned about attempts by such entities to use campaign contributions to tacitly influence decision makers.  The same public policies simply do not apply to that portion of the market which is competitive.  The generation and sales business has a competitive structure (i.e. relatively low barriers to entry, multiple competitors etc.).  These components of the power and gas business can be ""regulated"" by the market with respect to rates and terms of service.  They do not require economic regulation any more than grocery stores, department stores, appliance sellers or other ""retailers"" (who presumably are not prohibited from making contributions.  Competition and markets discipline behavior and establish competitive prices and terms of service.  Because regulators don't set the prices and terms of service for such sellers, there is no reason to be concerned about campaign contribuitions from such organizations.  Indeed, the legislation, and the legislative history, clearly conform to this underlying policy rationale.
As a former practicing lawyer, I certainly understand the value of pleading in the alternative.  But, I question how certain of our arguments woud be perceived by the public if they ever came to light (which these documents have a habit of doing).. .  I can just see the press seizing on Enron's claim of ""ignorance or mistake"" or the fact that we pled for the favorable exercise of ""prosecutorial discretion"".  I suggest that we add whatever we feel is necessary to the very solid looking intent argument, not make specific reference to ""ignorance or mistake"", and not plead for the favorable esxercise of PD.  If we feel we need to write about this last item, perhaps we could suggest that it would be a waste of the public's resources to pursue a claim under such circumstances.

Either with you/or your transportation manager.  We are hearing that lots of
companies are rethinking their commercial travel for execs and that companies
are stepping up further in their purchases of Fractional Jet shares as well as
rethinking their entire fleet.  No rush.  Feel free to email or call me

Hi  Steve,
 
I was wondering if  you would have 30 minutes to meet with me sometime in the near future for  confidential reasons. You asked me on Monday if everything is ""all right"" and  the answer is ""not really."" I request this meeting for personal reasons, more on  mentor basis, than employee to employer. 
 
Would that be  possible? If so, I would also request that we meet early in the morning, or on a  conference room on another floor. It is difficult to meet on this  floor without everyone immediately knowing/questioning your intentions.  
 
Thanks for you time,  Margaret

Subject: Judge's Final SE RTO Mediation Report + CN summary


The ALJ submits her report to FERC to obtain FERC review of the Southeast Power Grid platform that resulted from the mediation. 
 
** JUDGE'S FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS:  FERC should consider adoption of Grid Model (the one Enron likes best) to fullest extent possible and that remaining unresolved issues be addressed through continued stakeholder process.  However, since complete consensus was not reached, FERC should provide its determination of which of the two models best meets FERC's expectations as a platform for the SE Power Grid RTO.  This should be done by FERC quickly.  There should be no further delay.  Regardless of the model, FERC should encourage the collaborative process.  She thinks that this should be done by the parties without FERC intervention except to the extent to respond to FERC orders. (I think FERC staff should be involved or it will get bogged down).  Parties should reconvene within 15 days after FERC's order adopting a model and the FERC order should direct the participants (like us) to submit a joint proposal within 45 days thereafter.  She recommends to FERC that parties be allowed to file comments to FERC within 20 days (however, she recommends against permitting reply comments since they may prove counterproductive to the collaborative nature of the mediation process.)  The Commission will then issue an order that can adopt her recommendations, may reject her recommendations, or change something.  I would expect that the Commission would adopt many of her recommendations, while allowing further mediated-type discussions on some issues (hopefully, FERC will adopt many of our suggested changes).  Judge McCartney then basically describes both proposals of the Grid Group and the Southern, etal. group, then provides the stakeholder participants' comments (almost verbatim from all submissions to her).  While she states that the process should keep moving quickly, she does not adopt any timeframes (we will comment that FERC should retain its Dec 02 Day 2 start date (for LMP/financial rights congestion model to be implemented).
 
The attachments below are her report, the Southern, etal proposal and the Grid pricing, congestion management, operating, and planning protocols (without any changes).  Clearly, our response FERC will include our proposed changes to the documents.  Highlights from her report below:

She recommends that SPP pursue an RTO coalition in the Midwest 
She encourages FERC to continue to encourage and utilize a collaborative process which accommodates stakeholders and state utility commission input, regardless of the RTO platform ultimately adopted by FERC 
Her opinion is that the ""Grid (Entergy, GridSouth and GridFlorida utility sponsored) Model"" (transco in RTO, LMP/financial rights congestion management) is better developed and more clearly in compliance with the requirements of Order No. 2000 based on a ""best practices"" analysis of other RTOs and Commission precedent.  This is good because Enron generally favors the Grid model. However, she does provide the Commission information on Southern, etal.'s proposal (independent system administrator--like National Grid-type) in her report, even though she has concerns that the Southern, etal model is not Order No. 2000 compliant.  The Southern, etal. model has a hybrid physical congestion management with day ahead balanced schedule requirements and LMP in real time (with penalties) and significant control area responsibilities.  The significant aspects of the Grid model are discussed below: 
Grid Governance: RTO is a for profit transco with an independent board and an enhancement:  the Independent Market Administrator (IMA).  The IMA was added to facilitate public power participation (worried that transmission owner on top, even if divested from generation, would favor its transmission solutions over generation or other transmission solution).  The IMA would administer the markets; exercise operational authority over the transmission system; administer one OASIS (with one process for interconnection and transmission requests); and assume the Security Coordinator function.  She strongly encourages this split. 
Good stakeholder advisory Committee (provides majority and minority views) and an independent Market Monitor to monitor the RTO and the markets 
Allows for Independent Transmission Companies (Entergy wants to be one), with RTO oversight 
Describes that control area operators will initially maintain their control areas for physical operation, such as switching transmission elements, pursuant to operating procedures approved by the RTO/IMA.  Recognizes that consolidation of control areas may occur as RTO matures.  (Protocols should be subject to further discussion) 
RTO/transco has primary responsibility for tariff administration, including rate changes and tariff filings 
All load under the rates, terms and conditions of OATT (GridSouth group has appealed this part of earlier Commission orders, and, thus, retains their rights should they win on appeal) 
4 transmission pricing zones initially: Entergy, Southern, GridSouth, and GridFlorida.  Allows for participant funded, direct assigned, and merchant transmission.  Transmission rates to loads in RTO will be zonal (for existing facilities) and regional charge (for new facilities, other than those above).  There will be one ""through and out rate"", plus a Grid Management Charge for RTO operation. 
Encourages conversion of existing transmission agreements to OATT 
Financial Rights/LMP (includes ""real time spot market"") is clearly the preferred model and represents best practices model (from PJM and SPP) -- many details need to be worked out in continued discussions.  Model allows parties to transact bilaterally and provides financial congestion hedges (FCH).  Stakeholder process needs to be continued for FCH allocation, auction and non-discriminatory release.  The Grid model includes a ""balancing resource"" requirement that we will provide comments against 
Will allow establishment of markets for ancillary services once they can be supported -- control area operators required to provide before such market establishment 
RTO runs single OASIS and independently calculates ATC and TTC 
RTO/transco is responsible for planning through a participatory stakeholder process 
Numerous comments from marketers, IPPs on reduction of control area functions (all of our comments from last week's response are included) 
Judge McCartney had numerous meetings with state commissioners.  (1) Many are still concerned that FERC had not conducted a ""cost-benefit"" analysis and had concerns over the costs.  She responds that extrapolation of costs to the entire SE RTO seems unwarranted because it ignores the ""economies of scale"" and initial reliance on existing control centers and infrastructure.  In any event, FERC could explore the feasibility of a rate setting process that would involve the state commissions. (2) concerned about cost shifting:  mediation team discussed phase in of rates that the Commission has allowed. (3) Concern that SE RTO would preempt state ability to approve asset transfers to RTO and want state retail customers to receive full value for assets.  (4) concern that SE RTO may prematurely put Southern states into retail open access (concerns with Cal.)  Judge encourages the Commission to utilize a collaborative process that includes input from state commissioners.

I think our message for any press discussions tomorrow should focus on the extremely beneficial aspects of the mediation and the significant ""jump start"" it gave to the SE RTO process due to the significant role played by Judge McCartney and her team on focusing the discussions.  Furthermore, the initial results after 45 days show the majority of participants favoring a ""best practices"" PJM/SPP cornerstone type real time spot energy market with LMP pricing and financial congestion hedges and an RTO with an independent board structure that accommodates a for-profit RTO entity with a significant stakeholder advisory process.  The Commission should consider utilize the fundamentals resulting from this mediation for other regions, or, at a minimum, consider similar mediated ""jump starts.""

How is everything?  I hope all is well.  I just wanted keep you updated on what I am doing.  I started with the 2001 Associate pool on August 6.  Currently, I am assigned to the East Power Fundamental Group under Lloyd Will.  I am doing fundamental analysis for the power traders and not surprisingly, most of the traders are not fond of AEP.  I think it's a good rotation in that the knowledge I gain in this group will help me immensely in a more commercial role in the future.

I am very interested in structuring and M&A work, at the same time trading is also something I would love to do should such opportunity become available.  I will try to look into the trading track program once I get settled here.  My wife is currently finishing her Masters degree at Columbia in Electrical Engineering and will look to find a job in Houston once she obtains her degree.

I will keep you updated on my future progress and please let me know if you have any suggestions.

In an FT article today it says that:

?	The quality of earnings at Enron has deteriorated
?	behind the scenes financial engineering has increased
Therefore the overall standing of Enron in Wall Street has plummeted.

How do you envisage changing this perception of Enron and change investor sentiment towards the Enron stock.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

"RE: Enron Stakeholder Perception Survey Questionnaire - for review","I think we will get alot of ""don't knows"" when we ask the questions about what the respondent's companies are doing.  We can probably find a better tool than a survey to get at that infromation.  I'm not opposed to including those questions if you think we will get useful data, but I raise the issue in case there are other questions you mihgt want to ask but didn't have time for. 

 I don't think we will be able to categorize customers in terms of whether they are lapsed, current or prospective.  That information is kept on an inconsistent and decentralized basis in the company.

Finally, given Enron's focus on the day-to-day, I wouldn't count to heavily on getting alot of help putting together the stakeholder sample.  You should have a back-up plan.

Thanks for the opportunity to comment.  I am very much looking forward to reviewing the results.

Subject:	Enron Stakeholder Perception Survey Questionnaire - for review

Steve, Mike and Mark,

As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).

The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.

Thank you,
Catherine

I work in ENA producer finance (Thompson and Josey's group). Glad to see you are keeping the world at bay.

I quickly picked up my copy of Red Herring yesterday to read the Enron article. Their insight into Enron or lack thereof aside, I assume you will respond to the price gouging assertions which they prominently feature on page 21 (LEADER). Perhaps this has occurred already, if so, thanks.

Interesting that we had Tony Perkins speak to us last November in San Antonio.

"Re: A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy","Let's talk.  While there is always some value in these things it is ususally quite small and consumes more valuable resources in trying to capture the benefit than the benefit itself.

Subject:	A&M - Bush Library Foundation & School of Public Policy

Steve-

We have been approached by the Texas A&M/George Bush Presidential Library Foundation and School of Public Policy to endow additional funds.

Enron had made an original contribution to the library foundation back in 1998 totaling $250K over five years.

I am working with Community Relations and A/A Recruiting to evaluate the latest request and to discuss where Enron may have interest or find leverage for our Government Affairs, Recruiting, or PR efforts.

The Foundation is willing to work with us to establish whatever type of program(s) and/or participatory involvement we would like.  We have discussed an Enron speaker series, classroom lectures, advisory committee seats and the likes.

I have already had a chance to run this by Rick Shapiro and Rob Bradley.  Although Rick was noncommittal regarding his team's time for speaking or lecturing, he seemed supportive of the effort.  Rob has already been participating in some speaking opportunities there, and supported expanded efforts.

What are your thoughts on contribution levels (another $250K was suggested by CR) and any specific program or relationship opportunities regarding the Library Center or School of Public Policy.

Please grab me for quick conversation when you have time.

Thanks.

Mike

"Organizational statistics","Attached is an organizational statistics summary for the first half of 2001.  The HR organization has been working to develop meaningful reporting of trends in our employee population.  A few highlights from this report:

The employee base continues to grow (though on a significantly slower pace than 2000).
Terminations (voluntary and involuntary) are up dramatically this year.
Our ""contribution loss"" (a statistic which uses terminations weighted by the performance ratings of those leaving) has gone up, indicating that we are losing more high performers than in previous periods.  However, those departures of high performers are concentrated in areas of substantial reorganizations (EBS, the former EE&CC and HPL).
Let us know if you would like to see additional items on the report or if you have questions about the data.

Holly is currently based at the Ardmore facility but needs a space here.  All she needs is 
a desk and a phone.  We already have equipment for her to use, so nothing has to be ordered.

Q:  From a business standpoint are Gipper and Rockne now one company?

A:  Not until closing, which may not occur for several months.  Until that time the law [antitrust law] requires that we continue to deal with one another on a commercial level as competitors, just as we have in the past.  In general, this means that we cannot share commercial information, coordinate commercial behavior, agree on prices, etc.  We should act towards Rockne the same way that we would act toward any other competitor.

I trust this is what you needed.  If not just let me know.  Thanks.

Enron's Skilling Cites Stock-Price Plunge
As Main Reason for Leaving CEO Post
By John R. Emshwiller

08/16/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A2
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  Jeffrey K. Skilling said that the pressure he felt from Enron Corp.'s
plummeting stock price was the main reason he decided to resign Tuesday
as the energy giant's chief executive officer after only about six
months in the job.

   In an interview yesterday, the 47-year-old Mr. Skilling elaborated on
his decision to leave Houston-based Enron. On Tuesday, Mr. Skilling
insisted he had resigned for ""personal reasons"" unrelated to Enron's
business activities.
   In the interview, he reiterated that he wasn't under any pressure to
resign from the company's board or Chairman Kenneth Lay, who has resumed
the CEO's duties at the nation's biggest energy trader.

   However, yesterday Mr. Skilling said that his ""personal reasons"" were
deeply enmeshed with feelings that he had failed in a crucial business
area during his brief tenure as CEO. Calling the company's stock
performance a ""kind of ultimate score card,"" Mr. Skilling noted that
Enron's share price had fallen by some 50% this year.

   Mr. Skilling said he took that stock-price drop very personally. ""I
put a lot of pressure on myself"" for that decline, he said. ""I felt I
must not be communicating well enough"" with investors. He felt this
particularly given Enron's strong financial results over the past
several quarters, based largely on growing volumes in its trading
business, which covers a range of items, including electricity, pulp and
paper.

   If the stock price had remained up ""I don't think I would have felt
the pressure to leave,"" he said.

   In January, Enron topped $84 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. It closed Tuesday, before the announcement of Mr.
Skilling's resignation, at $42.93 a share. As of 4 p.m. yesterday, Enron
traded at $40.25, after falling below $37 during the day.

   Mr. Skilling, who had been at Enron 11 years, said the depressed
stock price was particularly tough to explain to fellow Enron employees,
many of whom are shareholders. ""People would say `What is going on with
the stock, Jeff?' I would have to say I didn't know. It has been
frustrating,"" said Mr. Skilling.

   The self-portrait offered by Mr. Skilling in the interview is rather
different from the widely held image of him as an ambitious, bright and
thick-skinned business strategist whose long-held goal had been becoming
Enron CEO. Mr. Skilling said that the ""final straw"" in his decision to
leave had come on a visit last week to England in connection with the
deaths of three Enron workers in a power-plant accident there. That trip
helped reinforce ""how tenuous life is,"" said Mr. Skilling, who has three
children from a previous marriage and recently became engaged.

   While Mr. Skilling said Enron is in ""great shape,"" his departure
raised anxiety in the investment community. Merrill Lynch, for instance,
lowered its rating on Enron to neutral from buy based on ""uncertainty""
created by the resignation.

   Yesterday, an Enron spokesman confirmed that Mr. Lay plans to name
two executives to the existing ""office of the chairman"" within the next
few days or weeks. The spokesman said Mr. Lay hadn't yet revealed whom
the two would be. The office of the chairman had consisted of Mr. Lay
and Mr. Skilling.

Subject:	Show Cause Motion

I spoke with Paul on Friday regarding his meeting with Adam Wenner and Doug Nickles to discuss Portland General's concerns about the Show Cause Motion.  While Doug was unsure of whether an RTO commitment would be necessary in a future sale of Portland General, Adam Wenner assured Doug that FERC would definately require Portland to make an RTO commitment.

In the last attempted merger with Sierra, Portland made a commitment to join an RTO, provided that BPA was also part of that RTO.  PGE explained that because its system is so intertwined with BPA, that it realistically could not join an RTO without BPA.  FERC found this commitment, with the BPA qualification, to be acceptable.

While PGE would probably be willing to make the same RTO commitment that it made last time, the Show Cause Motion goes farther than that.  We say in the Show Cause Motion that every entity must make an unqualified commitment to join a FERC approved RTO.  It does not provide for exceptions.  

A couple of things came out of Paul's meeting with Doug.  First, Doug asks that we delay filing the Motion for a couple of weeks, to see if anything happens regarding a new sale of PGE.  Doug is concerned that if we make a commitment before an agreement is reached, that the existence of the commitment could delay entering into a final sales agreement.  

Second, we need to decide how to deal with the PGE commitment.  It is unlikely that PGE will be willing to commit to RTO participation without BPA.  Paul and I discussed that perhaps we could reference in the Show Cause Motion the Federal Power Marketing Agencies and the need for them to join in the RTOs in order for the utilities to make an RTO commitment - perhaps reference Pacific Northwest particularly, although this looks a little transparent.  The problem is that many entities will try and use this as an excuse to not join an RTO.

Also, Paul and I discussed the ""One Western RTO"" issue and how Enron responds to that.  We talked about three possibilities: 1) try to not take a position on the One Western RTO issue -- push for RTO development in the west but try and stay out of the one-versus-two-versus-three RTOs in the West; 2) take a position saying that the west is different, the California mess continues, people are concerned that California will contaminate the rest of the west, so we should create an RTO in the rest of the West and have California join when it gets in line with FERC; 3) support FERC's statements that it wants one RTO in the west and push for this (although most of our people tell us that this will lead to inaction on any western RTO development); or 4)  focus on the east and forget about the west.

The second option causes me concern because I think that, if we take this position in the West, even though the West is different, our position will be used against us in the East.  For example, some people oppose one Northeast RTO because they are concerned that New York (a disfunctional market) will contaminate PJM (a working market).  It's a slippery slope for us to try and distinguish the west from the east.  If we make contrary arguments in the west, they will be used against us in the east.

Your thoughts are appreciated.  Thanks

Sarah

Rick,
As the press seems to be turning worse, I would strongly advise Enron to call George Sard of Citigate Sard Verbinnen at (212) 687-8080.  George is probably the leading crisis communications advisor in the world and could offer them great counsel, especially in distributing and managing the current press release.  We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation.
Hope that's helpful.
Kristin

Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.

I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will not be affected.

I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up immediately)

UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
Prudential (another option with internal connections)

let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

I agree with Beth.  We had some other options to pursue before we got to that stage, but the Dynegy option was the best.  It's overstating it a bit to say it was the only way to keep the ship from going down.

Steve and Cindy,

Below is the message I'm intending to send out to the business units about the Management Conference ""Home Video"" project.  I wanted to be sure you were both comfortable with the direction I'm providing and the topics being proposed.  (Of course, I'm allowing the businesses to generate their own as well.)

As for who is to receive the ""challenge,"" here's a potential list:
Enron Corp.: Rick Causey, Andy Fastow, Mark Frevert, Steve Kean, Mark Koenig, Ken Lay, Greg Whalley
EES: Dave Delainey, Janet Dietrich
ETS: Stan Horton, Dan McCarty
Industrial Markets: Jeff McMahon, Ray Bowen
Enron Europe: John Sherriff, Michael Brown
Enron Broadband:  Jim Fallon, Rich DiMichelle
Enron Americas: John Lavorato, Louise Kitchen
Global Markets: Mike McConnell, Jeff Shankman
Enron Net Works: Greg Piper, Sally Beck

(I also intend to cc the memo to all the communication people: Mark Palmer, Gina Taylor, Kal Shah, Eric Thode, Beth Tilney, John Ambler, and me.)

Let me know if you have any changes or comments.  To allow plenty of time to produce these videos, I hope to get this memo out later this week.

Subject:	Enron Management Conference - Home Video Project

  
The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, ane even poke fun and laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous ""Home Video"" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  Some ideas include:
Accounting Procedures
Cost Cutting
Deal Making
Innovation
Management Changes
PRC
Public Relations
Reorganizations
Stock Price
Trading/Traders

There are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intentions to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be granted for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, ""Enny"" will also be awarded for ""Best Overall Video.""

If you have any questions about the ""Home Video"" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.  Good luck and happy filming!

Dear Ms.Olson: 

I was speaking with Missy Stephens yesterday and she told me you would be the 
appropriate person to address this request. 

I am excited to be working on many development and event projects, and it is 
in that context that I write. 

I know you are familiar with The Houston Forum's long-standing reputation as 
the preeminent speakers forum in Houston. I know they welcome your support 
and sponsorship in any way you deem appropriate, but we hope Enron is able to 
participate as a program underwriter and/or sponsor. The following is a list 
of the confirmed speakers over the next several months as well as those 
pending for 2002: 

1. The Honorable Alberto Gonzales, Cousel to the President George  W. Bush 
will join us for a luncheon program on Sept. 7th at the Houston Club. This 
program is being done in conjunction with the Houston Bar Association. 

2. Robert Reynolds-Vice Chairman and COO of Fidelity Investments is 
presenting on September 19th in a late afternoon event at the Junior League. 

3. Septemeber 24th is our Energy Roundtable luncheon program-moderated by 
Matt Simmons of Simmons & Co.-at the Hyatt Regency. 

4. On October 3rd, we host Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand-the director 
General of the World Trade Organization. This is a luncheon program to be 
held at the Houston Club. 

5. November 13th we will welcome presidential historian and analyst, Michael 
Beschloss. Dr. Beschloss will discuss his most recent publication on the 
tapes of President Lyndon Johnson. This will be a very popular event and 
there are special sponsorship opportunities attendant with it. 

6. On December 6th, we are pleased to host The Honorable David Ivry-Israel's 
Ambassador to the United States. This afternoon program will take place at 
the Junior League. 

7. March 11, 2002, is the date for our luncheon program at the Hyatt Regency. 
Our very special guest will be the Honorable James A. Baker III, 61st U. S. 
Secretary of State. This event will certainly sell out. 

8. State Senator Rodney Ellis will join us on April 28, 2002. 

Robert Bartley, Editor of the Wall Street Journal, will be speaking in 2002, 
but the date and venue are pending. We are also planning on hosting the 
Honorable John Breaux, U. S. Senator, and Cabinet officials Paul O'Neill and 
Spencer Abraham. 

If I might, let me share with you the particulars of the sponsorships and 
underwriting options available to  you. 

A sponsorship of $10,000 will enable you or your designee to introduce the 
speaker from the podium. You will also be given 8 memberships for a year and 
2 tables for the luncheon that you particularly sponsor. Additionally, you 
will have your logo on the program on the day of the event as well as on the 
website that enumerates all of our programs. You and your designees will be 
able to attend all private receptions before our events. 

A $2,500 sponsorship will provide Enron program logo exposure on the day of 
the event, a free table for 10 on that date, an invitation to the private 
reception prior to the event and a presence on our website. Finally, you will 
be given 4 complimentary memberships for a year. 

A donation of $1,000 will enable you to place your logo on our program on the 
day of the event. 

All of your sponsorships/donations are tax deductible and you will be 
identified as a sponsor in all of our corporate literature for a year. 

The November 13th program with Dr.Beschloss provides, as mentioned, special 
visibility. In addition to all things inherent in the $2,500 sponsorship, a 
$7,500 donation gives that particular sponsor a chance to print and insert 
corporate bookplates in all of our speaker's books to be sold at the event. 
You will also be able to separately sponsor a dinner with Dr. Beschloss and 
the guests of your choice. 

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to visit 
with  you in person if you would like. Again, thank you for your time and 
consideration of these high profile programs. I will follow up on this note 
in 2 weeks. 

Sincerely, 

Sherry Solomon

Corporate Business Controls - Position Elimination - Portland Office 
I wanted to ensure that you were aware that John's group has one (1) employee (Chad Beers) in the Portland office who will be asked to relocate to Houston no later than 01/02/02, as the position in Portland is scheduled to be eliminated effective 01/02/02.  
Therefore, if the employee elects not to accept the position in Houston his employment would be terminated on 01/02/02 and he would be scheduled to receive the current business reorganization severance.

Based on this request, I plan to send Chad a Relocation Offer letter which also includes the information summarized above along with a severance calculation estimate.  

Could you please respond to this e-mail to indicate your concurrence.  If you do concur, I will proceed with associated paperwork.

FYI gents - the meeting yesterday with the Arizona DEQ did not result in significant progress. Basically the agency folks at that level are simply not motivated to engage in any effort to accelerate the permitting.  Local counsel is going to visit informally today with the agency's counsel to see if some progress can be made and attempt to set a meeting with higher level agency personnel early next week.

Good Morning Kalen--

Since the attack on America, last week, 9/11/01--Life as we know it will never be the same.  Although, as a nation, ( individuals) we are trying to recover & put the pieces back, we know the journey ahead will be hard ( especially after what Bush discussed last night).  I bring this up for several reasons; as an American & an Enron employee.  After talking w/ Enron employees, about terrorists attacks, possible cell groups in our own back yard--we are fearful--this is an understatement.  However, we know, as employees, the importance of getting back to the work, Enron is paying us to do.  How do we balance the two?  I have some ideas I have shared with Leasa & Judy--I'd like to suggest them to you, as I feel they are steps we can put into place to help our Enron employees feel safe.

1)Let's have an evacuation drill
2) On your floor know where the nearest stairwell (s) are located
3) Someone assigned to a handicapped employee--in the event of an evacuation--this person would ensure they get out safely
4) Update floor/ fire warden--who are they?  Leasa told me that the one on our floor is from 1998
5) Have one or two contacts in each group that would be responsible for making sure everyone knew what was happening in the event of an evacuation ( people come in @ different times etc...)
6) Vent/ talk meetings w/ managers over lunch ( see paragraph #2 for explanation)

Also, I do not think it is unreasonable to think some of our employees are suffering from ( or will suffer from) Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome! I propose that managers/ leaders of groups hold a ""vent/ talk"" meeting--over lunch--where employees can feel free to talk about their concerns, fears, anger etc..--It is so important that we do this.  If not some of the repercussions may be people resigning -for fear of working downtown/ in a high-rise etc...( Judy & I talked about this). 

I feel this is an opportunity for HR to really make a difference/ contribute/ & have a strong impact, in assuring our employees we are taking active measures to ensure their safety & want to address their feelings.    I'd like to know what your thoughts are on this?  If you'd like to discuss the further, I'd welcome the opportunity.

Thank you for your time.

Johanna

Mr. Kean,
I want to thank you and your group for keeping us informed of new safety
rules so we all understand the reasons for the changes.  I have 1
question.

Will you be sharing/reviewing/revising fire drill/building evacuation
instructions.  In the past, our fire drills have instructed us just to
go
to the door of the stairwells.  If we really had to evacuate the
building,
where should we go after we exit the stairwells and building?  Would the
recommendation be to wait in the park area in front of ECN, walk towards
an
area that is not near high structures, a freeway underpass, etc. or is
that
decision left to our discretion?

Thanks, Lillian Villarreal - ETS IT group

   Subject:  Security Update


   Enron  has  been increasing security at its facilities around the
world.
   Some  of  the  changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional
security
   personnel)  and  some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes
will
   be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on
everyday
   activities.   In  all  the steps we take and recommendations we make,
we
   will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
to
   increase  your  sense  of  security,  while  doing  our best to
minimize
   disruption to our day-to-day business.

   Primary  responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our
business
   controls  organization.  You can contact this organization through
their
   website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804),
or
   by                   email
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com
   <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   John  Brindle, Senior
Director,
   Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to
provide
   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions, or to
report
   security threats.

   We  have  two  areas to update you on:  changes in the access
procedures
   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our
travel
   advisory.

   Access to the Enron Center

   Over  the next few days, the following access control procedures will
be
   instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where
practical):

        ?  As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
the
           Enron  Center,  a guard will match the photo on the badge to
the
           bearer.

        ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must
present a
           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center
(U.S.
           driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of
U.S.
           federal, state or local identification).

        ?   Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
when
           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely
fill
           out  the  visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo
ID
           (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some
form
           of  U.S.  federal,  state  or  local identification) will not
be
           allowed access to the Enron Center.

        ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an
Enron
           employee or badged contractor at all times.

        ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by
an
           Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's
log
           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or
badged
           contractor,   and   escorted   to  their  appointment.   At
the
           conclusion  of  the appointment, the visitor will be escorted
to
           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor
badge
           collected,  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the
plaza
           reception area by the escorting employee or badged
contractor.

        ?  Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
of
           their workplace by following these guidelines; report
suspicious
           activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured
doors
           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open,
allowing
           ""tail gating"" by others.

   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to
be
   instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient
during
   congested  times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased
guard
   personnel  and  equipment,  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.
We
   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the
security
   of all our employees.


   Travel Advisory Update

   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we  have  two
important
   recommendations:

        ?   While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate
security
           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be
avoided.
           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during
this
           time  to  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq,
           Sudan,  Somalia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Georgia,  and
the
           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In addition, we recommend
that
           planned   travel  to  Egypt,  Israel,  Gaza/West  Bank,
Jordan,
           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very
carefully
           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States,
corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There
have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside
in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for
documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we
suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the
United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien
status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.
We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry
their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status
as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration
Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality
Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry
his/her
           ""registration""  documentation  with  them at all times. This
can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card,
Employment
           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a
Temporary
           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically
been
           asking  domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation,
but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and
current
           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of
your
           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on
the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Traders, Old Utilities Tangle Over Wires 
By Dan Morgan
Washington Post Staff Writer
Thursday, August 23, 2001; Page A01 
Last of three articles
ATLANTA
Ever since steamboat captain W.P. Lay founded Alabama Power Co. in 1906 to develop electricity along the Coosa River, utility companies have been stringing wires throughout the South for one purpose: so southerners could have power and light.
Now a bunch of outsiders, who buy and sell electricity but don't have a single retail customer below the Mason-Dixon line, have their sights set on those wires, and they are getting a helping hand from some powerful allies in Congress and the Bush administration.
Aided by supercomputers, and operating out of trading rooms as big as hockey rinks, the new breed of traders buy blocks of electricity anywhere along the nation's power grid, then borrow transmission lines to ship it to the highest bidder. But to more effectively move power from where it is cheap to where it is in strong demand, they want to remove what they contend is a ""wire curtain"" around the South. That means forcing the southeastern utilities to relinquish control of the wires to a new, federally supervised regional authority.
""The monopoly is the wires, and that's where the battles occur,"" said Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was chief executive of Houston's Enron Corp., the largest of the power merchants, until he resigned last week.
The clash grows out of a huge federal gamble on electricity deregulation.
In 1992, with many utility behemoths staggering under debt from cost overruns on nuclear plants and the rapid spread of computer technology putting new demands on the grid, Congress opted for a competitive market. The plan was to dismantle long-standing utility monopolies and replace them with innovative electricity companies responsive to the laws of supply and demand.
Now these new merchants of power, along with restructured utilities that have shed their old ways and embraced the new competitive world, have become strong advocates for a free-flowing, national electricity market. But in a classic Washington lobbying confrontation, they are running into resistance from traditional utilities, exemplified by Atlanta's Southern Co., now the parent of Alabama Power and other southern utilities.
At issue is how fast the federal government, in the wake of the California electricity crisis, should push for yet more changes.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), recently stocked with President Bush's pro-market appointees, ordered most utilities to negotiate with federal mediators on procedures for handing over control of their wires to a few big regional authorities. Those authorities, in turn, will build new transmission lines, do away with bottlenecks, set uniform rates and ensure equal access to all. Next month, the Senate will take up proposals to give FERC even more authority to restructure the electricity industry.
But what is good for Enron may not necessarily be good for utility customers in the South, according to executives at Southern Co., whose affiliates dominate power sales in Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and north Florida. Southern Co., Chairman H. Allen Franklin said in a recent interview, ""will not go blindly"" into the system proposed by FERC.
Although unfettered access to Southern's 26,650 miles of lines might help long-distance sellers of wholesale power such as Enron, company officials say it could mean congestion, power outages and higher prices for their 3.9 million retail customers.
""When California was restructured, it was thought there would be massive savings,"" Franklin said. ""Well, there haven't been.""
Building the Power Trade
If the California energy crisis left doubts about the future of a competitive market in electricity, a visit to Houston dispels them.
In the city's energy alley, Enron Corp. -- with annual sales of more than $100 billion last year, double those of Texaco -- is finishing a new 40-floor office building adjacent to its 50-story tower. Enron's competitors, Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy and El Paso Energy, are a few blocks away. Duke Energy North American, merchant arm of Charlotte-based Duke Power, has settled in as well. And Calpine Corp. plans to take over 12 floors of a new 32-story building near Enron.
These power merchants are at the center of a burgeoning unregulated wholesale market, which now handles about a quarter of U.S. electricity output. But it is still a work in progress, fluid and accommodating in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest but much less open in the South.
In exchange for utilities opening up their transmission lines to the new wholesale market, the 1992 Energy Policy Act law allowed them to buy or build unregulated power plants outside their service areas. Many did. Quickest to embrace competition were California and the Northeast, which had long endured high power costs. To spur competition, California and some northeastern states went further, requiring utilities to sell off their regulated plants and begin buying bulk power from wholesalers.
Many states went further still, ending their utilities' long monopoly over retail sales and allowing customers to pick their own electricity provider.
The Northeast already was something of a mecca for power traders because of its experiments with power pooling, in which groups of utilities merge their separate transmission systems and use a central manager to market and distribute their electricity.
Enron, formed in 1985 by the merger of two big gas-pipeline companies, was quick to seize the opportunities. Its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a former official at the Federal Power Commission, FERC's precursor, during the Nixon administration, had pioneered natural gas trading during the volatile period of pipeline deregulation in the 1980s.
As the electricity market began to develop in the early 1990s, Lay and Skilling, a weekend dirt biker with a degree from Harvard Business School, began applying some of the lessons learned in the natural gas markets.
Enron signed its first long-term power contract in 1989, Skilling recalls. Independent companies that wanted to install gas-fired generators and sell the power on the grid could buy the gas from Enron under long-term contract -- then sell the electricity back to Enron.
""We started creating forward and futures markets"" using ""a lot more financial engineering"" than was required in other commodity businesses, Skilling said. By the late 1990s, Enron was buying the output of generating plants days, weeks, months and even years before it was produced, using sophisticated weather and economic data to predict a price at which it could be profitably sold.
During the past five years, Enron has been one of the nation's fastest-growing companies. Its net income rose 40 percent in the second quarter of this year, although the price of a share has sunk to less than half of its 2000 high of $90, mainly because of setbacks in businesses unrelated to electricity. Investors pushed the price still lower after Skilling's departure last week.
Southern Inhospitality
Like other merchants, Enron plunged into California after the legislature opened up that giant state to electricity competition. But the Southeast remained less-friendly territory.
Texas is the only southern state to adopt retail deregulation. Florida goes so far as to ban out-of-state companies from building almost any plant for the wholesale market.
The region is the domain of huge traditional utilities that control the wires from Louisiana to Florida and up into Appalachia and the Carolinas. The web of power lines, tied to the utilities' coal-, nuclear- and gas-fired generating plants, reaches across states via 500-kilovolt workhorses and down into neighborhoods served via single wires strung on wooden poles.
For Southern Co., its reputation as a traditional utility heavy is a badge of pride. In 1997, it displayed a picture of a gorilla on its annual report.
Clustered around its borders are Entergy, another huge holding company that serves Louisiana, Arkansas, and parts of Mississippi and Texas; Florida Power & Light; Carolina Power & Light; Duke Power; and the federal government's centralized power giant, the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Those utilities have been under little pressure from customers to share the lines with wholesale competitors in the interest of lower prices. Prices run 15 percent or more below the national average, thanks to a rich lode of coal and natural gas and general public acceptance of the high-tension lines that carry the power generated by those fuels.
FERC, in a series of orders from 1996 to 2000, required utilities to open their wires for power shipments by independent merchants and to post how much transmission capacity they have available at any given time. The message, a former official said, was ""they couldn't use the wires to preclude others from getting their juice to market.""
But merchants say it is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of the postings made by the southeastern utilities because they operate the transmission lines as part of their closed, plant-to-customer systems.
A November 2000 FERC staff investigation of bulk power markets in the Southeast concluded that the transmission monopoly enjoyed by the region's utilities has discouraged independent power producers from siting new plants in the region.
FERC investigators cited Southern Co.'s refusal to let SkyGen Energy Inc. connect to its transmission lines in Alabama. Southern said the added load ""would cause an area-wide stability problem for electric supply.""
In that case, FERC denied SkyGen's request for relief.
Enron Vice President Kevin Presto said that day-ahead sales to customers such as municipal utilities in Southern's territory have become possible. But he said Enron has trouble getting long-term transmission commitments from Southern that would enable it to sell such power regularly. Also, he said, Enron cannot easily move power long distances through Southern's grid. ""If I tried to buy transmission across Southern Co. to Jacksonville Electric, there'd be zero available,"" Presto said.
Of the overall situation in the Southeast, he said that the utilities ""give you 0 to 5 percent of their transmission capability because they preserve the rest of it for native load [retail customers]. So you have a huge highway that's supposed to promote the free sale of electrons that isn't available to the wholesalers.""
Southern Co. Chairman Franklin dismissed as ""unfounded"" the complaints of the merchants, and officials representing Alabama and Georgia municipal utilities tied to Southern Co.'s lines say they generally have been treated well.
Robert Johnston, president of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG), which supplies power to 48 towns, took issue with the notion of a wire curtain.
""The market is growing in Georgia,"" he said. MEAG has its own trading room and has done business with a hundred or so traders or independent power producers. It also has its own generators producing power at four sites, though Southern Co. has an interest in all of them.
""There's not a grass-roots interest"" driving the reforms, Franklin said. ""It's the wholesale players.""
While it squares off against the newcomers in the Southeast, though, Southern itself has aggressively exploited the growing wholesale market. Until it was spun off as a separate company earlier this year, Mirant Corp., Southern Co.'s marketing subsidiary, competed in California, the Midwest and the North, supplementing leaner profits from Southern Co.'s regulated units.
""Southern's strategy has been clear: Compete elsewhere and run a monopoly at home,"" said Allen Mosher, director of policy analysis at the American Public Power Association.
Well Connected for Battle
The next move is up to the federal government.
Next month, Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, plans to propose legislation giving FERC expanded powers over wholesale transactions and transmission, so that ""vested interests"" will not be able to ""manipulate the use of the transmission system"" to benefit their own plants, Bingaman's office said.
In the House, key players will be Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. ""Billy"" Tauzin (R-La.), whose state is home to Southern Co.'s western neighbor, Entergy, and Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.), chairman of the energy and environment subcommittee, who has had close ties to the huge coal-dependent Texas utility TXU.
Last week, Entergy hired former FERC chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr., a Mississippi prot?g? of Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.), to handle regulatory and government affairs.
Enron recently hired a former aide to House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-Tex.), as well as a former senior spokesman in the Bush campaign, Edward Gillespie of Quinn Gillespie & Associates.
Enron officials are counting on support from House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), the hometown Houston congressman, though it is uncertain how much influence DeLay, an enthusiast for electricity deregulation, can bring to bear.
Industry lobbyists who gathered on Capitol Hill in July for closed-door meetings that DeLay sponsored, but did not attend, could not reach consensus on electricity. As a result, the energy bill passed by the House on Aug. 2 skirted key issues involving greater accessibility to the grid and electricity reliability.
Bush's election, and the fact that many utilities have plunged enthusiastically into the competitive market, clearly has created a more favorable political climate for the power merchants. Bush's first two appointees to FERC, Pat Wood III and Nora Mead Brownell, moved quickly to fix what they viewed as the Washington electricity bottleneck.
Wood had worked with Enron during a six-year effort to create a more competitive energy market in Texas, where Wood headed the state's public utility commission. Brownell, a former Pennsylvania utility regulator, won praise from Enron in 1997 when she helped block a restructuring plan that Enron contended would keep it out of the Philadelphia market.
On July 11, with a majority in tow, Wood, Brownell and William L. Massey, a Clinton appointee who is an ardent supporter of competition, tossed out proposals by Southern Co. and other utilities and directed utilities throughout the country to commence negotiations with federal mediators on handing over control of their lines to four independent regional transmission organizations, or RTOs.
""It was about time [a bomb] was dropped,"" Wood said.
But FERC's action may only have been what power association's Mosher calls the ""beginning of a long movie.""
Among those opposing expanded FERC authority are environmentalists who are fearful that new federal powers could lead to an expansion of high-voltage power lines; western property-rights advocates; and state utility regulators. Politically well-connected groups not now regulated by FERC -- including the TVA, rural electric co-ops and municipal power systems -- are also wary of new federal powers.
""There are big questions about FERC's role, who will determine transmission-line charges, should there be federal [authority] to site power lines, should there be FERC jurisdiction over power generation and reliability,"" said Rep. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), vice chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
Idaho utility regulator Marsha Smith, who heads the electricity committee for the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, noted that her state's three investor-owned utilities cannot transfer ownership or control of their transmission lines ""without our approval.""
Such approval does not seem likely anytime soon. Smith noted that 60 percent of the state's power comes from hydroelectric dams. ""That's public property,"" she said.
In Alabama, James Sullivan, a state utility regulator overseeing Southern Co.'s affiliate, said he was not happy about the way FERC was proceeding.
""I'm opposed to any [changes to] our electric system in Alabama until I know it's going to bring rates down and enhance reliability for us,"" he said.
In the view of Southern Co. Chairman Franklin, it is still an ""open question"" whether FERC has the legal authority to force utilities to surrender control of all their wires.
Nonetheless, the restructuring of the power markets may already have gone too far to ""put the genie back in the bottle,"" according to a former FERC official.
The power merchants readily concur.
""Everybody's paying too much because you've got this huge conservatism built into this bureaucratic operation of the utilities,"" Enron's Presto said.

Subject:	Jeff Huff Resume


	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  

Below are a few points for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

Subject: RE: Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

In a word - no.  ENW budgets have already been submitted to Corp as well.  There are allocations from ENW to Corp for IT Infrastructure (primarily headcount driven) and IT Maintenance and Development, and I will be reviewing these with Rick Causey.  The largest portion of our ENW costs are allocated to EA, EGM, EIM, and EES.  It is these business units primarily with whom we are meeting to share the level of detail discussed in my memo.   These business units already have in hand an allocation billing for 2002 from ENW.  Our meetings at a greater level of detail may result in some changes to the ENW budget, as business units understand more detail around the cost structures for supporting certain lines of business and certain IT development costs.  When I explained our budgeting process to Rick Causey, he had suggested that I share that with everyone on the Management Committee.  Some members are more directly impacted the the ENW budget than others.  --Sally

		Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

		The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

		We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

*	Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

*	For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

*	The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

		If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Jenny, I'm not sure you're the appropriate person with whom to address this; please let me know...

Jeff Skilling and I will no longer be Enron employees effective 9/15/01.  We have sent out letter to several hundred business associates and friends of Jeff's letting them know how to reach him; however, I suspect we missed more than a few.  I'd like to keep our phone numbers (JKS x36894 and me X35984) through the end of the year for voicemail purposes only.  I will put a greeting on which give new contact information.  In addition, I'd like to have a ""bounce back"" message on e-mail for both of us giving our new e-mail addresses; we would not necessarily need access to Enron's e-mail.  I have already activited the ""out of office assistant"" on my e-mail giving a forwarding e-mail address and instructing those with Enron business to contact Liz Taylor in Greg Whalley's office; I'll do the same for Jeff.  We'd like to have that activated through 10/31/01.

Thanks for your assistance, Jenny.  Please let me know if there is anything further I need to do to make this happen.  SRS

Subject:	RE: NOrm Coleman

It is unlikely that he will have any credible opposition in a primary.  Late last spring, there was a very well liked Republican state house member (assistant majority leader Tim Pawlenty) who was set to announce his candidacy, and the day before his announcement, Vice President Cheney called him and asked him not to run. This created a great furor in the press and the party for a short time.  Pawlenty agreed not to run, citing his desire that the party remain united so that we have a better chance of beating Wellstone. Although folks in the party were a tad miffed that Cheney was trying to be kingmaker, they ultimately want to win more than they want to put up other candidates.

Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor. Jessie Ventura, true to form, has said that he won't make up his mind until next summer!  If Ventura runs again, he has a very good chance of being re elected (he still has approval ratings in the 65-70% range).

As I mentioned earlier,  I don't believe that Wellstone will ever look at our issues in a rational or market oriented manner.  I tend to think that his votes will be just the same regardless of whether we back another candidate or not.

Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.

Subject:	RED Index shows Texas, NY, and Maine advance on retreating Pennsylvania

Note to Steven Kean

The July Update to the Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index),
published twice a year by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets
(CAEM) shows Texas, Maine, and New York are making the most measurable
strides in promoting sustainable competition among electricity providers, as
customers throughout Pennsylvania retreat to their default providers due to
increasing wholesale prices.

The RED Index, which is the only known tool that objectively ranks states by
22 attributes on how they are restructuring their power markets, today
released the U.S. rankings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia,
in a 187 page report.  Key results included:
		 1. Pennsylvania		 		 66
		 2. Texas		 		 		 65
		 3. New York		 		 		 64
		 4. Maine		 		 		 62
		 17. California		 		 		 34

""These numbers underscore the importance of building a healthy foundation on
which electric competition can grow,"" said Ken Malloy, CEO of the Center.

""While California's crisis has brought a lot of positive attention to
Pennsylvania's model, many customers in the Keystone State are returning to
their original utility suppliers.  It underscores how important it is to put
the right fundamentals in place if consumers and suppliers are to benefit
over the long haul,"" Malloy said.

In rankings that included all of North America, the province of Alberta
actually would rank above all the states with a score of 68.

The mid-year RED Index also found that 62% of states expressing an opinion
indicated that their commission is not ""less likely to take action on energy
restructuring as a result of the California crisis.""

CAEM is an independent, nonprofit, think tank based in Washington, DC whose
mission is to promote an effective transition from the monopoly to the
competitive model of regulation.

For information about obtaining a copy of the RED Index, go to www.caem.org.

For more information, please contact:
Nancy Etkin at 703-532-6887 or netkin@caem.org

If you do not wish to receive announcements from CAEM, please put ""remove""

2.  Can we make time on your schedule to meet with the Enron Europe PR team for an hour or so?  I'm sure it would be much appreciated.

Thanks, and looking forward to seeing you.

Subject: My Status


Most of you have gathered that I haven't been in the office much lately and I wanted to let you why and I am doing it via email so I don't have to say it many times.
 
I have had surgery in the interior of my mouth, specifically the lower right side of my tongue. My dentist had suspected cancer and sent me to an oral surgeon who biopsied the area.  This biopsy confirmed the dentist's opinion and off I went to MD Anderson for examination. MDA was more optimistic of diagnosis but said the area needed to be excised in any event which occured at MDA last Wednesday (the 11th). I have been at home recovering since. It has been difficult to speak although it is now much better. I will return to MDA in a month for a follow-up exam. Hopefully the excision was complete and no additional follow- up treatments will be necessary.
 
I have missed several critical meetings and just haven't ""been around"" but I wanted everyone to know that its not because I've lost interest. 
 
Thanks for patience, Rick

Subject:	DRAFT MEDIA STATEMENT RE: KLL COMPENSATION
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

Jim -- We have been getting a large number of media calls about the 14A filing, which discusses Ken Lay's change of control provision in his contract.  We would like to use the following with media -- and internal meetings with employees:

	Change of control provisions are very common at the CEO level.  Ken has had a change of control provision in his employment contract since 1989.  It enables him to trigger an involuntary termination in the event of a change of control, which includes a merger or consolidation with another corporation and Enron is not the surviving corporation.  This would have gone into effect in the event of a hostile takeover or the announced merger with Dynegy.


Please let me know ASAP if we are able to use this statement.

Thank you.
Karen

Subject:	Re: NEW DRAFT OF ENRON STATEMENT   

I know we are holding for a later filing, but I have attached further comments anyway.  The document is still too rough to send out.  We need to take the opportunity, as soon as possible, to get a hard hitting, thoroughly researched and carefully written document in front of the Commissioners.  California's reaction to the Judge's recommendation is likely to give FERC (especially the new commissioners) a feel for how irrational the California politicians can be.  We will have a limited opportunity to take advantage of that realization.  We need to hit it hard in the pleading, our conversations at the Commission, the Hill and the media.

Dear Steve,

Please find enclosed a note on the results of the Upper House election held here in Japan on July 29. 

In a nutshell, there were no real surprises. The ruling coalition achieved a comfortable majority of 12 seats, for a total of 136 seats, in the 247 seat chamber. 

I'd be happy to put together a more detailed analysis if needed.

Listing of who is owed how much in California
Listing of the forward contract holders and the relative size of their positions.
Any insights about the correlation (or lack of correlation) between the names on those lists
Listing of the defendants in the class action suits.

The objective is to identify for Brown what his leverage would be (and what benefits could be offered) if he were to convene the parties to work for a comprehensive solution.  Please let me know who will take the lead on this.

"Re: PJM RTO Order","Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, but I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to create a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle management to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmission system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual interconnections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open transmission system.

Subject:	Call to SCE Regarding Negative CTC Credits

Attorney-Client Privileged Communication

Steve, 

Rick asked me to send you an email regarding a contact with top SCE management about our Complaint against SCE for removing our ""Negative CTC Credits"" from our current bills.   While we have filed a Complaint with the CPUC and are withholding payments, the CPUC may not act until it is too late to recoup our credits (because our contracts with have expired).  As you know, there is a view among some at the CPUC that the Negative CTC Credits can only be recovered as a bill offset, and is not a cash obligation.  Therefore, SCE restoring the credits to the bills may be the only means to realize our $125 million account receivable.

Today Richard Sanders reported that Reliant, Mirant and others were soliciting Enron's participation in an involuntary filing (to be filed possibly as soon as tomorrow).  Is there any merit in contacting SCE top management and offering to trade our nonparticipation for restoration of our Negative CTC Credits to our bills?

Please call me if you wish to discuss.

Thanks.

The cost of the materials for the teacher is normally $50 but they will let Enron buy it for $35 and put it in the classes/schools of our choice (and they will put our name on the material).  We are using this curriculum at the Sidney Gutierrez Charter Middle School and it is great.

Just a short note to reiterate my efforts in  finding a company that would purchase and place the TechnoExplorers  curriculum into schools across the country as a public relations effort and sign  of good corporate citizenry in promoting education in the areas the company has  business operations.
 
I realize that only a brief overview was discussed  last evening.  I was glad to hear that Steve is considering focusing on  education.  I can put together all the necessary information that  explains the curriculum, the price, professional development training for  educators and other items of interest.  Let me know what you think.

Subject:	Draft Bank Release
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

The attached press release is the latest draft, which has been approved by Enron and one part of Citigroup.  JPMorgan is still reviewing, as is another part of Citigroup.  The release includes several bracketed phrases and sentences that are still being discussed. 

In the first paragraph, Citigroup wants to use ""including due diligence"" and delete ""final.""

In the fifth paragraph, Citigroup wants to use the phrase ""in a few days"" rather than ""shortly.""

The quote from JPMorgan may or may not be in the final release.

Once the terms of the agreement are finalized, we plan to issue this release before the opening of the market Thursday (6 a.m.).  If you have any comments or changes, please let me and Steve Kean know by email or voicemail.

Thank you.

here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
pollster for President Bush:

Gray Davis

UNFAV	       44

STRONG UNFAV     28

WRONG TRACK      49


DAVIS  		40

Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
situation politically.

Steve,

While Enron's management teams are reviewing actions plans for the upcoming six to nine months, I understand that functional transition teams will be assembled to address the planned merger.  I would like to register my strong interest in assisting any transition team where my skills could add value. Prior to developing and supporting corporate as well as enterprise systems at Enron my career has spanned across General Electric Capital Services and ABB on a global basis. Much of this experience has included system integration and change management.  

Let me know if you have any questions to the above.  Otherwise, I wanted to let you know of my interest and desire in working towards a successful transition for Enron.

Regards,

Allan Sommer

Hey gang --
 
I forgot that, after rescheduling three twice due to the events of the past month, Teresa scheduled a meeting for 9:30 this morning with our financial planner.  As a bonus, I'll bring you back his best tips for 401K manipulation in light of our present circumstances!  If I'm needed -- particularly since I sprung this one -- please feel free to call me on my vibrating cellage.  KD -- if I'm needed critically, call.  I can skip if I have to.  I'm getting ready to slam out some more A's for Mary's long list of Q's and hope to focus on that a great deal today.
 
Q: Will Enron senior management lose their bonuses, go to jail, apologize publicly, sit naked in a dunk tank at the next ECafe, donate their life savings to the United Way, and resign immediately?  Also, what happens to Starbucks?
A: Thank you for your thoughtful questions.  On the first one, our review of the situation is underway and no decisions have yet been made, but we welcome your suggestions.  On the second one, beverage service issues will be part of the transition team focus.

"RE: Ethanol","I'm not sure.  A couple of theories:  refining capacity is limited because of environmental barriers to new refinery construction;  second, in the absence of government subsidies I think ethanol is uneconomic (and with continued low crude prices and an antisubsidy mentality in Washington, it's unlikely to get better soon).
 
In other news:  Melissa's mom called last night.  Francis is dying.  He was slowly going with congestive heart failure and now has renal cancer which has spread to his liver.  He has had a great life and is well into his nineties.  He is mostly sleeping now and Norma will be getting a hospice nurse today.  Norma seems fine (this has been coming for a while), but of course no one is ever ready.  He has stayed himself to the end:  when Norma was helping him get back in bed after he had fallen, he told her:  ""I don't think we""ll be having sex today.""

Subject: Chamber update


I spoke to Allan Zaremberg, Pres. of the Cal. Chamber of Commerce.  He
met with the Governor's folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to
discuss undercollection strategies, the MOU, and direct access.  He is
not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the
Chamber's satisfaction.  The Gov's folks truly believe that the
successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even if
Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation,  Allan believes she doesn't
really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I told
him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen
agrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see
much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides.
Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that
nothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation with
Hertzberg's office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy
agenda at this time, although they have not given up.

Please see attached spreadsheet.  As you will note, energy companies are already heavily slanted to the Republican party (as are Pharmaceuticals for the most part).

Importance:	High

Good afternoon-

I have pulled the information that you requested and the attached document outlines the findings.  Per your request, the data compiled is a sampling of soft money donations for the 1998-2002 cycle for the Energy, Financial, and Pharmaceutical industries.  This was ready for you last night, but I decided to dig a little deeper and have provided additional data that you may find useful.

I looked at the specific industry for the companies that you requested and then I backed up to the ""Overview"" for the industry.

In ""The Center for Responsive Politics"" website, the ""Top Recipients"" are based on contributions from PACs, soft money donors, and individuals giving $200 or more. Due to the voluminous nature of the Top Recipients listed, I printed them out and they are available for your perusal.  On the spreadsheet, I continued the analysis on the Top Recipients and what was donated, in the election cycles 1998 - 2000, across the 3 industries.   Because you asked for a combination of Oil & Gas Companies and Electric Utilities, I showed Electric Utilities and Oil & Gas data, separately and then combined.  

Numbers that are listed in ""bold"" indicate the group who had the largest donations within each research area.  The split on the ""Top Presidential Democrat and Republican Candidates"" are calculated from the ""Overview of Sectors '98 - '00"".

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me.


 
Thanks!

Subject:	Rescheduled -- Management Conference

Ken, Greg and Mark,

I wanted to provide you a suggested agenda for the rescheduled Management Conference.  After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability, here is what we are proposing:

Location:   Westin La Cantera Resort, San Antonio (The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February.  We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation.  Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.)

Dates:   Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.  However, these are the dates that the hotel is available.  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.) 

Agenda:	

DAY 1		Friday, February 22

2pm - 5pm	Registration

6pm - 9pm	Reception and Chairman's Dinner
		Speaker:  General Norman Schwarzkopf  (The General is currently available on this date, but has not accepted the engagement.  I feel that, if we can 		reschedule him, he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities.)

DAY 2		Saturday, February 23

8am - 2pm	Business Agenda  (I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations/panel on the agenda.  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel.  Otherwise, I will		remain flexible on the agenda.)

2pm		Meeting Adjourns

		No planned activities  (The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time.)

We'd like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible.  While details on the agenda can be resolved later, please let me know if you are comfortable with the dates and location so we can include that information in the memo.

Regards,
Terrie James

Steve,

Info. from my folks (below) about not being able to access ENRON investor
website for conference call.  You might want to have someone check it out.
 

I understand from Ken's office that London has been cancelled.  I'd still
like to come down and talk to you and your folks.   Let me know when would
be a good time.

Harry, We ended not being successful in accessing the Enron web broadcast,
either live or archived. 

We could reach the page where one then clicked to enter the broadcast but
was not able to enter the broadcast itself, always getting an ERROR
message.

We tried to access both the Enron live and archived broadcasts, using 6
different computers including the web via Bloomberg, using three different
ISPs, and also three different platforms:  Windows, Windows NT and MAC. 
We also tried both RealAudio and Windows Media Player on each computer. 
We took the extra step to download the fresh versions of RealAudio and
Media Player, to make sure antiquated software was not causing our
problem. We tested the software packages on other sites, where each worked
fine.  Four C&W persons tried independently to access Enron's braodcast,
to make sure we weren't simply replicating an error on our part.  After
all this, still nothing.

Wisconsin Gas to Purchase Nine Mile Line From Northern Natural Gas

07/13/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

Line Will Enhance Competition in Southeast Wisconsin and Use Existing 
Facilities 

MILWAUKEE, July 13 /PRNewswire/ -- Wisconsin Gas, Northern Natural Gas and Guardian Pipeline announced today that Wisconsin Gas has signed an agreement with Northern Natural Gas (NNG) to purchase a nine mile, high pressure natural gas pipeline in Walworth and Waukesha counties. The purchase price is $5 million. The proposed transaction will require approval from federal and state regulators. The pipe, known as the Eagle line, is located southeast of the Kettle Moraine Forest near Eagle, Wis.
The existing line has been part of the NNG interstate transmission system. Under the new ownership, the line will become part of the Wisconsin Gas distribution system and will interconnect with Guardian Pipeline as well as the NNG system. 
""Northern Natural Gas is pleased to be a part of a creative, cost-effective solution to provide additional gas service to southeastern Wisconsin,"" said Dave Neubauer, vice president of business development and marketing, Northern Natural Gas. ""This transaction enables Wisconsin Gas and its customers to obtain natural gas supplies from Guardian or NNG. Providing reliable, economical choices for consumers will benefit all of the parties involved."" 
""We saw this as an opportunity to minimize environmental impact and still realize the benefits of increased competition in the natural gas market,"" said James Schott, senior vice president, Wisconsin Gas. ""The purchase of the Eagle line will enable Wisconsin Gas to further our goal of providing cost-efficient natural gas service to our customers."" 
As a result of the purchase Guardian Pipeline, the 141-mile interstate pipeline from Joliet, Ill. to Ixonia, Wis., will no longer build an 8.5-mile lateral to Eagle. The lateral was part of the originally certified Guardian Pipeline. This portion of the line would have generally run parallel to the current Northern Natural pipeline. 
""This sale is a win-win situation for Guardian and consumers,"" said George Hass, project manager of Guardian Pipeline. ""The Eagle line purchase by Wisconsin Gas saves Guardian time and resources by taking away the need to build the 8.5-mile lateral and allows all three companies to create a better environment for competition in the natural gas marketplace."" 
The existing gate stations at LaGrange and Eagle will remain in-service for regulation purposes. Odorization and measurement will take place at a new gate station that will be constructed at the interconnect with Guardian. This new gate station will be called the Bluff Creek station and will be located near Whitewater. The Bluff Creek gate station will be constructed during the construction of Guardian Pipeline. 
Northern Natural Gas, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., with a market area capacity of about 4.3 Bcf/d, provides natural gas transportation services to utility customers in the upper Midwestern United States through its approximately 16,000 miles of pipeline. 
Guardian Pipeline is a partnership of three Midwestern energy companies: CMS Energy, based in Dearborn, Mich.; Wisconsin Energy, headquartered in Milwaukee, Wis.; and Viking Gas Transmission Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., and located in St. Paul, Minn. 
Wisconsin Electric-Wisconsin Gas, the principal utility subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy Corp. (NYSE: WEC), serves more than one million electric customers and more than 960,000 natural gas customers throughout Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

Commodities Review: LME Copper Hit By Another Stock Rise
By Mark Long and Steve McGrath
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures traded in London fell Friday, as a further influx of stocks into official warehouses put the copper market under pressure and dragged down the rest of the base metal complex. 
Three-month copper traded on the London Metal Exchange ended $6 down from Thursday's late kerb close at $1,554.50 a metric ton.
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper into LME warehouses Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support, although prices recovered slightly in later trade. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation. The July futures contract will switch over to cash Monday. 
Enron declined to comment on the market talk Friday. 
A backwardation is a pricing structure in which deliveries to be made in the near future are more expensive then those set for a more distant delivery. The opposite situation is called contango. 
""The spreads are still tight. The major longs are still reluctant to lend, with no signs of that (tightness) dissipated,"" said Kevin Norrish, an analyst with Barclays Capital in London. 
Dealers and analysts said they expect further stock increases next week. 
The entire base metals complex ignored Thursday's 237-point rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, dealers said. 
""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,"" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. 
European Grain Futures See Profit-Taking, But More Gains Expected 
European grain and oilseed futures were hit by a bout of profit-taking and pre-weekend position-squaring Friday, after rising to long-time highs, brokers said. 
However, world and domestic crop concerns, the strength of the dollar and general bullish sentiment will carry the markets to fresh highs short term, they said. 
On the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange, the benchmark November feed wheat contract ended just 25 pence up at GBP82/ton, after hitting a new two-year high of GBP83/ton in early trade. 
Meanwhile, Matif November rapeseed futures fell EUR2.75 on the day to EUR265/ton, after hitting a three-year high of EUR271/ton in early trade. 
The U.K. wheat crop and the French rapeseed crop are forecast to be well down on last year, and wheat and canola crops in some other major producing countries are also expected to fall. 
Meanwhile, the strength of the dollar is allowing European grain and oilseed traders to up prices and still remain competitive against U.S. imports and dollar-denominated grains on the world market.

LME Base Metals: Copper Pressured Down By Stock Build

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month copper ended Friday's late kerb lower compared with Thursday, pressured by another stock build, dealers said. 
(LME three-month metals prices in dollars a metric ton at 1600 GMT, with the previous late kerb close in parentheses. Comex copper at 1641 GMT in cents a pound, with the previous close in parentheses.) Copper 1,554.50 (1,560.50) Tin 4,452.50 (4,502.50) 
Aluminum 1,452.25 (1,458.50) Zinc 871.50 (877.50) 
Nickel 5,925.00 (6,012.50) Lead 462.50 (465.00) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.75 (70.80)
An increase of 7,475 tons of copper Friday brought total stocks up to a 12-month high of 550,300 tons. This pressured prices in early trade down to test $1,550/ton support before rising slightly to close at $1,554.50/ton, down from Thursday's close of $1,560.50/ton. 
Unconfirmed market talk said Enron is behind much of the week's stock rise, in an effort to ease nearby supply tightness and to alleviate the large short positions it is thought to have built up on the July-for-a-week spread, which is currently showing a $6-$8/ton backwardation.

""Copper has been sensitive to moves in the stock market, but not this time,"" Norrish said. In fact, now it appears that base metals markets ignore equities markets when they rally, but follow stocks down when they slump, he added. 
Aluminum also ended the late kerb lower Friday. 
News of the restart of some smelters has dampened sentiment, despite a stock drawdown of around 8,000 tons since the end of last week, dealers said. 
""The stock drawdowns are fairly small percentage-wise,"" said Standard Bank analyst Robin Bhar, adding that they would need to be much larger to significantly improve market sentiment. 
""A test of $1,435/ton cannot be ruled out, though we would expect forward buying to prevent a break below this level for the time being,"" Barclays said in a market report. 
Zinc continued its slump, falling to a seven-and-a-half-year low, mainly on technicals. 
Technicals also hurt nickel, which rose slightly after breaking $5,900/ton support but still closed at its lowest level since April. 
Nickel's fall was ""just on some speculative liquidation and short selling, mostly chart-based,"" Bhar said.

UK: Telecoms, drugs drive FTSE 100 rally, Vodafone leads.
By Camila Reed

07/13/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, July 13 (Reuters) - Britain's largest companies raced higher at the close on Friday fired by telecoms and drug stocks as they bounced back from Wednesday's 16-week low. 
Index heavyweights Vodafone and GlaxoSmithKline provided 27 of the day's 55-point gain, while technology firms wobbled. However, the telecoms giant surged 4.1 percent to 157-1/4p.
The FTSE 100 finished 55.4 points or one percent firmer at 5,537.0, having jumped 1.66 percent on Thursday after seven consecutive losing sessions, with gainers outnumbering losers by three to one. 
Stocks steamed higher and refused to be derailed by sluggish U.S. retail sales figures for June, which showed only a meagre rise, and a weaker Wall Street, but volumes were thin at 1.4 billion shares. 
By London's 1530 GMT finish the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average was down five points, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index was flat, having streaked up in the previous session. 
Mike Lenhoff and Simon Rubinsohn at money managers Gerrard said that the UK equity market was deeply oversold and long-term this presented a buying opportunity for UK equities. 
DRUGS SEE-SAW 
Drugs reversed an earlier decline with Nycomed Amersham among the day's top performers, up nearly four percent at 536-1/2p and AstraZeneca rising over one percent. 
Mining giant Anglo American moved into the FTSE 100 top ten gainers with a three percent rise, as investors sought refuge in mining stocks as a cyclical play. 
Another major gainer was British business services firm Hays Plc up 3.4 percent. The shares leapt on market talk that Germany's Deutsche Post was looking to make a bid for it, dealers said. 
Both Deutsche Post and Hays declined to comment. 
Firmer crude prices gave support to the oil sector. BP rose 0.6 percent to 572 pence and Shell also added 0.6 percent to 581-1/2p lifting the index by four points. 
FTSE MIXED PICTURE 
But dealers and analysts said it would be a mixed picture going forward with the market scrutinising data for signs of a sustained economic recovery or a lapse in consumer confidence. 
""This week we had a really bloody day on Wednesday and then the opposite on Thursday, so we're going to be on a rollercoaster still. It's very fragile but it does show the potential of the market,"" said Foreign & Colonial director of UK equities David Manning. 
""It's not only the holiday period, it's also that the market can make you look an idiot one day to the next. In that sort of circumstance the temptation is to do very little,"" he said. 
ABN Amro strategist Gareth Williams said the market would make modest progress over the next month or so, with moves downward quite likely although the trend would be upwards over the course of the year. 
TECHS DIP 
Thursday's 5.3-percent rally in the Nasdaq failed to bring any cheer to UK technology shares. Logica and Colt Telecom slid four percent, while microchip designer ARM fell 3.9 percent to 223 pence trimming Thursday's 13 percent jump. 
The techMARK index of technology shares rose 0.98 percent to 1,602.87. 
Elsewhere on the downside, UK holiday operator Airtours lost nearly 10 percent of its value after Swiss peer Kuoni issued a profit warning. 
Among second liners, Baltimore Technologies closed up 3.3 percent. It initially rallied 22 percent after the Irish Internet security firm said it received an approach from an unlisted British-based company for an all-paper deal to combine the companies. 
The FTSE 250 Mid-cap index finished 5.1 points stronger at 6,163.8. 
Among small-caps, Paladin Resources' shares jumped 10 percent after the UK oil explorer said that major shareholder U.S. oil giant Enron had sold the whole of its 40-million-share stake via HSBC bank for 44 pence a share. 
Britain's Litho Supplies Plc slumped 42.5 percent after the company, which supplies printing and graphic arts products, said that sales in the first six months of 2001 were on target, but profits would likely be below expectations due to tough market conditions and pressure on margins.

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)
2001-07-13 08:48 (New York)

Futures Contract Covering Coal Debuts in New York (Correct)

     (Corrects location of FirstEnergy Corp. in 10th paragraph of
story that moved yesterday.)

     New York, July 12 (Bloomberg) -- The New York Mercantile
Exchange today began trading a futures contract for low-sulfur
coal, a fuel that President George W. Bush said will play a major
role in meeting electricity demand over the next two decades.
     The contract's debut came after prices for coal, considered
the dirtiest of power-plant fuels, doubled in the past year, as
demand from power plants outstripped mine production. Coal for
September delivery opened at $42 a ton and settled at $40.75, as
98 contracts were traded, exchange officials said.
     ``We had a big run-up in coal prices this past winter,'' said
Andy Ozley, who buys coal for Atlanta-based Mirant Corp.'s six
coal plants in New York, Illinois, Maryland and Virginia. ``This
contract affords us a way to mitigate our exposure'' to large
price swings.
     The Bush administration said in an energy policy report this
spring that coal would be the dominant fuel for electricity
generation through 2020. Bush gave an added boost to the fuel when
he retreated from a campaign pledge to restrict carbon dioxide
emissions, implicated in global warming.
     Coal plants are responsible for a third of the nation's
carbon dioxide emissions. They also produce sulfur dioxide, which
causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog.
     The Nymex started the futures contract to give mining
companies and utilities a way to hedge their risks in the $33
billion coal market. Producers such as Peabody Energy Corp. and
Arch Coal Inc., whose shares have soared in the past year, have
said they would trade the futures.

                            New Plants

     Last year's quadrupling of prices for natural gas -- a
cleaner-burning power-plant fuel -- prompted many generators to
ramp up output from their coal plants. Utility coal stockpiles
dwindled, and prices have risen to their highest levels since at
least 1989.
     So far this year, more than a dozen companies have announced
plans to build coal-fired plants, including Kansas City, Missouri-
based Kansas City Power & Light Co. and Portland, Oregon-based
PacifiCorp.
     Although coal is used to produce 52 percent of the nation's
electricity, few plants were built during the 1990s because of the
high costs of building them and the difficulty of complying with
federal and local environmental regulations.
     Demand for coal has eased in recent weeks as below-normal
temperatures in the U.S. Midwest and Northeast reduced demand for
air conditioning, said Jim Parks, who buys coal for six power
plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania as director of fuels at Akron,
Ohio-based FirstEnergy Corp.
     ``The summer's been pretty mild so far -- you haven't seen
any big heat waves'' in regions with the most coal generation, he
said.

                           Big Sandy

     The Nymex futures contract calls for the delivery of 1,550
tons of low-sulfur coal to the mouth of the Big Sandy River near
Huntington, West Virginia. From there, the fuel would be loaded
onto Ohio River barges and shipped to power plants in the U.S. and
possibly Europe.
     The new contract is tailored to producers in Appalachian
states that account for about 40 percent of U.S. production,
including West Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania, the No. 2, 3
and 4 coal producers.
     The industry lacks a futures contract for coal from Western
states that account for 47 percent of the nation's production,
including the No. 1 producer, Wyoming.

                         Avoiding the Past

     The exchange, which earns commissions on trades, hopes coal
futures will avoid the fate of other contracts it has started over
the past few years. Its six electricity futures contracts have
fizzled, as has its Middle East sour crude oil contract, which
debuted in May 2000.
     ``I said yesterday, if you traded 100 to 200 contracts, that
would be a really a good day,'' said Chris Casale, vice president
of energy trading at Dynegy Inc. in Houston, which trades coal and
buys the fuel for its six power plants in New York and Illinois.
``It came out sort of on target.''
     Most of today's trading was originated by large energy
marketing companies, he said, although he declined to say whether
Dynegy traded any contracts. Enron Corp., the largest energy
trader, and Duke Energy Corp., the largest U.S.-based utility
holding company, have said they would trade coal futures.
     Exchange officials have said the coal market has the
potential to reach 5,000 trades a day after a year of trading.
     The Nymex's 17-year-old crude oil futures contract averages
about 66,700 trades a day, and its 11-year-old natural gas
contract averages about 33,500.

                           Wary of Coal

     ``The coal market is still lacking liquidity,'' said Anthony
McAuley, a floor broker at ABN Amro Inc., who said he bought five
coal contracts for a client at $42 a ton -- the market's first
transaction. ``You probably need to see a little more
participation'' from industry coal buyers and sellers for the
market to take off.
     Independent floor traders, known as locals, are wary of
trading coal futures without assurances that the industry will be
active as well.
     ``Floor traders lost millions'' in electricity futures when
some were caught with high-priced contracts and nobody in the
industry to sell them to, he said.
     ``Because of that, people are a little bit tentative about
coal,'' said Tom Schiff, an independent crude oil trader. ``We're
here to help make liquidity but we can't tackle all the risk.''







			
			
		 Modern Metals, July 2001    Giant energy concern now turns its attention to steel. The company's aggressive posture has begged controversy. Industry reactions vary from hand-wringing to open arms. Still others characterize Enron as a ""non-event."" By Michelle Martinez Arjona, Editor-in-Chief, and Paul Hohl, Contributing Editor  These days, saying the word ""Enron"" in a room full of metals executives is like screaming ""fire"" in a crowded theater. For most in the steel industry, the idea of a futures market is enough to raise a few eyebrows. But when a major market maker with annual revenues of 10 times the market cap of the U.S. steelmaking industry stakes a claim (for 2000 alone, Enron logged revenues of $101 billion--that's with a ""b""), a lot more than eyebrows are likely to be raised. After a bold presentation from Jeff McMahon, president and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets, at the SSCI annual convention in May (in which he accused steel mills of treating their service center customers as ""annoyances""), industry leaders rushed to understand this latest market contender.  Friend or foe? Competitor or partner? These are just a couple of the questions surrounding Enron's aggressive push into the metals industry. Judging from the service center and mill executives Modern Metals queried, there are as many answers as there are opinions in the industry. Reactions ranged from fear to acceptance to downright resentment. At least one mill was reticent to discuss Enron at all--still others seemed to meet the issue with unaffected shrugs. If the saying is true that all publicity is good publicity, the buzz that Enron has generated would make even a Hollywood spin doctor envious. What's the hubbub? Although products such as natural gas and energy--Enron's major business platform--have been traded as commodities for years, until Enron's appearance a formal forward market for steel has never existed. According to McMahon, the absence of a liquid and transparent market has resulted in ""uninformed investment decisions"" that have exacerbated the current oversupply situation, and left companies exposed to the hazards of price volatility.  Enron's answer is to offer a variety of financial hedging products along with forward contracts in hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized (plate and long products are soon to follow), locking in prices for as many as five years out. Enron contends that it can act as a ""risk intermediary"" in steel transactions, ensuring healthier profit margins and lowering the cost of capital. Certain grades of steel are commodities, McMahon insists, and as such should be bought and sold on a commodity market basis, instead of the strategic relationships that now exist between the mills and consumers. Enron has been offering steel online, and via phone and fax, since November of last year. ""Before you add capacity, before you make an investment decision, you'll be able to see a three, five, maybe even a 10-year forward price of steel,"" McMahon stated, ""and if you want to hedge that investment you can do that."" The company plans to buy steel at a floating price and then sell it to steel consumers at a fixed rate, making money on the spread. In February, Greg Hermans, VP of steel trading at Enron, reported to AMM that it was offering U.S.-made 10-gauge, 48-in. wide hot-rolled for April delivery in Chicago for $225 a ton. Hermans said Enron was buying the same product for April delivery at $215 a ton.  Eventually, Enron sees the development of four different marketplaces: the Northeast, the Midwest (or Chicago area), the Gulf Coast (or Houston area), and the West Coast. Enron will hedge against spot price spikes through equity and physical holdings in domestic mills. The company closed on Huntco's Arkansas-based cold-rolling mill in June. ""It's a big portfolio,"" McMahon said. ""We wanted to put together a portfolio of supply and demand. In some cases, we'll own assets--hopefully we'll own some term contracts with domestic mills. To the extent that imports are a part of the equation, we'll be a part of that market. We may purchase capacity from somebody, not necessarily the assets, but toll slab through a hot strip mill. All of those combined is how we do our business."" Steel mills can benefit, McMahon said, by entering into a multi-year ""physical off take"" with Enron, thus giving steel mills a degree of certain volume and on product specification. Enron would guarantee purchase of a specified amount of tonnage, and use a floating price or a floor price to guard against market shocks. Whether mills would be willing to divert capacity to the commodity grades being bought and sold by Enron remains uncertain. At least one mill executive privately said no . . . at least for now. Nucor president, CEO and vice chairman, Dan DiMicco also sees little value in Enron's proposal. ""What we need to have is stable pricing at levels where the most efficient mills can make a good return on their capital and further invest in new technologies and equipment,"" he stated. ""I define true value as helping the industry to become stronger. It doesn't do any good to maintain a lack of price volatility at $200 a ton."" Keith Busse, CEO at Steel Dynamics, echoed that sentiment in a recent New Steel article. ""If you're trying to get volatility out at $320 [per ton], great,"" he said. ""But at $230, you want to stick your fingers down your throat."" For the service centers Service centers, McMahon suggested, could benefit immediately. ""The only way [distributors] are able to hedge themselves is to go out and buy inventory,"" he explained. ""That takes capital, and cash, and space. We can offer a financial product that gives the exact same protection, but doesn't require any of the above. ""We can hold those inventories and price the steel at the time of delivery to the service centers,"" he continued, ""so their 4- or 5- percent net margins are somewhat certain."" ""I do think that Enron is providing a service for the industry . . . "" commented Dave Lerman, CEO of Steel Warehouse, South Bend, Indiana. But he pointed out that ""how [it] moves forward will be interesting. If they just move forward with hedge instruments . . . that's independent of whether you run your business well by having a good supplier that matches up with the demands of your customers. I think [Enron] will be a good thing for some people and a non-event for others."" Beyond hedging, McMahon pointed out, firm and enforceable contracts could become a key benefit to service centers. As one Midwestern distributor source commented, ""One of the terrible things that happens in our business is that end users demand long-term pricing, beyond what anybody can foresee. When they anticipate the market is going up, or that it has hit a low point, they push harder for it--as any one would. But historically, they don't honor the deals.""  In a down market, he explained, customers demand lower prices. Noncompliance can result in orders, but no releases, and a ""don't call us, we'll call you"" attitude from customers. The consequence for service centers, he said, are price reductions on the way down and on the way up. ""If Enron brings integrity to both sides of this market,"" he concluded, ""that would be a very big plus for the steel industry."" But integrity, another Midwest service center exec countered, has got nothing to do with it. In his estimation, Enron is like a profiteering carpetbagger, ""trying to make a buck in between the producer and the user. That's all we need right now,"" he declared, ""somebody trying to squeeze out a few more dollars."" But, he recognized, ""we're all going to have to deal with it."" Don McNeeley, president and CEO of Chicago Tube & Iron, indicated that some good could come of a heavy-hitter like Enron introducing new ideas into the industry, but acknowledged that people might be offended by somebody picking the so-called ""low-hanging fruit"" of the steel market in the current economy. ""What do you think the mills are going to do when you come to them for just the peripheral items?"" he queried. ""My concern would be that the price would go up on [those items]."" McNeeley also questioned the wisdom of distributors relinquishing control of their inventories. ""In distribution, 60 percent of our net worth is inventory, 30 percent is accounts receivable, and 10 percent is plant property and equipment,"" he related. ""Our single largest asset is our inventory. If a distribution company surrenders control of its inventory to a third party, does not that distributor, in effect, surrender its own sovereignty?"" Only just begun Questions abound regarding Enron's role as a physical supplier of steel as well. As one Minnesota-based service center exec put it, ""are they ready to deal with problems?"" Although Enron has expressed interest in being a physical supplier, Dave Lerman explained, ""I think that's going to be a lot more difficult to implement."" Enron would have to consider specific qualities, coil sizes, nuances of chemistry, surface quality, and formability. ""Most customers require better than standard tolerances,"" he pointed out. ""These are all issues that might complicate commodity sales."" Delivery is another issue. As a physical supplier, Enron has virtually guaranteed just-in-time delivery, but as one service center source said, ""the guarantee is good when the material shows up at my door. What happens if it doesn't show up? I disappoint a customer. What good does it do to sue [Enron] if I've lost a customer?"" Mill executives have questioned whether Enron is a potential competitor. ""They see Enron as someone likely to buy foreign steel in order to deliver it to a U.S. customer,"" said Chuck Bradford, principal of Bradford Research and a long-time industry observer. He cautioned against seeing Enron as too much of a physical supplier, speculating that the future of Enron, similar to the LME, will be in hedging. ""You may see some [physical transactions] to start with,"" Bradford predicted, ""just to get the ball rolling. But I don't see that as the way the market will develop."" McMahon has been consistent in saying that Enron has little interest in becoming a steel manufacturer. The real value, he said, is in a transparent, liquid market. ""We know the products work, we know the market wants them. Can any one particular mill or mills prevent that? We don't think so,"" he said. ""It's not an 'if', it's a 'when'."" The jury is still out on just how soon that ""when"" will come, and what those effects will be for the steel industry. And for all of the debate surrounding the issue, it seems a bit soon to be hitting the panic button. As Don McNeeley recounted, ""I can recall similar controversy over a speech a guy gave about 15-17 years ago. That guy's name was Ken Iverson, and he had this concept called a mini-mill. Look at it now.""

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Paul

Dear Steve:

As per your voicemail, I have reviewed the agreements between Enron Corp. and Kissinger Associates, Inc. and Enron Corp. and McLarty International, LLC.

I agree with your assessment that Enron can not legally terminate the agreement with Kissinger Associates, Inc. until May 20, 2002.

I also agree that we can terminate the relationship with McLarty International, LLC upon thirty days written notice.

Thus I have prepared two letters:
	
	1.  Letter from you to Mr. McLarty advising of Enron's termination of the Agreement effective November 21, 2001.  It needs to be sent tomorrow, November 21, 2001. 

	2.  Letter from Mr. Lay to Ambassador Paul Bremer advising of Enron's termination of the Agreement effective May 20, 2002.

I have tried to soften our standard notice.  Please revise each letter as necessary.  As per your voicemail, I will be happy to ""tickle"" the  letter to Ambassador Bremer until April, 2002.  However, I did not find any language in the Agreement which would prevent us from providing notice of termination at this time.

Thank you.

Jeff - 

Here is cash flow on new building, as requested.  Some notes:  

The $218.7 mill. Base Building and Trading Floor Tenant Improvements (i.e. 2nd floor Cafeteria, Trading floors 3-6, 7th floor Executive, and Computer floors 8 and 9) is work in progress, over 80% complete and paid to date.  Not much we can do here except suffer the anger of contractor and hold retainage as long as possible ($14 mill. payment in May '02).  We are contractually obligated to make draw payments on the 5th of each month ($4.785 mill. to be paid next week).

Presently we are gearing up spend ($28 mill.) on Tower Tenant Improvements (interiors of floors 10 thru 40).  This is deferrable, either partially or in full, if we re-think our strategy on who, when, how many move to new tower.

I'll be out of office rest of week but reachable.  Thanks - Bill

Subject: Feedback on resignation


Dear Mr. Lay,
 
I submitted my resignation Wednesday, the fifthteenth of this month. My resignation is somewhat reluctant, as I've always received excellent reviews and even won an EES Power Player award. My experiences at Enron prior to the last few months has been very positive. I've learned a lot and have made many friends.
 
Your presentation at the all-employee meeting inspired me to share some important thoughts with you. I hope that my input will ultimately make Enron a better place. My employment began with EES, where I worked with the Facilities team. I enjoyed the fast pace and high profile nature of the job. I felt very successful and satisfied. After working with EES for a little over a year, I transfered to EBS to work with their facilities team. Again, I experienced a great deal of success and received frequent positive feedback.
 
With the EBS reorganization, all facilities activities and personnel were absorbed into EPSC led by Bill Donovan. I never had the opportunity to meet him. However, my direct supervisor was Janelle Duree. I was initially very excited about the move to Corp; I knew that Enron was very supportive of employee education, training and growth opportunities. I was convinced that I would be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that the company offered me, such as partial reimbursement for my Masters Degree (I currently hold a BBA in Accounting and Computer Information Systems). I was also very excited to take courses such as AutoCad, that would make me more valuable to the facilities team and allow my career to advance. Both of these opportunities were made clear to me under my previous supervisors. In fact I had already enrolled in an AutoCad course when I transferred to Corp.
 
What happened next, and continued over the next couple of months is simply unbelievable considering Enron's stated Values and Vision, not to mention the corporate culture we're all so proud of.
 
I was informed by my new supervisor that a Masters Degree was in no way necessary to perform the duties assigned to me. When I asked about setting my goals and discussing career paths, I was told that that wouldn't be necessary; I had reached the top... there was no place for me to go from here. When I asked how PRC was handled, my supervisor told me that I would be evaluated according to my communication and organizational skills---that would be all that I'd need to succeed in the environment. I was also told to cancel the AutoCad course; it was also unnecessary. In effect, I was told to lower my expectations. I still find this attitude completely unacceptable!
 
If this wasn't bad enough, a month later, I was told that I was no longer a Specialist--- I was now a Customer Service Rerpresentative and as such would be paid by the hour. It is clear that in an environment like Enron, this signaled a tremendous setback for my career. I was demoted although by all accounts I've been an invaluable asset to each group that I've worked with. In fact, all the managers that had been brought to Corp from other groups were also demoted--- their peer groups were changed to reflect Senior Specialist levels. When we complained to HR, we were told that they were completely within their rights, and that the decision was final.  Unfortunately, it was clear that the only means by which I could give my career a fighting chance was to look outside of Enron.
 
The good news is that I did find an opportunity. I have been promoted to the equivalent of a Senior Specialist. The bad news is that the company is not Enron. I really don't like the idea of leaving Enron, but I feel like I was left without a choice. What concerns me the most is that Enron's greatest asset has always been its people. If this is really true, then it's a huge shame your are rapidly losing the most important resource you have.
 
As I mentioned earlier, I am writing you because I truly feel you care about Enron's continued growth and success. I think you need to know what is happening in the organization, and the sort of impact it has on your personnel.
 
Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
 
Respectfully submitted,
 
Debbie Suchoff

In response to the possibility of terrorist actions in retaliation for ongoing U.S. military operations against sites in Afghanistan, federal authorities have taken the following actions:

1) DOE has increased its security condition from SECON-3 to SECON-2.  Per DOE, SECON-2 ""is set when a terrorist incident occurs or intelligence information is received indicating that some form of terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection measures to be put in place.""
2) NERC has gone to its highest threat level, Threat Level 3.
3) DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety has opened its Crisis Management Center.

In addition, the Energy Security Council, while noting that no specific threats against any infrastructure have been been identified, today urged participants to maintain the highest levels of vigilance and evaluate whether additional security measures were warranted.

Subject:	Meeting with Dan Larcamp/ Marketing Affiliate Rulemaking


Leslie Lawner, Becky Cantrell and I met with Dan Larcamp at FERC yesterday to discuss the marketing affiliate issue.  He agreed with the latest press reports that the upcoming rulemaking NOPR, expected to be voted out in September, would not make major structural changes to the industry.  The current document is up to the Commission level and the Commissioners are clearly considering the alternatives now.  Larcamp said he expected a broadening of the current market affiliate rules structure to include all corporate entities.  He did specifically mention that the Commission is not comfortable with the link between financial and physical transactions and the possibility for manipulation of market prices in one market (financial) to affect prices in the other market (physical).  He also expects the Commission to blend the gas and power rules, using the best practices of each.  Any NOPR that is issued will of course have comment dates to allow Enron and all industry participants to comment on any proposed rule changes.

Larcamp indicated that he did not think there were pervasive afilliate discrimination issues in the industry, but said that the Commission needed to act due to the political pressures they got from the Hill, etc.  The El Paso case is top on everyone's mind and is of special concern because it affects the California market, both gas and power. 

Larcamp indicated that he is just now learning what a ""Pat Wood"" Commission is going to want.  He indicated that Wood has closer ties to the producer community than either of the two former Chairmen.  He therefore expects  that the Commission will be responsive to that sector in taking a relook at the affiliate rules.  However, Larcamp did mention that the only meeting that he had previously had on the affiliate issue was with the INGAA group (Joe Hartsoe went with them).  It is not clear whether the producer community has lobbied this issue at the Commissioner level.

We discussed strategy with Dan, how to let the Commission feel more comfortable with the marketing affiliate issue.  He suggested that he had gained a lot by visiting the trading floors (including Enron's).  He thought the Commissioners and their immediate staffs would benefit from similar visits.  

We specifically raised the issue of market prices, and talked about tranportation costs not equalling basis differentials.  We stated that our marketers believed that the prices in the market were determined by market factors in the specific areas of delivery rather than basin costs plus transport costs.  Dan did indicate some agreement with this concept and thought that more education at the Commissioner level would be very worthwhile.

If you have any questions, call Leslie, Becky or me.

Steve and Karen,

Here is the latest draft of the Lay It On the Line memo from Ken.  Cindy made some signficant changes this morning.  Some of the action items removed were mandatory vacation, leadership training, online communications training, the function of Employee Relations and the employee task force.   Mary and I agree that, as it stands now, there is not nearly enough ""meat"" to warrant a communication to employees.  Sending out a memo with a ""theoretical"" approach and few significant, tangible action items will backfire.  As an FYI, I was told by several people, including one in HR, that employees are reacting very sensitively to any changes that are announced.  I think we should wait to communicate this until we have solid, positive action items.

Hi Karen:

Sue did a great job today at the VICA meeting.  I wish I could take Sue and
fellow speaker Fred Pickle up and down the State of California to talk to
business associations about energy.

The audience was very receptive to the presentation.  Now that the energy
crisis has moved off the front page and the legislature is out of session,
people seem better able to absorb the magnitude and long-term ramifications
of long term contracts, the end of direct access, etc.

David Horowitz spent more time talking about telco deregulation than
electricity.  He is clearly more comfortable talking about telco and was
completely unaware of current events at Enron.  David Freeman did not show
up and he didn't send anyone in his place.

Carolyn Casavan, VICA co-chair of the energy & environment committee told
Sue to call if there was anything that VICA could do to support efforts to
reinstate direct access to please call.

Hope you have a good weekend.

Talk to you soon

Steve

Here are a few thoughts on the management committee meeting at the Woodlands:

I would stay away from a general reporting on what is happening if at all possible - and focus
on a few things we really need to work on as well as a few things we should remind ourselves
are going quite well.  If we only focus on the problems I fear the group will walk away a bit
demoralized.

Second - I think we should move to many things getting driven by subcommittees of the
Management committee.  And then the recommendations sometimes being approved
by the Management committee.

Here are a few subjects that we should touch on and initiate debate but not try and
solve - get them started and turn over to a subcommittee:
PRC process
Diversity
Giving the right signal to our business about the value and cost of capital
What new businesses do we have going?
Is now the right time for Xcelerator?
More detailed external financial reporting
How do we describe ourselves to the outside world and inside world?  What messages
  do we want to modify?
What are the characteristics where our business model works and doesn't work?
How well is our RAC process really working?
We are a business where our biggest cost is people and that cost has blown out
  during the last few years - do we need to think about our biggest cost any
  differently than we did five years ago?
How challenged are we really in getting substantial credit for Enron now that it 
our credit spreads.
Enron's normal new business mindset has been to overwhelm an opportunity - EBS, EES,
power.  When this works it really pays off but in today's financial markets is a more conservative
approach warranted?

Anyway those are just a few ideas.  One of the things we might do tomorrow is solicit 
ideas from the entire committee (in writing) and work on those items of most interest.

John

Below (and in the attached in Word format) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Just wanted to pass this along.  It's good to know he is alright.

With someone like Mr. Foster so nervous about air travel, do we need to consider alternative travel options for our VPs?  I'm assuming a lot more will chose to drive from Houston to San Antonio -- I know I will this year.  The idea of chartered buses from Houston to San Antonio surfaced, but I expect most who opt to drive will want control of the time they leave and return to Houston and arrange a small carpool.  What are your thoughts?

Terrie, a warm thx to you.  We are, thank God, all OK here, both family and
friends.  Friends of friends were badly hit however, and that hurts all of
us.  NYC is a different place today than a little more than a week ago.

As long as you are sending the plane I am coming.  Frankly, without the
plane it would be a tough decision to make.  I find that most meetings
requiring travel these days are getting canceled.  It is one thing for an
individual to fly, it is another thing for an a father or mother to leave
spouse and children at home.   That is very hard to justify at this point.

Thanks for your concern and kindness.

Dick

Subject:	McCain, Lieberman Urge GHG Reductions - White House to ""Likely"" Offer Alternative by COP-7

Before leaving for the August congressional recess, Senator John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) made a joint statement on the Senate floor calling for an economy-wide cap and trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Please see the attached copy of their floor statements.
They laid out a timeframe for consultation with stakeholders, including U.S. industry, and development of legislation this fall.
This follows a series of legislative activity in the Senate since the conclusion of the international climate change negotiations in Bonn, Germany in July.  At the talks, without the support and direct participation of the U.S., nations agreed to continue to develop the rules for the Kyoto Protocol with a target date for ratification by 2002.
Other Senate activity includes:
Committee approval of climate change legislation sponsored by Senator Robert Byrd (D-W.Virginia) and Senator Ted Stevens (R-AL).  The bill would require development of a U.S. climate change response strategy with a long-term goal of stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S.  The strategy would seek ways to mitigate emissions and promote technology innovation, climate adaptation research and efforts to resolve scientific and economic uncertainties.  It would authorize spending of $4.9 billion over 10 years.
Passage of a non-binding resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations committee calling for the U.S. to engage in the climate change negotiations.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AL), Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) and others that provide for tax incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy technologies, increased research on climate science and government coordination on climate change.
Introduction of legislation by Senator Sam Brownback (R-KS) and Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to enable reporting and provide credit for land management and sequestration under a national climate change program. 
Upcoming Administration and Congressional Activity
Despite statements made last week by EPA Administrator Christine Whitman and National Security Advisory Condolezza Rice, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card said yesterday that the Bush Administration would likely have an alternative climate change proposal for consideration at the next negotiations in Morocco in late-October.  
A key issue remains whether the Bush Administration will support mandatory programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, like a domestic cap and trade system.  In March, President Bush said he would not support mandatory regulation of carbon dioxide emissions at power plants.  As recent events suggest, consideration of mandatory programs and emissions trading, including regulation of carbon, will be on the Senate agenda this fall.   Approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be considered through hearings and committee consideration of climate change legislation, multipollutant proposals and New Source Review reform.  
Enron's Advocacy
Enron will continue to promote its multipollutant proposal as a model for a domestic cap and trade program -- that could also provide a framework to address carbon emissions.  We will also offer our expertise on emissions trading and risk management to the Administration and Congress as they consider options to address climate change.
I will keep you posted on the status and movement on these legislative proposals.  Please feel free to contact me with questions about any of these proposals.

We have extended the campaign for three more days!

As of this morning, we are at 91.69% of our goal and 70% participation.  The 70% participation rate includes those who have completed the on-line pledge process, but may not have contributed (427 out of 4,655 have chosen not to contribute).  The contribution rate is 64%.  We also have a total of 56 Alexis de Tocqueville members which surpasses last year's total of 49.  Out of those 56, 19 are new members!  The next three days are crucial to exceeding our $2.9M goal.  Thanks for all that you can do to help make this happen.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Kathy

Subject:	Transatlantic meetings

To the Executive Committee:

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

     Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
     Some  of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
     personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
     be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday
     activities.   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
     to  increase  your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize
     disruption to our day-to-day business.

     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp.  Security  resides  in  our
     business  controls  organization.   You  can contact this organization
     through  their  website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>),  by phone
     (713-345-2804),     or     by    email    (CorporateSecurity@enron.com

     Business  Controls,  leads  this  organization.   Please  feel free to
     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions, or to
     report security threats.

     We  have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel
     advisory.

     Access to the Enron Center

     Over  the  next few days, the following access control procedures will
     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  (and  other  facilities  where
     practical):

          ?   As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
             the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to
             the bearer.

          ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present
             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S.
             driver's  license,  U.S.  or foreign passport, or some form of
             U.S. federal, state or local identification).

          ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must
             completely  fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without
             a  valid  photo  ID  (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign
             passport,  or  some  form  of  U.S.  federal,  state  or local
             identification)  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron
             Center.

          ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron
             employee or badged contractor at all times.

          ?   Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an
             Enron  employee  or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's
             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged
             contractor,   and  escorted  to  their  appointment.   At  the
             conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor, the visitor
             badge  collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the
             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged
             contractor.

          ?   Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines; report
             suspicious  activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open
             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors
             open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be
     instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that all employees be patient during
     congested  times  in  the  lobby.   As we proceed and obtain increased
     guard   personnel  and  equipment,  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to
     decrease.   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted
     for the security of all our employees.


     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we have two important
     recommendations:

          ?   While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided.   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia,
             Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia,
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In  addition,  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West
             Bank,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be
             very carefully considered.

          ?    For  non-U.S.  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States,
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation.
             There  have  been  several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights.  As  a
             result,  we  suggest  that all non-U.S. citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport, Form I-94 and
             Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of  18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation
             with  them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card,  Form  I-94  card, Employment Authorization Card, Border
             Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card. Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   ""registration""   documentation,  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere, it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status.

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

We were scheduled to meet with you on Monday and were going to incorporate the oil spill cleanup meeting.  With respect to that, we have the international solution ready.  We took it upon ourselves to address the same issue with the domestic pipes and Kyle found Phil Lowry to be extremely interested.

Regarding the meeting with our group - could we do it Thursday if convenient?  A couple people will be out tomorrow.  Thanks again very much Steve.

As you know, we were able to quickly account for our traveling employees, keep information flowing to our business units and management, and make quick, sound judgments on the issues we faced. It was gratifying to see such a calm, competent and proactive group assemble and get the job done.


There will be much more to do in the coming weeks and months.  I feel much better about what lies ahead knowing that I can count on you.

I hope all of your family and friends are well.  If you have former colleagues, family or friends who were affected by last week's tragedies, you have my sympathy and my offer to help in any way I can.

Again, my thanks.

Steve,

I talked with Cindy a few weeks ago about a salary adjustment for me (and Mary) following the HR re-org (actually this was probably end of June). Cindy indicated she had discussed this with you and that some recommendations had either been agreed or where being considered. I think she suggested she (or you) may prefer to agree a new/extended employment agreement, which I would be happy to discuss.

Either way, I really would like to close this out in the next few days since things are obviously moving on and I don't want this weighing in the back of my mind. 

If you would prefer I'd be happy to recommend, consider and approve it myself! I'm am incredibly fair and impartial, I assure you..........

your CEO stepped down today.

When you are ready to evaluate your options to staff the position, my CEO
and I would like to meet with you to discuss Allen Austin Lowe & Powers'
capabilities to do a thorough retain search for this position.  Two salient
points are: 1) We have filled 100% of our retained searches, and  2) We
guarantee our candidates for one year.

Allen Austin Lowe & Powers has done work for Enron in the past and is
located here in Houston.

30 August 2001

To:    Steve Kean, Enron

Request: Is ICE regulated by the CFTC?
Response: The Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission only to the extent the markets are made on the exchange for products that have already been designated futures contracts by the commission. 
 
ICE announced 28 August that its new clearing house, the formerly the London Clearing House of the International Petroleum Exchange, would clear cash-settled U.S. oil swaps for West Texas Intermediate crude and U.S. natural gas swaps at the Henry Hub. Since both of these underlying products trade as futures contracts in the U.S., the derivative product traded on ICE is regulated as well. The fact that the futures trade on another exchange, the New York Mercantile Exchange, is immaterial.
 
The ICE said its London Clearing House has applied to the CFTC for recognition as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Section 5b(d) of the Commodities Exchange, Act, as added by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA),  provides that DCOs shall be deemed to be registered under this section to the extent that the DCO clears agreements, contracts, or transactions for a board of trade that has been designated by the Commission as a contract market for such agreements, contracts, or transactions before the date of enactment of this section. This provision captures all futures clearing organizations that have ever cleared any futures contracts for designated contract markets before the CFMA became effective.
 
DCOs of both traditional open outcry exchanges, as well as electronic-only exchanges, have been approved by the CFTC. Applications by the Intercontinental Exchange and Hedge Street, Inc., appear to be pending.  A CFTC official told Intellibridge that few applications to create DCOs have been submitted since the CFMA was signed.
 
Sources:
CFTC, <http://www.cftc.gov/dea/dearegistered_dco.htm>
ICE, <https://www.intcx.com/pressaug01c.html>

TAP (US & Canada), Navigant (Nepco, Seattle) Vitol (Domestic), Ayscough (London), Imperial Tour (PGE, Portland) and Travel Management Consultants (EES, Chicago) confirmed that we did not have any employees booked on flight 587.  

Eight (8) employees were identified with reservations to leave New York yesterday.  They were all contacted and ultimately able to proceed with travel plans.

I was watching the meeting from my desk.  If my question was asked and answered, I missed it and apologize for asking again.  This is a question that is traditionally asked at these meetings :

Ken,

Where do you think the stock price will be at the end of the year?

Subject:	Letter to employees in Enron Europe
Importance:	High

John Sherriff and Michael Brown would like to send out the attached letter to employees in Europe this afternoon (ie in the next 3 hours).  I would be grateful if you would review it and let us have your approval as soon as possible.

I have a couple of questions in relation to the content:

1.  Can we refer to Wessex Water on our list of non-core assets in Europe?

2.  Can we list the specific businesses under review as per the proposed draft below (which is not included in the attached draft?)

""The businesses currently under review in Europe are Global Markets (except Coal), Industrial Markets, Metals, Credit and the Wind Turbine manufacturing business.  Also under review is the E Power generation asset development business in Japan"".  Given that these businesses are being identified in the media I would assume that we can although note that they don't appear in your message point summary received last night.

A prompt response would be very much appreciated.  Thanks.

Jackie

Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson.  Apparently, he's running

Steve the comment compilation is a laundry list.  I think that some of them are completely out of sync and unjustified but others are real and many repeat themselves.  Many of the comments are with respect to salary.  There is also the theory that only the unhappy or bitter or unsuccessful take the time to answer.  The happy ones might just have passed on this one.  

I hope you find them relevant and/or useful.  

I was told that William Lemons of the associate program saw this list a couple of months ago and reacted positively.  A raise is being studied for current associates and the offers were higher for this year ?s summer associates.

Best,

 << File: AA_Program_Comments.doc >> 

Comments from MBA Class 2000

1.	We need to reconcile the difference between ENE's salaries vs competitors' and other Houston companies.

2.	We need better guidance in the rotation selection (I've seen lot of good people being screwed because choosing a bad area to work due to lack of information).

3.	Regardless of whether you like your rotation or not, the Program itself is staffed in a very amateur manner.  There are a few really good people but for the most part it is just not professionally run.  Calls unanswered, lots of passing the buck, and general disorganization.

4.	If they have resources, they do a poor job of communicating them.  While we do have a responsibility to find info ourselves, there should be an active effort to point us to those resources.

5.	Compensation.  The bonus part is certainly not communicated as being locked into a fixed range and independent of business unit performance.  At the very least, this is a serious oversight.  

6.	PRC.  Really doesn't work.  Not an apple to apples comparison.  Heavily dependent on when/where you rotated.

7.	I could care less about Enron's reputation.  I tried paying my student loans with ""reputation"" but they only accepted cash.  How much money can I make at this place assuming the stock price doesn't double every few months, in effect preventing Enron from getting the public equity markets to pay my compensation?  

8.	Also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in terms of the PRC, where before Enron was penalizing the ""have issues"" classification of the PRC, now it feels like they are trying to get rid of 20% of the pool. Reinforcing the first paragraph.

9.	Offer of salary is cloaked and we don't know where we can end up.

10.	I believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the head office. As a result, the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false expectations. And obviously when those expectations are not met, we all know the consequences.

11.	The rest of the downtown Houston Energy concerns are paying much higher base

12.	Can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against?  Is it really Wall Street and consulting?  If so, I'd like to see the names of the firms.  New York is not that expensive that the ""well they're in New York"" excuse covers all discrepancies.  It feels like we must be benchmarking against second or third tier MBA recruiters.

13.	There's a feeling among the Associate pool that you need to be in a secure, established, money making division in order to guarantee a average or above PRC for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom brackets and not be fired.  That goes against the long- term reputation of Enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks. 

14.	Attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others rotating but do not expect to get displaced by a 1st rotation associate that is placed by the AA pool.

15.	Assignment of 1st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was more of an analyst function than it was an associate function.  Why can't alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the in coming candidate?

16.	Manage expectations...don't need to hear about 26 year old trader and Louise Kitchen's rise to fame with Enron Online...creates an expectation that those are more common occurrences than they really are.

17.	It doesn't feel like there's a lot to do in all areas, nonetheless something between 60 and 100 new associates coming in these fall: First, why that many?  Second, do they know what they are getting into?

18.	The main issues have to do with compensation being well below market - we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up for the disparity, but given the declining stock value, lack of meaningful rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the program this is becoming a much bigger issue.

19.	Enron is so secretive about salaries that Associates have no idea what the upside looks like.  Working for beans in year 1 is ok if years 2-5 are excellent.  We really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus after the program is over.

20.	Salary well below market (base salary and value of options/bonus) - even if they bring us up to the 2001 offers (which are rumored to be under market), we have 1 year or more experience with the class coming in and will be paid the same amount?

21.	Lack of quality rotations (cuts in EBS, EES, ect...)

22.	Level of responsibility is well below expectations/maturity level

23.	Compensation for Associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for Top B-Schools.  Not only in comparison to IB and Consulting, but also compared to specialties (brand management, etc.) that are at the lower end of the MBA scale.  It is cheaper to live in Houston but our student loans are not indexed by location.  Other energy companies here in town even pay more.  

24.	The Enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and not carrots.  There is no other company I know that expects full repayment of a signing bonus 18 months after the start date.  If the Program is truly special people should not be forced to repay anything-Enron should deliver what they advertise and people will stay.  The 18-month lock up period suggests a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the Associate and not an improvement in the Program. 

25.	How much do managers make assuming certain business and individual performance levels?  I've got no clue but I'm wondering why it such a big secret? 

26.	The PRC process does not encourage people to experiment in their rotations as Enron implies.  For example, if you take a rotation in an area you know nothing about, you will lose in the PRC because you are still learning the job.  Similarly, if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation, you will be rewarded a PRC time.

27.	There are too many associates and too few analysts.   Too many associate rotations become exercises in finding something to do.  Too often, associates think to themselves, I remember doing this several years ago as an undergrad, why am I doing this again.

28.	They should present the program for what it is -an internal labor pool where Associates find their own rotations depending on what is available and who they know.  The Program does not match people with jobs and should make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs, etc upon entry into the program.  This is not because they want Associates to have choice, but rather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations.  

29.	If we are not going to be competitive with Wall Street and consulting, we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors.  I don't know what companies we are benchmarking against but I guarantee we are not keeping up.  Small differences can create a lot animosity towards the program.  When a person who didn't get into Enron but got into a competitor makes materially more money from the start, people start believing they have just been sold a lot of hype.

30.	Not enough development during rotations - even associates who end up learning a lot don't necessarily enjoy their rotations because they don't feel part of the team

31.	Not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your first rotation is a moral buster as well.  Additionally, it can waste a lot of time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have no interest in.

32.	Compensation - many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower base and bonus package from Enron because the stock price movement promised large equity based compensation.  Also, it was very difficult to find out what full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process.  Most wrongly believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus other leading MBA avenues.  How much money do people at Enron make assuming the stock price performs1. Great 2. Okay, 3. Poor?  

33.	Responsibility - when you are getting recruited you always here the Louise Kitchen, John Arnold, and Greg Whalley examples as if that is normal.  We need to stop doing that.  Enron's slowing growth rate and failure in everything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we look more and more like a large corporation.  

34.	The program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out.  If this is true, why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in fewer, higher quality associates from the start - the process of weeding out leaves everyone with a bad feeling.  More importantly, you probably lose more good people then you realize.

35.	Trading, trading, trading.  On MBA campus visits, Enron gives the impression that there are lots of corporate development & M&A, finance, and other similar assignments available at Enron.  The reality seems that if you are not interested in trading for a living, you are not on the company's main commercial track any longer.

36.	Finding a Rotation: Information difficult to get; it is all networking. This is fine, but I don't consider the A/A progrram a resource in this area at all. If no one else does, we should cut any expenses they are incurring for ""rotation placement"".

37.	The skew on associate bonuses hurts morale.  You can reward the high performers without penalizing the good performers.  Recently, the word has gotten around 	that the top 5% and the next 15% of the PRC group got very large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses?  This distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger number of unhappy people.

38.	""I find it interesting that Enron chooses to 1- adopt a business model based upon free-market economics, and 2- pride itself on its intellectual capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial services player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence.  In selecting an employer this was a HUGE selling point.  I find it paradoxical, however, that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be described as socialistic, and below market.  In a labor market where intellectual capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive advantage in the form of this asset, I can only believe that Enron is positioning itself to fall short in the years to come when J. Aron, Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, El Paso, etc. decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on Enron is to higher this intellectual capital.  Without griping, I feel if nothing else, workers at Enron would like to be paid market rate for the talents we possess.  In our ""sales pitch"" we are told that Enron benchmarks pay against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on Wall Street.  I can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a candle to the potential for a Wall Street style pay package, which leaves me bitter that the sales pitch was shallow, fell short, or was deliberately misguided.  Part of the problem, from an Associates perspective, stems from Enron promising the moon and then falling short on delivery.  Like a company that fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market, punishment for such a shortfall is swift and severe.  I truly believe Enron is setting itself up for such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly.

39.	In an extension of the contradiction between free market economics and socialistic patronage, I have come to notice that more and more departments are positioning themselves to hire Associates under the guise that the Associate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months.  Further, many desks, once happy with the performance of the Associate, ask for the ""option"" to retain the Associate.  However, no effort is made to compensate the Associate for essentially giving up the ""optionality"" embedded in a rotational program.  In fact, many choosing to stay within a group have made their experiences explicitly known to others that come PRC time, they have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead opting to join a unit full time.  By removing the ability of business units to promote a worker until conclusion of the 18-24 month period, hard working, good-fit Associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would seem to be a natural fit for a full-time position, and the chance to alleviate a significant source of discontent-COMPENSATION- which could be addressed through the immediate promotion to the Manager level.  By allowing for promotion, Associates could earn enhanced compensation, and department heads could address hiring needs.  Rather, Associates leave a unit disgruntled, feeling they are marking time in other units, potentially passing up an alternative that may be of great interest.  Additionally, a number of Commercial units have even gone so far as refusing to hire Associates unless they are in their third or fourth rotation, so as to retain a ""call option"" on an employee that has run out of rotation alternatives.  This practice CANNOT be in the best interest of the Desks, the Program, or for that matter Enron.  By pigeonholing employees in this matter, the significance and importance of rotations is greatly diminished, as is our work experience.  This is just ludicrous!  Department heads aren't looking to hire externally because of the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade.  Rather, they are trying to plug a Manager level position with an Associate salary.  Again, rather than pay a competitive, performance-based wage, Enron has adopted a tight-fisted, socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses.  Ultimately, this will lead to people seeking to ""rotate"" out of Enron for the compensation the market will bare.   

40.	I think A/A provides an excellent opportunity to find the department that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job, chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates, than for regular employees.

41.	We get solid commercial responsibility from the get go - I doubt many of the guys who went to NY had this.

42.	We get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as I produce.

43.	Salaries: Not in line with market.

44.	Mentors: Not encouraged throughout the organization. 

45.	Recruiting: Disorganized, not enough student focus, trying to compete with the IBanks but not willing to offer the salaries, sometimes unprofessional conduct (rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and gave message 'you are not good enough').

46.	Summer Intern Program: Not well coordinated. 

47.	Rotation Length: Keep flexibility. 6 mos sometimes too short (other times too long); disincents management to include Associates in longer term/meatier projects.

48.	When is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited?

49.	Overall, Enron has a great group of people to work with.

50.	Enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds, ethnicity, and nationalities within the company.

51.	Enron has an excellent overall atmosphere

52.	Overall, Enron has an excellent overall company image

53.	I do not have too many comments. My main problem with the last team was that they were extremely rigid - rigid start date, rigidity in assigning groups, etc. Old group did one-way dialogues, they would not even listen. The new group appears flexible and is willing to listen - these are two things I feel are most important in running such program.

54.	Three months ago I talked with Althea Gordon about a couple of friends that graduated with me from my business school.  They wanted (still want) to work for Enron. I sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a response (I believe she left Enron). I then contacted Patricia Payton. Several emails, phone calls and still haven't heard from her. It's frustrating dealing with the HR dept.

55.	PRC is not a trusted mechanism.  Few people in the program understand it fully, no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings, and no one believes the results are truly equitable.  Politics appears to play as much of a role as performance, if not more so, in determining rankings.  Further, groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately ranked people.  For as much as individuals' success depends upon this ranking, and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be, that policy is incredibly inconsistent.

56.	We are under market for compensation - everyone knows this, regardless of what the program people say.  It is common knowledge that at least Reliant and El Paso are paying their program participants more in salary and bonus.  The decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incoming participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries flat and was not well received (obviously).

57.	Rotation placement service is not very useful.  The best way to find a good rotation remains through networking.

58.	The experience, talent, and character of the associate pool continue to be excellent.

59.	Cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing.  Comeraderie among the class is widespread and genuine.

60.	The efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new A/A program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right direction.


61.	Historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain internal communication and networking within each associate class and to create new networks between individual associate classes.  Efforts by individual associates to affect this have not been supported.

62.	Mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered, particularly as rotation time approaches.  This would facilitate informal discussion about opportunities and business unit activity.  Additionally it would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rotations and introduce those interested to potential future managers.

63.	Compensation is clearly an issue.  Whether the compensation gap exists in reality or it only exists in perception, there is a widespread belief that Enron is under-compensating associates relative to both other firms in the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets are employed.  This is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severely underwater options.  Base salary should be addressed.

64.	Again, whether perception or reality, associates are concerned about selecting rotations in groups that are not making money.  The belief is that bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units.  Therefore, it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable group, regardless of the skill development it may offer.

65.	The mandatory eighteen-month service period before eligibility for promotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers.

66.	What happened to the A/A publication?

67.	There is no source available that provides a history of individual associates who have rotated through specific jobs.  It would be very beneficial to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for first-hand information on business units of interest.

68.	My assessment of the program thus far is that I think there are a lot of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the responsibilities that they plan to assign to the Associates before they get into the group.  Once in, I know of several people including myself that get a whole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations prior to joining that group.  Furthermore, I believe that Associates get work that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degree.  This is very frustrating because once your in, your in and you can't get out for 6 months.  On top of that, you get PRC reviews based on work that was not challenging and I do not believe that a fair and equitable assessment can be made.  

69.	Now I understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyone.  But the point is that much of this would never happen if people were upfront with their expectations prior to hiring on an Associate.  In addition, it bothers me that Associates are many times treated very, very poorly by their new groups.  This has not been the case for me, but I know people that have voiced these thoughts and opinions - so I am speaking for them incase they are too nervous to put it into writing.

70.	That is about it.  I would like to see some education come out of the Associate Program as to new groups that start within Enron, as well as some greater insight to particular groups and the expectations.

71.	When Enron recruited us, it was so different from what it is now.  So many diverse opportunities were out there.  Now, Enron is heading towards a pure trading house.  It is getting harder and harder to get a decent rotation out of trading.  But you don't need an MBA to be a trader!  In fact, Associates often work for analysts on the trading side, and we don't have any special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the trading side.  It is not a surprise some of us are thinking about ""getting the next rotation at El Paso"".

72.	A lot of business units think Associates come and go too quickly, and six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first, and then make meaningful contributions.  Some people think it is worthwhile to groom Associates, even less worthwhile than to cultivate Analysts, who are supposed to be there longer.  It is sometimes difficult for Associates to get meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us.

73.	Compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competitors.

74.	The company's direction has changed drastically from the one I interviewed for in November 2000, some of these strategies seem shortsighted and in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in the energy business in the long term; specifically:

75.	The stated strategy of exiting all generation, exploration, and transportation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the company and earns us a banking multiple on the street.  Also, with additional players entering the gas and power markets in a major way, how can we expect to continue to grow and maintain our current market share?

76.	Along with our success there have been many failed business ventures; including Azurix, Enron International, Dabhol, EBS, and EES.  The failures of EES and EBS have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not been totally priced in to our stock price.  Bottom line; there does not appear to be any large areas of growth within the company.

77.	Pay! When the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 dollars more to do the same job; it doesn't make you feel very intelligent to be working here.  Additionally, when I accepted this position I was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and what the determinants are of the annual bonus.  What I have heard through the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what I was led to believe during recruiting.  Not having any assistance and having attended a top East coast school, I am almost $100,000 dollars in debt.  I was counting on the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck, but in reality after my debt service I am barely better off than when I worked as an engineer in manufacturing.

78.	I don't see much difference in the kind of assignments between Analysts and Associates. It seems unfair for Analysts since they get lower salaries, but it is also a waste of ""years of experience"" in the case of Associates.  It is probably the number of Associates hired every year through the Program gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units. Be certain the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an Associate.

79.	If you look at A/A as human capital, we at Enron are very long in background, experience and knowledge. The A/A Program is ""Regulation"" using Enron terminology: from rotation assignments, to payments. I see pretty logical the consequences: a lot of inefficiencies, waste of energy, the lack of objectivity, poor motivation or even frustration, in general performance is far away from excellent. Add some flexibility to the Program: let the people choose their rotations and move without restrictions. Let them also negotiate working conditions, salaries, and career path with the business unit.

80.	PRC is unfair. I consider offensive writing in a maximum of 5 lines 6 months of accomplishments. I don't think a PRC Committee can better assess the performance than the business unit. 360-degree evaluations, and peers review are ok.  Re-think the need of a committee and a ranking of A/A assigned to so different business units.

81.	I feel free to choose for a second rotation. I like the way you can approach a new business unit, introduce yourself, have an interview and gathered information about the business and your position. Things may change after that and you get stacked in that place for at least 6 months. Keep allowing people to search and move freely from HR.


82.	Make staff more accountable.  Online based.  Much like the IT department, where when I call it initiates a request that I must approval closure of with any comments.

83.	Tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make Manager.  Not communicated at all.

84.	Tell people that their first rotations are assigned.  Also not communicated.

85.	I wish I had a PRC suggestion, but I need to think about it.

86.	Don't insult my intelligence by giving incoming Associates more money but putting it in a bonus so you don't have to give us raises.  If you want to do that, give me the courtesy of being up front about it.

87.	Some kind of database (maybe there is one that I don't know about) of openings.  Would be pretty cool.

88.	Raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors - at the least so it is equal.

89.	Make the development and support of associates a more important criterion in the PRC process for both directors and Vice Presidents.  The commercial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely

90.	Reduce the size of each incoming class - make the program special again.  Right now, I can't believe the broad spread in ability and experience in the associate class.  I guarantee the spread is not that high in other top tier firms that hire MBAs.

91.	With the smaller size, assign a lead commercial person to a group of 5 associates.  The lead commercial person (a director or VP) would keep in touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the most of their rotations and Enron gets the most out of them

92.	Make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these groups know when they need a clerk, analyst, or associate.  Too often we treat analysts, clerks, and 30-year-old associates with 6-8 years of experience the same.  This happens way too much.

93.	The program should work with the incoming associates a little closer to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they want to take and design a plan on how to get them there.

	Subject:        17/7 - 7:00 p.m. - Update: Emergency 

	The situation continues to be stable.  CLHB has reinitated LPG operations to LaPaz, but continue their inspection.  TR will not reinitiate gas or crude export operations until we have completed our inspection.  We have formed joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.  It could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning.   All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano.  The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.  Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert.

	Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and inspection action plan.  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (the regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

	We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz.  Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed with the message.

	We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.  In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary.

	The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.  Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we're still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, or if it is against government.  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow.  Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.  The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void.  We're watching this situation closely.  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational situation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

	At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.  Our OSSA II (crude exports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediate threat neutralized.

	However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will notify the Enron Crisis team.

	We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network.  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply.  I've notified all relevant government authorities of the situation, and so far am getting support.  I've also asked the Embassy to look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful.

	Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our people complete the overall plan.

	I will keep you posted as things develop.

Subject:	Severance Issues  - a suggestion

Steve,

I have been told that the severance program is ""under review"".

As you well know, many long term, dedicated Enron employees who have been with the company for nearly a decade have seen their entire net worth completely wiped out.  Retirement plans, college funds, etc have all evaporated.  Since the average tenure for an Enron employee is rather short, I believe that this subset is actually quite small.  This small subset of employees has been wronged.  I believe one way to cushion this blow is to alter the severance equation as follows:


4 weeks X (number of employment years)
1 week X  (each 10,000 of salary)

Example one: 2 year employee with an $80,000 salary = 2*4+80/10 = 16 weeks severance

Example two: 10 year employee with a $100,000 salary = 10*4+100/10 = 50 weeks severance

This will accomplish two tasks, one is to skew the severance towards the longer term employees, the other is to reduce the total outlay so as not to overburden the company (since the group receiving the higher severance is small). I believe this is fair to both the employees and to our soon-to-be new management.  Pls consider running this by management and or some focus groups, if in fact, the package is under review.

"RE: Open Enrollment Communication","I think the communication is extremely well put together and informative.  The phone option (with the keying in of each letter) looks very complicated but I'm not sure that there is a better way to do it (it will probably just encourage more people to make their elections online).

The message from Ken about increasing costs should be modified, I think.  First, I think we may be overstating it to say that the cost increases for future periods threaten the health of the company  ... I know it's a play on the ""health"" theme, but I think it comes off as unnecessarily alarmist.  Second, and on a related point, I think we should be a bit clearer that we can't keep this up and absent some major change in the underlying cost of health care we are likely to increase the employee contribution in ""03 and beyond.  Finally, I think Greg Whalley and Mark Frevert should see this part of the message at least (after we make changes).

Again, I think this is a very good communications piece.  Nice work.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

Thanks-
Amy Richard

Hi Steve,
I wanted to extend my sincere thanks to you for coming to Rice to
interview and recruit. It was so enjoyable meeting you and having the
opportunity to chat about Enron. I had a great experience there this
summer, and I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for a
full-time position. Thanks again for your time.

Sincerely,
Annie

"RE: NOrm Coleman","I talked to Ken yesterday.  I had also talked to Linda Robertson.  Linda was a little concerned about taking on an incumbent (now majority) Senator.  I told Ken we should wait a bit and he agreed.

Who else is going to run from the Republican side?  I think that we ultimately ought to support a Republican in this race, incumbency or no.  But I want to make sure we back the right one.

"FW: Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC)","Here is the most recent update I have.  I have asked our DC office to give you a further updat and to look into what else we should be doing.
The summary below is a bit dated (as is everything done before sept 11).  Congress is now expected to adjourn this month not next.  Otherwise, the report on the prognosis for ultimate passage remains accurate I believe.

Subject: RE: Wind Production Tax Credit (PTC)


Amit - Congress is on recess until September and will not adjourn in October as planned.  We expect Congress to be in session until late November or even into December. 

The PTC extension was passed out of the House in its energy package (it was part of the tax title).  The Senate Committee is expected to consider its version of the energy in September into October.  We expect the PTC to pass in the Senate as well.

Now to the timing, it is unclear if the energy package (with the PTC extension)will move before Congress adjourns for the year.  If it does not, then Congress can pass what it calls an ""extenders package"" which would extend all tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year.  If that were to not happen, then Congress could send notice to the Administration that it plans to pass the PTC and other extenders early next year and make it retroactive until December 31, 2001.  Any of theses scenarios is possible.

While nothing is 100% when you deal with Congress, I think it highly likely the PTC will be extended either this year or retroactively next.  The question then becomes for how long.  The House bill extends it for five years and we are pushing for longer in the Senate.  I do not think a permanent extension is possible given the revenue numbers.

Let me know if you need additional information.

Chris,

We wanted to get an update on what was happending with the PTC in Washington.  Are we still on track to get an extension before Congress adjourns in early October?  What if any impact will the debate surrounding the reduction in the budget surplus have on the PTC?

thanks

					Mark - I left a voice mail on your cell.

					The Wind Production Tax Credit expires on December 31, 2001.   The PTC will be extended.   There is significant bipartisan support for the PTC, the revenue number is reasonable, and renewables are a key component of the energy debate.

					The question is when and how.  Two likely scenarios are:

					1)  As part of the Energy Bill.  The House Ways and Means Committee will mark-up the tax portions of the energy bill in mid-July.  We understand that Chairman Thomas is committed to including the PTC as part of the Ways and Means bill.  The Senate Finance Committee has not scheduled a mark-up.  While the energy bill will be debated during July, final action will likely not occur until after the August recess.   In this scenario, look to September at the earliest.

					2)  There are 10 provisions, including the PTC,  in the IRC that expire by December 31, 2001.   Historically, Congress approves an ""extenders"" package late in the session to keep the tax credits functioning.   While no one can predict when Congress will adjourn, they are set to adjourn in early October.  In this scenario, the PTC would be extended in late September at the earliest.

					Mark, this is Congress, so anything can change.  

					Call me with any questions at (202) 466-9158.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Steve,

I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  

I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 

I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.

Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.

Terrie

Red Herring's advertisement revenues in July were down 70% from 2K.  The pages that it runs ads on are down 77%. The circulation of 316,000 is lower than National Parks magazine, Muscle and Fitness, and 4-Wheel and Off-Road.

Enron lived up to its financial promises for almost 6 years straight -- EVERY QUARTER. Their revenues DOUBLED in 2K. They are # 7 on the Fortune 500.  They are moving 58% more product than 2K.  Their new weather, metals, lumber and steel divisions DOUBLED volumes in the second quarter from 2K.  Net income in the second quarter was up 40% from 2K.

Subject:	California Update 07.18.01

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two ""informational"" hearings that ""this is it,"" despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the ""July 12"" date changed to ""the effective date of the bill"" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a ""fair"" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Dear Mr Kean,

In follow up to the recent email sent to Enron seeking the company's
interest to participate as a sponsor in the WTO Forum next March, I haven't
heard back from you and as events in the US have overshadowed any business
decisions last week, I thought it prudent to wait until now to pick up my
correspondence.

With WTO now certain for the PRC, I am hoping that you may have reviewed the
proposal sent and discussed it amongst the appropriate people within Enron
and at least have a preliminary view on interest at this point.  I would
certainly be happy to follow up on any further questions or information that
you require.

Kindly advise at your earliest convenience as to the next step in the
process of consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you.

	Paul Krugman has made frequent negative references to Enron and its management in his New York Times column over the last twelve months.  I have refrained from responding until now.  Below (and in the attached in Word format) is a letter I hope you will print.  If you wish to contact me, you can call my office (713.621.6550) or page me (888.906.9761).

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Subject:	RTO week message

How we frame ""RTO week"" could have a big impact on what, if anything, happens legislatively between now and the end of the session.  While we all realize that what Pat Wood laid out last week was of enormous import, I don't think we can afford to allow that to become the conventional wisdom.  

In fact, that will be the message of our opponents: ""Pat Wood turned the world upside down last week.  He went off in a radical direction that he doesn't even possess the authority to go in.  You have to do something before his December 15th deadline.""

I believe we have to consistently send the message that ""he went in a direction that's perfectly consistent with previous commission orders fitting with previously set timeframes.  It's the action you'd expect a new chairman to take in order to get his arms around a big and possibly contentious issue.""  

We should point out that he took a very middle-of-the-road approach.  We can contrast what Pat Wood laid out versus a more radical approach that he didn't take.

The more often we can aggressively drive media coverage and send signals in the press, especially in DC,  that this is orderly business as usual with no need for outside intervention, the more likely we are to avoid legislative action.

On top of the day to day activity to drive this message, I think we should look at some media briefings, probably a combination of conference calls and one-on-one interviews.  Sooner would be better than later given the truncated legislative schedule.

Dear Mr. Lay ---

As a recently terminated employee of Enron, I have watched the stock's
dramatic tumble in the last weeks mount on top of the horrible performance
over the last months.  As Chairman and CEO, you are ultimately responsible
for everything that goes on in the company.  Without getting into the
potentially criminal and certainly ill-conceived activities of you and other
Enron executives, past and present, I think you have done little but pay lip
service in order to correct things.

Mr. Lay, you and the other executives receive very large salaries.  None of
you is hurting for money.  I think it unconscionable that you and other
executives continue to draw a paycheck.  While employees and others like me
have seen our net worth go from respectable sums to zero, you remain wealthy
beyond most of our dreams.  What's worse, you take more from the company
every week in the form of pay.  I realize you haven't had a soul in quite
sometime.  But are you so unconcerned with the well-being of the people like
me who believed in you and worked years and years for you, that you feel
justified adding insult to injury?  You have literally ruined the lives of
thousands of people.  Your employees deserve better than this!  I was
terminated at mid-year because my book was losing $2 million.  That's right,
$2 million!  That's after I'd made tens of millions for you over the past
eight years.  You and yours have lost me more than that of my own personal
money now.  I don't quite know how to fire you.

It's obvious that neither you nor any other executive currently in power at
Enron have any credibility whatsoever.  Cutting off difficult questions on a
conference call or ignoring pointed questions from employees don't go along
way in restoring any credibility or respect.  There is none left, and yet
you continue to take money out of the Enron coffers for yourself in the form
of compensation.  The hubris there is so incredible to me that it defies
comprehension.

Why, exactly, is Enron paying you?  Do you feel justified being paid by
Enron?  Do you feel justified seeing Enron pay large sums of money to others
involved while those of us with our retirement and childrens' education
funds tied up in Enron suffer more?

I worked at Enron from May of 1993 until this month.  I watched my net worth
increase substantially with my hard work at Enron.  Now, in the blink of an
eye, my net worth has plummeted to levels I haven't experienced since long
before I went to work at Enron.  I worked there for nearly nine years and
now have nothing to show for it.  Well, that's not entirely true.  I have
learned a valuable lesson.  I will never put my faith in someone again like
I did in you.  I now know that you couldn't care less about the well-being
of your employees.  You do still, however, show an incredible capacity for
greed.  You continue to rob the company of funds that could be going to more
useful places.

As I said, I was terminated because my book had $2 million in losses YTD
based on a couple of bad trades and some bad positions I inherited.  In this
pay-for-performance world, where does that leave you?  You continue to
enrich yourself while losing billions of dollars every single day.  I
imagine the PRC would have looked poorly on me if I lost 10-30% of the
company's value each day the market was open.

I no longer work for Enron, but I am left holding the bag with a ton of
worthless options and shares in my 401(k).  I only have a short time in
which to exercise those options.  I don't have the luxury of waiting for
enough good news to come out of the company to make them valuable.  I'm just
one of the thousands upon thousands of financial lives you've ruined.  The
very people that have made you rich you have made poor.  And somehow, you
seem to smile as you keep doing it!

I'd like your response as to why you feel it necessary for you and notable
others to continue to take money from the rest of us in the form of a
paycheck.  Please write me back.

Sincerely,


Scott Hendrickson

Hi,

I would like to participate on the Employee PRC Committee. I am an analyst who has been at Enron for two years. I have recently come out of a group where I think the PRC process has been misapplied not only to me but many others. I think there is too much ""smoke"" in this process, especially at the analyst level where we don't participate in PRC meetings even at the group level. I have many other concerns about the current process that could have me typing away here for the next hour , so please consider including me in this.

Thanks,

     Subject:  Security Update


     Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
     Some  of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
     personnel) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
     be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that will have an impact on everyday
     activities.   In all the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
     will  be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring
     to  increase  your sense of security, while doing our best to minimize
     disruption to our day-to-day business.

     Primary  responsibility  for  Enron  Corp.  Security  resides  in  our
     business  controls  organization.   You  can contact this organization
     through  their  website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>),  by phone
     (713-345-2804),     or     by    email    (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
     <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John Brindle, Senior Director,
     Business  Controls,  leads  this  organization.   Please  feel free to
     provide  John  and  his  team  with your comments and questions, or to
     report security threats.

     We  have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
     for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston and changes to our travel
     advisory.

     Access to the Enron Center

     Over  the  next few days, the following access control procedures will
     be  instituted  at  the  Enron  Center  (and  other  facilities  where
     practical):

          ?   As  employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter
             the Enron Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to
             the bearer.

          ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present
             a  valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S.
             driver's  license,  U.S.  or foreign passport, or some form of
             U.S. federal, state or local identification).

          ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID
             when   signing  in  at  the  lobby  reception  desk  and  must
             completely  fill out the visitor card.  Adult visitors without
             a  valid  photo  ID  (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign
             passport,  or  some  form  of  U.S.  federal,  state  or local
             identification)  will  not  be  allowed  access  to  the Enron
             Center.

          ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must be escorted by an Enron
             employee or badged contractor at all times.

          ?   Visitors  to  the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an
             Enron  employee  or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's
             log  at  the  lobby  reception  area by the employee or badged
             contractor,   and  escorted  to  their  appointment.   At  the
             conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
             the  lobby  by  an  employee or badged contractor, the visitor
             badge  collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the
             plaza  reception  area  by  the  escorting  employee or badged
             contractor.

          ?   Employees are also being asked to participate in the security
             of  their  workplace  by  following  these  guidelines; report
             suspicious  activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open
             secured  doors  for  individuals  unknown to you or hold doors
             open, allowing ""tail gating"" by others.

     These  will  be the first in a series of new security procedures to be
     instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that all employees be patient during
     congested  times  in  the  lobby.   As we proceed and obtain increased
     guard   personnel  and  equipment,  we  expect  the  inconvenience  to
     decrease.   We hope you understand these measures are being instituted
     for the security of all our employees.


     Travel Advisory Update

     With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we have two important
     recommendations:

          ?   While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
             recommends  that  travel  through  or  to  the  Middle East be
             avoided.   We  continue  to strongly recommend that all travel
             during  this  time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pakistan, Indonesia,
             Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia,
             and   the  Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In  addition,  we
             recommend  that  planned  travel  to  Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West
             Bank,  Jordan,  Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia, Syria, and Algeria be
             very carefully considered.

          ?    For  non-U.S.  citizens  traveling  in  the  United  States,
             corporate  security  recommends  that you carry documentation.
             There  have  been  several recent reports of non-U.S. citizens
             who reside in the United States being questioned and asked for
             documentation  when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights.  As  a
             result,  we  suggest  that all non-U.S. citizens who currently
             reside  in  the  United States - and who do not have Permanent
             Resident  Alien  status  - carry their passport, Form I-94 and
             Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest that Permanent
             Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card as
             proof  of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears
             that  Immigration  Officials  may be applying a section of the
             Immigration and Nationality Act that requires individuals over
             the  age  of  18 to carry his/her ""registration"" documentation
             with  them at all times. This can include a Permanent Resident
             Card,  Form  I-94  card, Employment Authorization Card, Border
             Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary  Resident  Card. Immigration
             Officials have not historically been asking domestic travelers
             for   ""registration""   documentation,  but  in  light  of  the
             heightened  security measures and current atmosphere, it would
             be  best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving
             your current lawful status.

     We  will  keep you apprised of new information and developments on the
     Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Subject: DRAFT - A/A Program Recruiting and Travel


Please give me your thoughts on this.  I've had a few questions so far, and I think alot of people are wondering about this.  I would send it to the Executive Leads for each school, the Program Department in Houston and the HR Leads.  Steve - I'd like your opinion to be sure that I'm consistent with our corporate position. 
 
Thanks,
Billy
___________________
 
The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program.
 
Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities.  Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel.  With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities.  
 
Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus.  I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications.  Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books.  The focusing benefits of these tools can signficantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities.  In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations.
 
Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me at extension 36671.
 
Best regards,
Billy Lemmons

Subject:	Marlys Palumbo

Dear Jim:

I have a good friend here in Seattle named Ralph Palumbo, who is one of the
attorneys with whom we prosecuted the antitrust case against Microsoft that
we settled last year.  His wife Marlys, whom I also know well, is a
candidate for appointment as the administrator of Region 10 of the
Environmental Protection Agency, which encompasses Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, and Alaska.  I know that you are busy as hell, but I wanted to set
out below some information about Marlys and about the status of her efforts
to win this appointment, and then ask whether Enron might be interested in
supporting her candidacy by putting in a good word at the White House.

Marlys received her law degree from Seattle University in 1982.  She then
spent four years as a commercial litigation associate at Bogle & Gates in
Seattle.  From 1986-89 she was general counsel of Sabey Corporation (a
diversified real estate development holding company).  From 1989-1997 she
was vice president and general counsel of Philip Environmental Inc.
(formerly Burlington Environmental), which was a publicly traded $500
million waste management and environmental engineering and remediation
company with operations in the U.S. and Canada.  In 1997 that company merged
with two other public companies to form Philip Services Corporation.  From
the date of the merger through the present, Marlys has been Senior VP, Law,
of Philip Services Corp., which is a $2 billion company that provides
integrated industrial and metals recovery services to commercial and
industrial customers in North America and Europe.  For the last several
years, Marlys has worked out of the Philip Services corporate offices in
Houston.

Marlys has in-depth expertise on environmental legal and scientific issues,
coupled with senior management experience in the business world.  She would
bring to the table a unique ability to effect a change of direction in EPA
Region 10 because she has worked effectively with this Region and other
Regions for two decades.  Implementing White House policies in Region 10
will require the Administrator to work with a staff of long-term
professional civil servants who themselves have extensive legal and
scientific expertise.  The Administrator must win their respect and must
have the personal skills to manage a large organization and lead it in new
directions.  Marlys has the experience, the skills, and the personal
qualities that would well-suit her to doing all of those things.

Her candidacy is being supported by former EPA Administrator Bill
Ruckelshaus, by other former senior EPA and Justice Department officials,
and by business and industry leaders in the Northwest, including CEOs or
other senior executives of Boeing, Weyerhaeuser, PACCAR, Puget Sound Energy,
Simpson Investments/Simpson Timber Co., Plum Creek Timber Group, Delta
Airlines, Burlington Northern, Air Cargo Management Group; FMC Corp., Fluke
Capital Management, and Sabey Corp.

My understanding is that the appointment will be made based on
recommendations from Republican Representatives and Senators from the four
states encompassed by Region 10, and key people in both the EPA and the
White House.  Washington has no Republican Senators, but Republican
Congresswoman Jennifer Dunn has recommended Marlys to the White House.

I have known Marlys since shortly after moving to Seattle in 1995.  She is
an extremely bright, charming, and capable person, and I have a lot of
respect for her.  If you think Enron would be willing to consider helping
her candidacy, I know that she would be eager to meet or talk with you or
others at Enron, and I can provide the names of the relevant contact people
at EPA and the White House.

I am not asking that you do anything as a favor to me, but only if it would
serve Enron's interests to do so.  Of course, this issue may be completely
outside the realm of those interests, and if so, I apologize for taking up
your time.  I hope all is well with you and Carrin, and look forward to
seeing both of you again soon.

We are moving along on the weather derivatives project.  Had a good meeting with Joe Hrgovic and others on the project and we are now interviewing a number of distribution utilities.

On another note, our Energy Club is fairly active at Wharton and would be very interested in featuring Terence Thorn if he is still with Enron (or your senior Government Affairs person if Mr. Thorn has left Enron).  Could you kindly let me know how to contact Mr. Thorn (or his replacement) so I can speak with him/her briefly.  My alterior motive in asking you to do this is that you might copy him on your email to me so that he knows we are doing some work together.

Thanks in advance.

Paul,

The speaker from Enron that I told you yesterday that I was interested in bringing in for the Energy Club Speaker Series is Terence H. Thorn, senior vice president, Environmental and International Government Affairs. A colleague of mine heard him speak in Kyoto in 1997 and said he gave a superb talk. As of 2000 he was still in this position, though I could not verify that he is now.

The proposed topic is Global Warming Policy and the Energy Industry.
---How will the Bonn agreement affect global strategy? What will be the near-term and long-term consequences of the agreement?
---How does US non-participation affect US market strategies versus strategies in participating countries?
---What is Enron's current position on global greenhouse gas policy? How is Enron managing and hedging this position?
---How will developing country energy markets participate in greenhouse gas mitigation?

The Energy Club Speaker Series takes place every other Monday from 4:30 to 6:30. There are a number of dates open during Fall semester.

I appreciate very much your help in trying to arrange this. Please let me know if there is any other information you need.

Thank you,
Amy

Hi Michael

Remember we talked about the Kyoto conference and you said you heard the
Govt Affairs guy at Enron give an amazing speech about global warming? I
ran the idea to get a speaker on global warming by the 2nd yr in charge
of the Energy Club (http://dolphin.upenn.edu/~energy), and he thought
that would be great. And furthermore, the prof who I do research
for(Paul Kleindorfer)said he is very well connected with the big guys at
Enron and would love to jointly sponsor the talk. SO, do you remember
the guy's name? Was it Robert Reilly possibly? I don't know if he would
still be there but we can try.

It's hard to tell what motivates Paul Krugman's frequent attacks on Enron (""Enron Goes Overboard"" August 17).  His latest attack is no more than a string of misstatements and non-sequitors reminiscent of a schoolyard taunt.  He reveals, in depth, his ignorance of Enron, the people who work here, and the tragically botched California regulatory regime.  Perhaps he seeks merely to entertain.

	The broader goal of his personal attack appears to be to discredit the free market system - a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect, and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of government controlled or sponsored monopolies to make choices for people.  We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.  Ironically, the example Krugman cites of ""financialization"" run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step.  Indeed, the only winners in the entire California fiasco were the government owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest, and British Columbia.  The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.  So long as Krugman's elitist reasoning prevails, we are doomed to repeat such mistakes.

Subject:	Joe Barton

Have Mr. Lay and Congressman Barton done their follow-up call about the Texas Senate race?  This conversation remains a priority with Joe.  In addition to Barton's solid efforts on our key issues, his change in viewpoint having been noted in the trade press, he has agreed to participate in the opening dinner panel at the Genie conference.  

I think it would be nice to work this out before the Genie conference next week.  If that's impossible for scheduling reasons, perhaps we could arrange time before the Genie dinner session when they could meet face to face.

I know Joe came away from his earlier conversation feeling good about it, and if Ken's inclination is to support him, it's probably better to do it sooner rather than later.  The secondary question that arises is, if Ken isn't comfortable with an endorsement, can Enron's PAC support the exploratory effort regardless?

	As a valued member of the RFF Council, we thought you might
appreciate knowing that Resources for the Future President Paul Portney
has been asked to appear on C-SPAN's ""Washington Journal"" this Wednesday
(August 15th) between 8am and 9am for a live, hour-long interview.

	It is a unique and unprecedented opportunity to enlighten a
national television audience about RFF itself - its mission, research,
history and future goals, much of which you have helped to support.

	C-SPAN's request for the interview followed intense media
coverage of Dr. Portney's work chairing the National Academy of Sciences
committee on fuel economy standards, and Katherine Probst's
widely-reported study on the future costs of Superfund.

	You can also access the interview online at www.c-span.org and
click on the live TV/radio programs icon at the top of the page.

	Thank you.

Dear Mr. Skilling,

On behalf of Mayor Willie L. Brown, Jr. (San Francisco), it is my
pleasure to invite you to meet with him regarding energy issues in
California.

Mayor Brown wishes to meet with you in his capacity as a trustee of the
Board of Administration of the California Public Employees Retirement
System (CalPERS).  As you know, CalPERS is the largest public pension fund
in the
nation and is a sizeable investor in domestic energy stocks, bonds,
debentures, etc.  The Board has appointed Mayor Brown to lead a
delegation of trustees to meet with the CEOs of CalPERS' largest energy
holdings.  Enron represents one such holding.

The Mayor would be pleased to host you in his office at the newly
renovated City Hall in San Francisco or arrange an alternative location at
your earliest convenience.  I
will await your response.

Sincerely,

Monique Moyer
Director, Mayor's Office of Public Finance
City & County of San Francisco

Hold on.  Dan and I discussed it, but it is not my call whether anyone other than EES bears those costs.  For what it's worth, I agreed with Dan that to the extent Tom and Ken had reached agreement regarding, among other things, Tom's use of the corporate aircraft for non-EES purposes, that it may not make sense to have EES bear those costs.  But it was clear in my conversation with Dan that it was not my call to make.

Just an observation and suggestion regarding the recent media blitz --- Make sure employees have access to Enron's side of the story via (additional) eBiz features or an e-speak feature with the Office of the Chairman when the 3rd quarter earnings are released.

I hear people talking about some of these articles (like the NY Times article this weekend and the Off Wall Street article a few weeks ago) and they don't know what to think.  The general employee population does not understand our financials and how Enron ""makes markets"". - At least this is my perception based on conversations that I hear in the elevators and on the bus on my to/from work.  

Anyway, my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside.

	We have completed the inspection of the GAA line to LaPaz, and everything looks OK.  We'll reinitiate gas flow tonight.  OSSA II should be completed tomorrow.  Army personnel continues to be patrolling the area, but things remain pretty calm, despite several areas in the country that are under roadblock by protesters.

	I'm going to keep things in emergency status until at least tomorrow, after today's roadblocks are lifted.  Will advise of any developments.

	Subject:        17/7 - 7:00 p.m. - Update: Emergency 

	The situation continues to be stable.  CLHB has reinitated LPG operations to LaPaz, but continue their inspection.  TR will not reinitiate gas or crude export operations until we have completed our inspection.  We have formed joint teams with CLHB and Army personnel to perform the inspection.  It could take as long as 48 hours, but we'll have a better estimate after we get a progress report in the morning.   All crews available systemwide are mobilizing for inspection of the entire system, but for now our priority continues to be the lines in the altiplano.  The three stations in the altiplano have been shut down, bled off, and locked.  Other supervisors throughout the system have been advised and are on alert.

	Government and regulator continue to be supportive of our shut-down and inspection action plan.  We have developed a contingency plan with COBEE (the regional electricity distributor) under which they will redistribute energy out of spare capacity in Cochabamba to LaPaz  - this should cover LaPaz's electricity needs during the duration of time we need to complete our inspection.  The only other significant consumer is a large cement plant in LaPaz.  We've agreed that they will slow down their operations, and provide only small, local supplies (industrial concrete demand will be shut-in).

	We did not send a press release on the issue, although we have received inquiries - our response is that we are concerned about the risk to Bolivians this action presented, and we are performing an inspection on the system.  We are avoiding mention of gas stoppage to LaPaz at this time, due to the volatility of the issue in LaPaz.  Government (VMEH, SIRESE) has agreed with the message.

	We expect that with the cement plant and power plant off-line, line pack should be sufficient to keep commercial demand satisfied for a few days.  In either event, we are working with the local gas distributor to prepare a notice for LaPaz newspapers instructing gas consumers in the area how to safely shut-down and restart their equipment in the event that it becomes necessary.

	The most likely scenario as of now is that Edwin Morales - a local revolutionary tied to the coca trade - is behind the action.  Morales has had contact in the past with the Raul Rocha bunch out of Chuquina (Oruro), so we're still not sure whether this was an act against TR and/or the industry, or if it is against government.  Morales has just joined forces with another rebel out of Cochabamba and is planning nationwide road blocks for tomorrow.  Their agenda is national - they've never isolated TR or our industry as a whole, although Chaco in the north have been targeted in the past, probably because they have a field in the middle of Morales' stronghold.  The political situation here is tenuous with Banzer out and various political interests looking to fill the leadership void.  We're watching this situation closely.  The local Army brigade has committed to staying on vigilance for at least the next few days - once we're comfortable with the operational situation, we'll discuss a longer-term solution.

	At 1:45 p.m. today, a CLHB line walker discovered a bomb on their LPG line in the Altiplano 14 km from out SicaSica station.  Our OSSA II (crude exports to Chile) and GAA (gas to LaPaz) share the same ROW, and would likely have been taken out with the bomb.  We understand that the bomb, which had a manual fuse, did not go off, but had been lit and failed to explode.  The Army has been mobilized to diffuse the bomb, and we consider the immediate threat neutralized.

	However, given that we have now seen several attempts in the last 10 days of sabotage against our lines, I have declared a state of EMERGENCY, and will notify the Enron Crisis team.

	We have shut all Altiplano pipeline operations down, and have mobilized a joint CLHB/TR/Army team to perform vigilance on the entire altiplano network.  The immediate result of this is that lights will likely start to go out in LaPaz within the next few hours - the GAA line is their primary power fuel supply.  I've notified all relevant government authorities of the situation, and so far am getting support.  I've also asked the Embassy to look into the situation, with the understanding that if this is the result of an organized movement, they might have access to intelligence that could be helpful.

	Additionally, we've shut down all non-critical maintenance operations throughtout the rest of the system, and are directing spare personnel to perform vigilance on the remainder of the system as quickly as possible.  Until and unless we have information that this threat goes beyond the altiplano, we will continue operations, with all stations on alert.  We will kick off the the total system inspection within the next few hours, as soon as our people complete the overall plan.

	I will keep you posted as things develop. 

	Steve

Dear Parents of 8th Grade Students,

I am now emailing you as the Social Justice teacher (my second hat).
Currently, your daughter is not taking Social Justice. Since I would not
be seeing you (as a Religion teacher) during Open House, I wanted to
provide you with my handout and classroom procedure sheet. I'm also
attaching information about the major project.

Steve -

We are beginning our planning for faculty recruiting for the fall of 
2002.  We tried hard this year to recruit a person for the finance (risk 
management) position and made an offer but he eventually chose to stay 
where he was for family reasons.  We will try again with him but will also 
widen the search again.

We will begin the search for the second Enron Professorship which was 
described as E-commerce.  Since we initially discussed this a lot has 
happened in the E-commerce world and we think it might be useful to 
re-designate the field a bit.  The use of the web and technology in 
business has become a critical part of the fundamental operations of the 
business and as we think that a professorship in operations management with 
a bent toward the use of the web and other related technologies might the 
educational needs of the students better and with better long term 
results.  Is this too far afield from the grant or do you think we would be 
in the general parameters?

Thanks.

Steve - below are the initial measures we believe we can take starting Wednesday.  The problem is guard force manpower.  The increased demands are so great now that the current force is working two 12 hour shifts instead of three 8 hour shifts.  We will be putting in a request for more guards in the next couple of days, but it takes 3 weeks for them to be hired and trained by the contractor.

Please feel free to edit the text as you see fit.  Also - would you like the email to come from you, the Office of the Chairman, or business controls? 

Text of Message:

Due to recent events, Enron will be increasing security at its facilities around the world.  As part of this increased security effort, beginning Wednesday morning, September 26, the following access control procedures will be instituted at the Enron Building in Houston and, where applicable, at other Enron facilities:

	As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron Building, a guard will match the photo on 	the badge to the bearer.

	All employees will be required to display their badges while in any Enron facility.  The badge must be attached to 	the front of the employee at some point between the waist and the shoulders.

	Employees who forget their badges must present a valid picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Building (U.S. 	driver's	 license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification). 

	Visitors to the Enron Building must produce a valid photo ID when signing in at the lobby reception desk and must 	completely fill out the visitor card.  Visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, 	or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identification) will not be allowed access to the Enron Building.

	Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or badged contractor at all times.

	Visitors to the Enron Building will be met in the lobby by an Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a 	visitor's log at 	the lobby reception area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointment.  	At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to the lobby by an employee or badged 	contractor, the visitor badge collected, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the 	escorting employee or badged contractor.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instituted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equipment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees.

Subject:	California Amendments DEFEATED!

John Shelk will provide a more thorough report in a later Email, but I just wanted you to know that the Waxman price cap amendment was just defeated in full Committee markup and the Eshoo refund amendment was defeated.  Both by sizable margins.

   Subject:  Security Update


   Enron  has  been increasing security at its facilities around the world.
   Some  of  the  changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security
   personnel)  and  some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will
   be  visible,  there  are  a  few  that  will  have an impact on everyday
   activities.   In  all  the steps we take and recommendations we make, we
   will be making our facilities and systems more secure and endeavoring to
   increase  your  sense  of  security,  while  doing  our best to minimize
   disruption to our day-to-day business.

   Primary  responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business
   controls  organization.  You can contact this organization through their
   website  (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or
   by                   email                  (CorporateSecurity@enron.com
   <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).   John  Brindle, Senior Director,
   Business Controls, leads this organization.  Please feel free to provide
   John  and  his  team  with  your  comments  and  questions, or to report
   security threats.

   We  have  two  areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures
   for  the  Enron  Center  Campus  in  Houston  and  changes to our travel
   advisory.

   Access to the Enron Center

   Over  the next few days, the following access control procedures will be
   instituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

        ?  As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the
           Enron  Center,  a guard will match the photo on the badge to the
           bearer.

        ?  Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a
           valid  picture  ID  to  obtain  access to the Enron Center (U.S.
           driver's license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S.
           federal, state or local identification).

        ?   Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when
           signing  in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill
           out  the  visitor card.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID
           (U.S.  driver's  license, U.S. or foreign passport, or some form
           of  U.S.  federal,  state  or  local identification) will not be
           allowed access to the Enron Center.

        ?   Visitors  to  Enron  facilities  must  be  escorted by an Enron
           employee or badged contractor at all times.

        ?   Visitors  to  the  Enron  Center will be met in the lobby by an
           Enron employee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log
           at   the   lobby  reception  area  by  the  employee  or  badged
           contractor,   and   escorted   to  their  appointment.   At  the
           conclusion  of  the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to
           the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge
           collected,  and  the  visitor signed out in the log at the plaza
           reception area by the escorting employee or badged contractor.

        ?  Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of
           their workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious
           activity  to  Security (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors
           for  individuals  unknown  to  you  or hold doors open, allowing
           ""tail gating"" by others.

   These  will  be  the  first in a series of new security procedures to be
   instituted  at  Enron.   We  ask  that  all  employees be patient during
   congested  times in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard
   personnel  and  equipment,  we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We
   hope you understand these measures are being instituted for the security
   of all our employees.


   Travel Advisory Update

   With  the  beginning  of  retaliatory  strikes,  we  have  two important
   recommendations:

        ?   While  the  retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security
           recommends that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.
           We  continue  to  strongly recommend that all travel during this
           time  to  Afghanistan,  Yemen,  Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
           Sudan,  Somalia,  Tajikistan,  Turkmenistan,  Georgia,  and  the
           Kyrgyz  Republic  be  canceled.   In addition, we recommend that
           planned   travel  to  Egypt,  Israel,  Gaza/West  Bank,  Jordan,
           Lebanon,  Saudi  Arabia,  Syria,  and  Algeria be very carefully
           considered.

        ?   For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate
           security  recommends  that  you carry documentation.  There have
           been  several  recent reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in
           the  United  States being questioned and asked for documentation
           when  boarding  U.S.  domestic  flights. As a result, we suggest
           that  all  non-U.S.  citizens who currently reside in the United
           States  -  and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status -
           carry their passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We
           would  also  suggest  that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their
           Permanent  Resident  (Green)  Card as proof of their status as a
           precautionary  measure.   It  appears that Immigration Officials
           may be applying a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act
           that  requires  individuals  over the age of 18 to carry his/her
           ""registration""  documentation  with  them at all times. This can
           include  a  Permanent  Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment
           Authorization   Card,  Border  Crossing  Card,  or  a  Temporary
           Resident  Card. Immigration Officials have not historically been
           asking  domestic travelers for ""registration"" documentation, but
           in  light  of  the  heightened  security  measures  and  current
           atmosphere,  it  would  be  best to be prepared with all of your
           documentation proving your current lawful status.

   We  will  keep  you  apprised of new information and developments on the
   Corporate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Good news.  As you indicated would happen, Kalen Pieper called me mid-week.  We had a very good conversation about EES and Dave Delainey's leadership.  She explored my views about doing business with government.  Shortly thereafter, Dave's office called to invite me to Houston on Thursday July 26.  
 
Kay Chapman explained that Dave's schedule would keep him out of pocket until August 16.  In order to move forward, Janet Dietrich will be meeting with me when I go to Houston next Thursday.  (I must confess that after all the great things I have heard about the man, I do look forward to meeting Dave himself.)
 
Is there a time next week that I can speak with you by phone to fine-tune my thinking / preparation for Thursday's meeting with Janet?
 
Thank you for your all of your help.  I am pleased and appreciative that things are moving forward at a good clip.  
 
Kevin

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Potential Dynegy Transactions


Steve,
 
I think you may have heard a request last week re working closely with Dynegy.  I think we just need to treat them like other counterparties.  Basically, West Power would like to enter into arms length physical power and service transactions with Dynegy.  My understanding is that Dynegy is a separate, unrelated party until the merger closes.  Therefore, we can not ""collaborate"" with them commercially and our transaction policy is dictated by customary credit, legal and risk management procedures.  Is this correct?   If so, how do you feel about the following?
 
An Enron customer wants to buy power and related services for one year.  The customer requires Enron to post collateral.  Enron does not want to post collateral but suggests that Enron can provide the product/services to Dynegy and Dynegy can then sell to the customer.  The Enron marketer calls the Dynegy marketer and proposes a ""back to back"" transaction.   Dynegy adds a small service fee, the Enron/Dynegy contract is executed and a Dynegy/Customer contract is executed.  
 
This type of deal happens frequently - it is usually driven by the third party having better credit, transmission access or a complementary service.  We could do this with anyone, but the obvious choice is Dynegy - customers think it makes sense, and ultimately if we merge we have retained a customer.  
 
Do you think this works?
 
Regards,
 
Chris

--Steve- Did you get my earlier email re: this last week?

Ken


I found out at a meeting last Wednesday from an employee of another department that my title had changed from Manager to Sr. Specialist in the Expertfinder. I returned to the office and found this to be true. I called Joann Hill in Corporate HR and met with her on Friday. She advised me that there had been a study which re-classified several of us on EPSC. We were not informed prior to this happening. I was further frustrated because when I was transitioned to this department in April . I met with Bill Donovan and Lou Casari and was told that nothing would change about my title or responsibilities. EBS would be my primary client and I would be charged back 100%. When I was transferred my team was assigned to managers already in the department. I was not told that my title was in jeopardy. I am still responsible for Julie Stockham as a report in Portland although she is in Phillip Lord' s cost center. Joann was very gracious and agreed to investigate and let me know.

This is a setback I had not anticipated especially after John Echols ad advised me I was next for promotion

Thanks for your support.

Some further questions:
 


Are we required to have a formal severance plan?  Can we opt not to have a severance plan and simply handle matters on a case-by-case basis (perhaps with ""rule of thumb"" guidelines)?

If we are required to have such a plan, should we centrally administer the plan to avoid inconsistencies?

My original message regarding the employee involved was raising a somewhat broader concern.  Perhaps because our plans are complicated, we have had occasions where an employee was told something, what he/she was told was incorrect, he/she changed position based on what he/she was told, and then we made the employee bear the risk of the mistake.  Obviously, the right answer is to get it right the first time, but on those occasions where we made the mistake, do we have the flexibility to fix it?

Subject:	Enron Net Works 2002 Budget Process

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, ""in progress"" or ""planned"" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

Federal price limits backfire 
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps 
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer 
Wednesday, July 4, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle  
URL: http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/07/04/MN186091.DTL  
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of blackouts in the two states. 
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and reduce air conditioning. 
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during shortages. 
""We need some clarity to this order,"" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of dollars to keep the state's lights on. 
""Generators need to be held accountable,"" he said. 
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates during periods of high demand. 
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost. 
""No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps,"" said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an energy-industry association in Menlo Park. 
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls are in effect. 
""This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not having enough,"" Ackerman said. ""It increases the threat of blackouts."" 
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert about an hour later, after finding additional supplies. 
""Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts,"" said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power network. 
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their lights. 
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in exacerbating Monday's shortage. 
""We're looking very closely at this,"" he said. ""There seems to be a potential for unintended consequences."" 
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less- efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing, under capped prices. 
""We're going to see how the caps might have played into this,"" he said. 
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92 per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101. 
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have extended California's power crisis to neighboring states. 
""California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus,"" he said. 
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES' 
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot withhold output. 
""The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"" said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources. 
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply and demand determine costs. 
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies. 
""No one answered,"" he said. ""They were closed."" 
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for when the commission might come up with a response.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001) 
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices, generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said. 
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Stage 1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the first time since they went into effect June 21. 
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity for the state's financially distressed utilities. 
""They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusion over the FERC order,"" Hidalgo said. ""We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."" 
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said. Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada. 
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity. And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap will fall could lead to unexpected shortages. 
""That's the risk that you run (with price controls),"" said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. ""People want any kind of certainty at all."" 
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute imports from the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts are ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon. 
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8. 
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient plant operating in California during a ""power alert"" declared by the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid. When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was established during the latest alert. 
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour in California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7 percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said. 
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew by how much until the price was posted by the ISO. 
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $98 in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a credit risk in selling to the state. 
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every time the ISO declares a power alert. 
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. But out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs 
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it. 

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer 

     SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
     The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the state's electricity since January.
     At least five companies producing or marketing power ""are telling us that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy,"" Hart said.
     The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency, meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since May 31.
     Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona. 
     The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
     But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently drove away sellers, Hart said.
     Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
     Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and when it should take effect. They got no answer.
     Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
     Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.
     Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this summer.
     ""Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through,"" Hart said.

"RE: Stock Price","Starting July 1 we implemented cost savings initiatives designed to reduce Enron's cost structure by over $200 million on an annual basis.  Additionally there has been a substantial amount of restructuring in both EBS and in EES to reduce costs and refocus our business on high value opportunities.  As Ken has said, though, the basic business model and strategy of Enron is sound and promises continued growth -- no changes there.  For example, in the Enron Industrial Markets and Enron Global Markets groups -- efforts begun just over a year ago -- we have already experienced enormous volume and revenue growth and we are making money already in these ""first mover"" businesses.  Successes like these prove the advantages of our overall strategy and business model.  Combined with some long overdue focus on costs, we should be well on our way to even greater gains in recurring earnings.

Mr. Skilling consistently stated over the past few months that we needed to ""earn our way"" to a higher stock price.  Following his departure, Mr. Lay has stated that one of his top priorities would be to rebuild our stock value.  My question is, will the company have any changes to existing policies in order to facilitate this growth?  Will company spending (Teaming events, Travel and Expense Policy, Investment in new technology, and so on) be cut back in order to bolster earnings?  Basically, do we have a new gameplan (aside from the EBS restructuring) or will we proceed forward and operate as we have been.

Subject:	California Update--09.17.01

Here is some additional information since the circus closed down in Sacramento on Saturday morning.					

The Senate adjourned early Saturday morning, closing out both the regular session and the second extraordinary session.
The Assembly adjourned a few hours later, closing the regular session, but NOT the second extraordinary session.

The Legislature's options: 
1) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, they continue with the second extraordinary session, and pick up where they left off with the bills they were working on up till Saturday morning.
2) The Governor calls them back in two weeks, the Assembly ends the second extraordinary session, they begin a third extraordinary session, and the bills that were left hanging on Saturday morning must start the process from scratch.  However, they can pass a ""waiver,"" which effectively would allow them to start a 3rd session AND then pick up where they left off on Saturday morning.
3) The Governor calls them back in two weeks and the Legislature meets briefly and shuts down without doing anything, i.e., the Govenor can call them back, but he can't make them vote.

In short, the Legislature has a significant amount of discretion to do what they please.

Where to from here?
Through its actions on Saturday morning, the Senate has sent a strong signal to Davis that the Senate is not inclined to vote out an Edison bailout that differs from the version it passed prior to leaving for summer recess last July.
Just before closing down on Saturday, the Senate also passed a resolution declaring that ""...the condition of electric service in California no longer consitutes a 'sudden and severe energy shortage'"" and ""...that the state of emergency proclaimed by the Governor on January 17, 2001, is at and end.""  The resolution seems to send an additional signal that the Senate does not see any great need to bail out Edison.  The Assembly did not pass the resolution, however.  
Given the Senate's view, and the open hositility between Davis and Burton, Davis' only remaining option seems to be to threaten the Senate with vetoes unless the Senate first passes the Davis' Edison bill.  It is unclear at this time whether Davis would play it that tough.
With the Legislature gone, the action turns to the PUC, where a vote on DA suspension is scheduled for Thursday.  We are working with customers and providers to stop DA from being suspended, or at a minimum, to ensure that any suspension date is not retroactive.
Finally, Burton held a news conference this morning at which he said:
Burton and Senator Bowen (Bowen's been taking the lead on DA in the Senate) will ask the California PUC to do a study on how DA can be retained without ""adversely affecting homeowners and small businesses.""
He doesn't know why ""the Governor would waste taxpayers' money to hold a special session.""
With all the troubled businesses in California right now, he doesn't know why the State would bail Edison out and not the others.

If all this sounds ridiculous, it is.

We'll report back with additional information as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Mr. Lay,

I am writing to you this afternoon because I am concerned for the safety of me and my coworkers here at Enron.  In light of the recent events that have happened I am worried that security here at Enron is still lacking.  I only say this because just this morning I forgot my Enron badge, so I had to get a guest pass, this of course is not a big deal and happens all the time.  However, I had my backpack with me like usual and nobody seemed to even raise an eyebrow.  Now obviously I pose zero threat to Enron but I feel like somebody who walks in with a guest pass needs only a drivers license, which hasn't been a problem for most terrorists to acquire, of somebody who works here at Enron.  Can you see where I am going with this?  

Anyway, I'm a first year analyst and this whole event makes me more and more nervous as time progresses and the events unfold.  I only come to you with this concern because I am not the only one of my friends who have mentioned it.  Please take this into consideration and know that I only raise this issue for the safety of everybody.

Sincerely,

		Subject:	Algebra Information

		Dear Algebra Students,

		You successfully completed Trimester I, and we're headed
into Trimester II. As I'm sure you've already noticed, the material is
getting more and more challenging. You should also be aware that I will
be expecting more and more higher level thinking as the year progresses.
The Unit 4 Test is a good example of the thinking skills that I'd like
to see. The multiple choice questions were quite challenging and
required that you apply what we'd learned. Although the class average
was 73 on this test, and many of you scored lower than you normally do,
I think that we have to give ourselves credit for ""passing"" such a
challenging test. The best news is that your portfolio grades will more
than make up for a lower test score. One might say that I even planned
it that way. :-) Now, we have to get ready for the next test. It will be
a similar test in style and difficulty, and we won't be doing a
portfolio. So, you should take the Unit 4 Test and study the type of
questions that you missed. Don't worry...I know you can handle this! By
the end of the year, you will be a superb test taker and algebraist!

		PS: Don't forget to discuss your Unit 4 Test score with
your parents. They had to take challenging tests in their day (:-)), and
they can help you prepare for the types of questions (even if they've
forgotten some of the math).

		Mrs. Ward

Steve,
I am very disappointed to learn that you will leave the company.  I remember you as that real go-getter who learns new words each week.  During our trip to Dubuque, the word was ""elect"" and I have elected to adopt that term many times since.  You have remained a bright light to me as I followed your success.  I am saddened that you will be some place else.  But you will always be a friend.

We've got a lot of exposure at Wharton already and I'd just assume save a request for your time for a more strategic opportunity.

With heightened security concern in the building this morning, I wanted to report two items:

1. When I parked in the Allen Center Garage this morning, level 7 yellow section (at the top of the stairs from the Enron building, just under the covered area), I noticed a large brown/copper truck.  I park my blue explorer in this same spot every day and I have never seen this truck before.  It's probably nothing, just wanted to report it.

2. When I reached my desk this morning I wanted to call in this concern.  I pulled up the corporate security number listed on the website 713-435-2804.  The woman that answered the phone was rude and said that the number wasn't corporate security, but rather building security -- she laughed and didn't seem remotely interested in my concern.  Perhaps, I misunderstood the website posting about who to call with security concerns.  But, if I did, perhaps other employees will as well....

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns that the legislation will unduly delay the development of the competitive wholesale power markets that provide consumer savings and reliable power supplies.  The process underway at FERC is on track to produce substantial benefits, and should be allowed to continue unhindered, not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

We should get the focus off of ""micromanaging FERC"".  This isn't about a federal agency; this is about which approach will produce the best outcome for consumers and our message needs to be couched in those terms.  Obviously, our view is that FERC's approach, at least so far, appears most likely to produce the kind of market which will ensure reliable, secure and affordable power. 

 I like the ""gerrymandering"" message.  A process dependent on compromise (eg a legislative body like congress) is going to produce a ""camel"" and that won't work for customers.  Truth be told it was this same kind of compromised, political, consensus-building exercise which produced AB 1890 and the resulting debacle in California's energy market.

Key question: is the ""electricity gerrymandering"" too tough?

While we're encouraged that Cong. Barton has mandated RTO participation for all transmitting utilities, we have serious concerns with the micromanagement of the FERC.  The process underway at FERC is working well, and should be allowed to continue unhindered.  Properly configured RTOs are essential to competitive wholesale power markets and the corresponding consumer benefits, and must not fall victim to electricity gerrymandering.

We look forward to working with Congressman Barton and the committee as this process moves ahead.

Subject:	Supported Internet Email Addresses

Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.
Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.
To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.
IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.
We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.
Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Good afternoon Mr Kean,

The reason for contacting you today is that I am currently working a senior
US executive based in the UK.  I am confident he could prove to be a
valuable asset to the Enron Corporation.

Currently residing in London, he is now looking to make a career move which
will utilise his honed management style, and experience of developing
commercial business.  

At the moment he is the Group Managing Director of Europe's largest Telecoms
Support business which has a turnover in excess of ?1 billion.

You were in a meeting yesterday evening,  but I wanted to investigate
whether you would like to see a narrative profile of this gentleman.

Your initial thoughts would be most welcome, I look forward to hearing from
you at your convenience.

Redraft (confirm):

	Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.

	Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Subject:  Increased Security at Enron Centers

	Late on 25 October, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Building.  We are in touch with local law enforcement authorities who have informed us that this threat remains unsubstantiated.   Nonetheless, we take all threats seriously as the security of our employees and facitlites is paramount.  Therefore, we have increased the security posture at the Enron Centers, including an increased HPD presence.  

	We will keep all employees apprised of any new developments as they occur.

Subject:	Northeast RTO Mediation Report

Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is ""subject to extension"" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a ""business plan"" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years (""Option 1-M""of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years (""Option 2-M"" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 (""Option 3-M"" of the Business Plan).  

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.  

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining ""Best Practices.""  Although PJM also conducted a ""best practices"" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are ""best practices.""  

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) ""far outstrips"" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that ""impatience, haste and greed"" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process ""at the expense of sound policy"" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to ""exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint."" See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).  

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.  

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.  

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom

A couple of clarifications:

The $800 million of proceeds from asset sales does not include Azurix NA ( that cash goes to Azuirx, not Enron).
PGE sale - not $2 billion in PS;  $200 million in PS and $50 million in common stock
The investor call was extended to 8:30 t0 10:00 am and will focus more on the current business and financial stituation at Enron rather than the 8K filed last week.

Questions of the Day

?	Liquidity and counterparty activity.  Transaction count on EnronOnline (media and investors)

For the past two years, Enron has used 30-day rolling averages for daily transaction counts and notional value for our wholesale trading activities on EnronOnline due to the normal variability in these numbers on a day-to-day basis.  Due to the unusual events of the last few weeks, we provided some daily information.  However, we intend to again use rolling averages in all communications going forward.  While we saw some decrease in volumes on EnronOnline at the end of last week due to the impending merger announcement, volumes have returned to a normal range and are holding steady at a rolling average of 5,800 transactions with a notional value of $2.7 billion. 


?	Quantification of litigation (media and investors)
o	no specific comment on litigation
o	shareholder suits likely to be consolidated
o	$3.5 billion ""basket"" in merger agreement is designed to cover all Enron litigation (i.e. not just shareholder litigation) and the parties believe this will be sufficient

?	Ken Lay's compensation (media and employees)
o	Ken, like many CEOs, has a change in control provision in his contract (and has had one for many years)
o	Ken has elected to waive his right to payment under that provision


Messages of the Day

?	Impact of merger on asset sales transactions (e.g. Dabhol) (media) 

Enron will continue with our asset sales program as previously announced.  Those asset sales that have been announced include EcoElectrica, CEG/CEG Rio, EOGIL and Portland General Electric, as well as Azurix North America, which closed on November 7.  These transactions total $800 million plus PGE ($1.55 billion cash, $2 billion in preferred stock and $1.1 billion in debt)

?	Timing of funding from Chevron (banks and rating agencies)
o	Obligation - 3 business days after filing HSR (expected today), expect funding to occur earlier

?	Impact of transaction on specific areas (e.g. Portland, Japan, Florida and other office locations) - case by case
