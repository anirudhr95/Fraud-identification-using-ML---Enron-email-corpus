This is operational stuff I received from the Power Pool.  

I seem to be receiving a lot of this kind of stuff and I think it is now appropriate for Enron to change our designated contact person with the Power Pool from me to someone who is more operationally focused.  Please let me know who you want to do that and I will advise the Power Pool of the change.

 -----Original Message-----
From: 	Zufferli, John

To:	Lavorato, John
Subject:	Alberta Power vs MID-C

I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.

In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that
tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to 
11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.

I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  

The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be:
			a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak
			b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge)
			c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis

See what you think??

Given the volatility in the gas market (which is the sole impact on the Canadian power book's US dollar exposure) and the exhorbitant cost involved in hedging multi-year cashflows (i.e. as evidenced by Friday 10/19/2001 trade of -$1,200,000 Cdn new deal value for the 14 year swap that I entered into), I will manage the currency exposure of this book myself, I will hedge appropriately when I see fit and will not accept hedges forced on Enron Canada because of arbitrary position limits set by your department.

up ADMS dispatches with a voice confirmation unless a ADMS message has timed
out because of technical difficulties or the System Controllers have been
notified that a participant is having technical difficulties receiving ADMS
dispatches and directives.

The time out period will be adjusted from the 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We
intend to further reduce the time out to 2 minutes following a reasonable
delay and reassessment based on our operating experience.

We are currently reevaluating the ADMS dispatch procedures with regards to
the Interconnections. Any changes to the Interconnection procedures will be
conveyed to participants well in advance of implementation.

Thanks to all of you for your patience during our implementation of this
valuable new tool.

Subject:	2001 Management Conference


During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

In addition to my prior e-mail, I have already had an interview with John Zufferli, John Disturnal, Mike Cowan, and Chris Lambie on September 13, 2001.  The interview lasted for 3 hours!  I have not heard back from any of them yet.  Just wondering, would that then be considered as my first round of interview, or would that be already my ""Super Thursday (Saturday)""?

I would also like to thank you for putting me as one of the potential candidates.  I have attached a copy of my updated resume and a copy of my online academic record.  My GPA is back to where I used to be, around the 3.3 range.  Let me know if you would like me to fax in a transcript to you as well.

If you would like more information, please don't hesitate call me at 605.7568 (cell) or e-mail me at school vbleung@ucalgary.ca.

   Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he
   has
   a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to
   speak
   to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from
   Calgary
   and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants
   general
   info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
   should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give
   him
   your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?

"RE:","Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80% of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not be 
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have to move back to the 
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared the the new Enron deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the best solution in the long run.

Hi John,

Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was
talking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I don't
want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just trying
to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would never
want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank at
a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I can
avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs
and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to come
up with the $55K for the down payment.

If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a stable
investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7
years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long
while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing
within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either
way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?

Hi everyone,

I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P&L #'s right, if nothing were done the month end P&L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made. Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for.

Let me know if one of you could help me do this.

The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608. I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money. Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts? The liq value for the call is CORRECT.

"RE: p/l adj due to option liquidations","Your numbers amount to a adjustment of (1,746,675), were the total 2nd order from Jun 29 was (1,891,851), now I understand that I would receive a some negative 2nd order to explain some of this difference I just thought that (145,176) difference (i.e. (1,891,851-1,746675) which should be the true 2nd order) was a bit high.

Subject:	p/l adj due to option liquidations

I wanted to update you on what we have found regarding the liquidations for the financial options and the 2nd order. The problem began at the end of June when coding in enpower was changed for how the delta was reported for put options only. This change to the delta did not carry through to the liquidation values for and as a result the options were liquidating showing a loss instead of a gain. This resulted in large losses in 2nd order because the p/l that could not be explained due to the incorrect liquidations was placed there. The IT group is working to fix the problem which should be done in the next day or two. Until then, Karim and myself will manually reflect the correct liquidations and p/l in the DPR until Enpower is fixed going forward starting with July 18th p/l.

Karim and I have figured the p/l adjustment that needs to be made for July and the last day of June. The total adjustment is $1,746,675 as follows:

July = $1,529,869 (July 1 - 17)
June 29th = $216,806  

The July adj was captured on July 17th p/l. The June adjustment needs to be captured as PMA adjustment. As result of the DPR being incorrect for June against the financial liquidations report, the liq rec should be out of balance by at least the adjustment noted above. An FYI for accounting, the financial liquidations report is reporting the correct liquidations numbers for any financial put options!!! The problem lies within the Enpower portcalc not the Financial liq report and that is why the lic rec should be out of balance.

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Subject:	Etag 1.7 Training

I was looking in to the up-coming training sessions for the new etag system that OATI is rolling out on October 25, 2001.  They have two different training sessions, a one day workshop that is for experienced users and does not include any hands-on training, and a two day training session that includes hands-on training.  The two day session however, includes a second day of training on NERC Policy 9 regarding congestion management that may not be overly important to Calgary operations.

OATI says that version 1.7 is drastically different from the current software and training is highly recommended.  I was thinking that it would be a good idea to send one of us to the 2-day training session and then that person could pass on the information to the other 3.  I think, by the sounds of it, we would only need to attend one day since the second day deals with the NERC policy for the eastern interconnect only.

There is a training session that runs on October 1-2 in Minneapolis.  I am off those days, and would be more then happy to attend.  I can take care of all the registration and travel planning with Angela if you would like.

The cost of the session is $250 for 2 days, or $150 for the first day only.  There are only 8 spots left for this session.

Let me know what you think.

Mike

John,

I just got of the phone with Postlethwaite and he said we will make the adjustment tommorow morning before the final dpr #'s, the correction should add approx. $1.5 million in P&L.  Sorry for the delay in resolving the issue.

I also found out that you had no liquidations in June
and had $22,000 in liquidations in May in your options book (these amounts do not take into consideration any premiums)

Do these #'s seem right to you??? ( I am going off what Postlethwaite has told me).

Hi everyone,

I just got of the phone with Hai and he told me how to make an adjustment on a day to day basis in regards to incorrect liquidations but he also explained this is just to make the daily P&L #'s right, if nothing were done the month end P&L would still somehow work out because adjustments would be made. Does this mean that for June and for a certain portion of July we should not do anything and just make adjustments on a going forward basis (and assume everything will work out at month end)?
If this is the case I would like someone to walk me through June to see if the numbers did really work themselves out as there was a large swing in second order on June 29 that was not adjusted for.

Let me know if one of you could help me do this.
Karim.

Evidently, this a problem that Stacey White has been aware of for a couple of months now. There was a change made in the coding for the delta position and this has somehow messed up the liq value.

John, Karim,

I'm now looking closely at the option liquidation problems. I believe that there might be a sign-flipping problem for PUTS that 's causing this whole issue. I'll keep you posted.
Karim - this's likely the explanation to your other question... I'll get back to you as soon as I have more info (hopefully later today)

The post id I am looking at for Calgary is 11608. I am looking at the option liquidation report and all of the $65 puts are in the money and the $75 call is also in the money. Shouldn't all the liquidation values from the beginning of the month be a negative (representing positive liquidation) for the puts? The liq value for the call is CORRECT.

John

As most of you know, American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston to Los Angeles was hijacked yesterday and then crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center in New York.  We are very sorry to report that we believe an Enron employee was on board that flight.   Nick Humber, a director in Enron Wind's commercial origination group, was listed on the flight's manifest, and although his family has not received official confirmation that he boarded the flight, they have been unable to contact him.  Nick was based in Boston and was traveling to Los Angeles for a meeting.  We have talked with Nick's family and offered our full support.  Please continue to keep Nick's family and everyone affected by this horrific event in your thoughts and prayers.

Chili and Cheddar Bow Tie Casserole
 
1 (7oz) can chipotle chiles in adobo  sauce
1 tablespoon butter
1 cup chopped red bell pepper
1/2 cup diced Canadian bacon (about 2  oz)
1 cup thinly sliced green onions
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
2 1/4 cups 2% reduced-fat milk
2 cups (8 oz) shredded reduced-fat sharp cheddar  cheese
2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro
8 cups hot cooked farfalle (bow tie pasta) or other  short pasta
Cooking spray
 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees
 
Remove 1 teaspoon adobo sauce and 1 chile from  canned chiles; mince the chile.  Place remaining sauce and chiles in a  zip-top plastic bag and freeze for future use.
 
Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium-high  heat.  Add bell pepper and bacon; saut? 4 minutes.  Add onions; saut?  1 minute.  Stir in the adobo sauce, minced chile, flour, chili powder, salt  and cumin; cook 1 minute.  Gradually add milk; cook until thick and bubbly  (about 4 minutes), stirring constantly with a whisk.  Remove from  heat.  Gradually add 1 1/2 cups cheese and cilantro, stirring until cheese  melts.  Add pasta to pan; toss well.
 
Spoon the pasta mixture into a 11x7-inch baking  dish coated with cooking spray.  Sprinkle 1/2 cup cheese over pasta  mixture.  Bake at 400 degrees for 15 mins or until browned.   Yield:  6 servings
 
 
Cooks note:  I could not find the prepared can  of whole chiles with the sauce so I just used the can of diced green chiles I  found in the Mexican food isle and threw in what looked to be the right  amount.
 
Enjoy!

Subject: Management Conference - San Antonio, Texas - November 14-16, 2001
Importance: High



 
It is apparent that the recent September 11th terrorist attacks in the United States has caused havoc in the airline industry with cancelled flights and the rescheduling of numerous flights.  In this regard, I am now looking into chartering a flight from Calgary to San Antonio (and back to Calgary, of course) for the staff invited to the management conference in November.  Could you kindly confirm whether you will be attending the management conference in San Antonio in order that I may provide this information to the airline charter companies with respect to selecting the appropriate sized aircraft.  
 
Paul, I am not sure if you would like to join the individuals travelling from Calgary or if you would prefer to fly directly from Toronto.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Regards, Nella 

PS:  I would suggest that anyone who has already booked their flights to cancel same.

We expect to be in position to sign the purchase documents upon completion of the auction scheduled for Thursday, January 10, 2002.  Unfortunately, that means we need your responses to the questionnaire as soon as possible, and in no event later than 4:00 p.m. of January 10, 2002.

 
Regards,

Mark E. Haedicke

"Alberta Power vs MID-C","I sent you an update of the Hedge Summary for July 3, 2001.

In that I mentioned that I bought 125 MW of Cal02 at 10 HR flat.  I am long over 500 MW at this heat rate.  The biggest risk in this position is a large hydro year that
tanks the Mid-C (i.e. uncorrelated event with gas).  Mid-C off-peak is $47 USD, Nymex fixed price for Cal02 is $3.79 USD and Sumas basis is $0.16 for Cal02.  This implies a heat rate of close to 
11.9 for the off-peak Mid-C.

I am thinking about buying back some AECO gas hedge for Cal02, then selling Mid-C off-peak to replace the gas hedge.  Perhaps as winter blow-out protection, buy some Jan-Feb Sumas basis.  

The trade for a 25 MW long Alberta flat position would be:
			a) sell 25 MW of Mid-C off-peak
			b) buy 0.25 contracts /day of AECO fixed price Cal02 gas (i.e. to unwind the off-peak Alberta portion of the the gas hedge)
			c) buy 0.25 contracts/day of Sumas Jan-Feb basis

See what you think??

Mine is just simply a case of Enron paying under market because they could in the past.  I don't believe that is the case anymore.  Two years ago I was willing to accept less than market to see behind the curtain, but that is no longer the case.  I am not saying that it needs to be in the UBS document, but I would need your word you would do everything in your power to fix it.  If you can honestly tell me that I am paid the max. that is available to Directors I will drop it.

Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in Houston.  Not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 USD/year lower than what other shops are offering.  However, after three attempts, I have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.

Zuff

Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.

Chris.

Subject:	APMA Meeting Banff


Alberta Power Markets Association (APMA),  Banff Meeting, September 7, 2001

Location:
Rocky Mountain Resort, Banff
Summit Room (Main Building)

Agenda:
9:00      Coffee
9:30      Opening remarks
10:00     Discussion of the Alberta Power Market with the Minister of
Energy, Murray Smith
11:30     Move to Banff Springs Club House
11:45     Lunch (optional)
12:40     First Tee Time

Note about the meeting:
Our suggestion regarding the tone of this meeting is to forge a stronger
relationship between the market (the members of the APMA) and the
Government (the Honorable Minister of Energy Murray Smith).  The meeting
has been positioned with the minister's office as a discussion forum around
certain key fundamental topics (see points 1 to 4 below)

If you would like to discuss other topics that interest your company please
feel free to air these issues in the discussion.

We are suggesting that everything discussed in this form is held ""off the
record""

Directions:
From Calgary, follow the Trans Canada Highway West to the first Banff exit
(Banff/Lake Minnewanka sign).
Turn left onto Banff Avenue and proceed towards downtown Banff.
The Banff Rocky Mountain Resort is the first hotel on the left, at the
corner of Banff Avenue and Tunnel Mountain Road.


Business casual or golf attire


Potential subjects, as relayed to the minister's office:

1. What is the Government planning to do with the Electricity market?

Over the past 12 months intervention by the government and governmental
agencies drastically affected the market for electricity.  These actions
caused dramatic sudden changes in forward market prices.  The APMA members
are concerned that this behavior (often given the idiom 'reactionary
regulation') will persist.

2. What is the Governments view on transmission lines to the US markets?

The prospect of transmission lines that would directly connect the Alberta
market with US market is an interesting subject to most power marketers.
What is the current position of the government on the how the building,
owning and marketing of these hypothetical transmission lines would work in
the new market?

3. What is the government planning to with the remaining unsold PPA?

Last years decision by the Balancing Pool to sell energy from the unsold
Power Purchase Arrangements in a single auction dramatically affected the
forward market for electricity.  With the balancing pool still the
custodian of the unsold PPAs ? What is the plan going forward for the
release of the unsold PPAs into the market.

Subject: High 2nd order for deal 638008 - July 6 X July 5


The following is a summary of our findings regarding the high 2nd order for option deal 638008 , effective date July 6, previous date July 5:

The total deal daily change: -172899 is correct.
The historical greeks and curve shift are correct. They add up to -62084
The daily liquidation value  [196872] is not correct, and is pushing the 2nd order to a very high (highly negative) amount. Upon examining the option liquidation report, we find that there is $43680 in liquidation and $153192 in expiring options. 
This totals to $196872. The issue is, the expiring options are no longer part of the option's effective date value, and they were part of the previous date's value (since they hadn't expired yet). Therefore, the liquidation values should be:
Liq: $43680
Expired: -$153198

which totals to a negative value of -109512. If we use this value (-109512) in the daily liquidation column (which arguably could be split between liquidation and expiry) instead of the current value (196872), which results in a second order value of -1297.

We are still discussing the causes and implications of this issue. Please let us know if you have any further questions or if you have any issues with this explanation.

Here is the hedge summary for July 3/01.

Two things to note are: 	1) I bought 125 MW of Cal 02 flat from Mirant for a 10 GJ/MWh heat rate
			2) There is now a 20 year AECO basis curve, so the fixed price AECO gas from cal 15 on is generated off this curve.  Before the AECO basis

Subject:	Nortel


Not sure if you have seen this or not, but I thought it was cute.....

 On July 26, 2000, two friends, Jim and John, each received a $1000 bonus
 at work.
 (They both work for Nortel Networks, where in the summer of 2000, there
 was LOTS of money around for bonuses). Jim, being an intelligent,
 financially conscientious person, put the whole $1000 into Nortel
Networks stock. With his $1000, and the transaction cost of
 $35, he was able to purchase 7 shares at $123 each. Having watched the
 Nortel stock climb and climb, he felt very good about this investment,
 happy that he is preparing for the future.

 John, being a more care-free sort, did something slightly different with
 his $1000. John borrowed a friend's truck, and proceeded to the
  Beer Store, where he purchased 33 cases of beer. John also felt very
good about his investment: 33 cases x 24 = is 792 bottles of beer! John,
also
 being an intelligent guy, although perhaps not as forward-thinking as
Jim, calculated that he could drink about 15 bottles per week, and he
wouldn't
 have to buy beer for a whole year.

 Jim, of course, was appalled by John's purchase, and berated him
 constantly about it. As months went by, Jim excitedly watched the
 stock prices, and saw it start to dwindle. ""It'll go back up"", he'd say
to Jim.  Jim, who has been reaping the benefits of his investment
on a daily basis, would reply, ""Ya, it will.  Hang in there buddy ""burp"".

 Months went by, and the value of the stock continued to fall, and there
 was the beginnings of a noticeable dent in the beer pile. Midwinter came,
 Jim's stock had fallen to about half of it's original value, and John's
 beer was about half gone. Jim, being sure that the
 stock had hit rock-bottom, still was berating John for his frivolous
 purchase, telling him ""Your beer will be gone in six months! Who knows
 what my stock will be worth!!"".

 Well, summer has come, and hard times at Nortel continue. Bad news: Both
 John and Jim have been affected by the layoffs.  Last week, in order to
 raise some cash to help through the rough time, Jim sold his 7 shares, at
 that day's value of $12, and got $84, then after paying the $35
 transaction fee, he only had $49.

 Jim stopped by John's house later that day (everyone needs their friend's
 during rough times), and as luck would have it, there were
 two bottles of John's beer left. John, being a good, compassionate
friend, offered to share his last two bottles of beer with his friend.
 Jim appreciated the gesture, and enjoyed the cold beer on the hot
summer's day, but he felt a bit guilty.

 ""At least I got fifty bucks back out of it - you have nothing now."", he
 said. ""That's ok."", replied John.  ""Perhaps you can help me, I need to
 return all these empties."", he added as his other friend with the truck
 pulled in. So, they loaded up the truck, and proceeded off to the beer
 store.

 Upon arrival at the beer store, they unloaded the empties, feeling a
 little grim. John went to the counter, and collected his refund for the
 bottles. ""33 cases x 24 bottles, at 10 cents per bottle, that comes to
 $79.20"", the friendly Beer Store clerk said to John as he handed him the
 money. Jim was speechless. Poor guy. Can you imagine  how you would feel
 if you just discovered that over the course of the
 last year, your $1000 stock investment left you with $50, and taking same
 $1000, buying beer, and drinking it, would leave you with $80. I'll leave
 it up to the reader to come up with they're own ""moral to the story"".

Subject:	Nice to meet you by email...!


Hi  John,
 
Nice to meet you by email and thank-you very much  for making yourself available as a source of further info and assistance!   I'm sure you have gotten a ""download"" that sets the context for us to  have a conversation (or two...) over the next little while.  I am  actually flying to Calgary tonight, so I was going to try calling you tomorrow  morning - however, as a trader, would you prefer NOT to receive any calls during  business hours?  If so, when is a good time to be on the phone for  ~25min?  Please let me know.
 
Per your (relayed) request, I have also attached a  current resume.  In addition, I have pasted in some bullet points from a  recent cover letter that outline what I am interested in pursuing and what I  bring to the table.  I'm primarily interested in tapping you for some  energy industry knowledge and a sense of your experiences.  We'll see what  else can happen from there.
 
Thanks again for making yourself available and  hopefully we can hookup soon.  Have a great day!
 
Andy Crysdale.
 
 
 
What I bring to  the table:

Capabilities: I have developed a broad set of analytic,  communication and project management skills and experience. I have leveraged  these skills extensively in realising successes as a technology salesperson  and project manager, an MBA student and management  consultant.  
Capacity to Learn: Three years ago, I had never heard of  WACC.  I had written a 90th percentile GMAT and was on my was to  Ivey.  In the time since, I have completed the MBA, achieving top marks  in Finance, Marketing and an overall Dean's Honour List standing, I  have taught business courses in Russia, I have worked at two top consulting  firms, consulting on a range of projects in various industries, I have paddled  the Yukon River and my wife and I have bought a house and enjoyed the  arrival of our first child. I am a proactive learner with few  limits.  
Commitment: My personal mission statement is to  positively impact people by creating and facilitating positive change.   This core value keeps me highly motivated and interested in being a catalyst  for change.

 
What I am interested in  pursuing:
 
Strategic Planning and  Analysis:  Following on what I was doing at Monitor, I'm looking around for  companies that have an active corporate planning/internal consulting  group.  For the prospective employer, I bring a valuable set of skills  and the rigorous, hard-working disposition that is a by-product of the Monitor  pedigree.  For me, an internal planning or consulting group allows me to  keep growing my experience with various businesses or business units in  various industries.  It also allows me to network, learn an industry and,  with the right company, transition into line management in the  future.  
Business Development: I am also attracted to the  idea of growing a business, primarily because I like generating impact.   I would be interested in ""business development"" roles that combine an element  of selling with involvement in the strategic planning process; basically, the  processes of figuring out what to do and where, and then doing it.  
Growing, Changing Industries:  I am primarily  looking in the financial services, pharmaceuticals and energy  industries.

Subject:	Supply Shortfall Procedures

As I have discussed with many of you, we are revising the Power Pool Supply
Shortfall Procedures (POP 801) in accordance with Transmission Operating
Policy OP-107.  POP 801 contains several steps from the time all the energy
in the energy market merit order has been dispatched up, to the time when a
firm load directive will be issued by the System Controller to curtail firm
load. In order to gather the information required to develop the procedure,
would you please answer the following questions.  Any action you choose to
take is on a voluntary and best effort basis, without any obligation on your
behalf.

In an effort to reduce the amount of, or possibility of having to issue, a
firm load directive to curtail load, would you please reply whether you will
comply with any of the following requests from the System Controller prior
to the issuing of a firm load directive to curtail load.  Please reply not
applicable (N/A) to the questions that do not apply to you.  If you will
comply to any of these requests, we will include the request(s) in the steps
identified in POP 801.  Also, if you will comply to any of these requests,
please indicate the appropriate party for the System Controller to contact.
If you choose not to comply with any of these requests please reply that you
will not.  This will let us know not to make a request for something that
will not be provided, which otherwise could cause confusion and waste
valuable time during the management of this type of an event.

1. Would you provide available generation energy that was not offered into
the energy market merit order if requested to do so by the System Controller
prior to a firm load directive to curtail load?

i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps (i've
called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)

maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's up
(but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
everything's okay)

"RE: Currency Trading","Corporately, we are not allowed to trade currency outside of Houston.  In the same way, we can't make markets on other traders' markets.  If EOL has enough products in currency, we may be able to post our numbers on the screen inside of the Houston currency traders' two-ways.  I am unsure if we are even allowed to do this.

Subject:	Currency Trading

Hi John,

I am interested in started a currency trading desk in this office. The ultimate goals of this would include providing tighter two-ways for our traders as well as improving our bottom line.   This would open up opportunity for investing in money markets outside of Canada and the US.   The Swiss Franc rose 5.5% versus the US dollar last week and I think that we are currently missing out on excellent opportunities to increase our income.  I think I could make money at currency trading, and this area shouldn't be overlooked. I understand that a substantial amount of preparation is required before this could happen.  Let me know whether or not you think this may be feasible and we can take it from there.

Thanks,
Ian

"HR Milner Dispatch","The balancing pool committed in the their beginning of year release to dispatch Milner as follows:

70 MW @ $0
50 MW @ $35.49

Milner has been down for maintenance until recently.

Since coming back from maintenace, the 50 MW block @ $35.49 has disappeared.  We analyzed the offer stack and it appears
that Milner has the full 120 MW @ $0

I called Doug Heath to discuss this.  He hasn't called me back. 

The issue I raised last week about Sherness dispatch is OK. I received a justified answer.  However, this Milner issue is harder for th pool to defend.

Can we pursue this.


Thanks

Subject:	Wholesale Offer to Retail


Guys - I understand that you met with Cross et al to discuss wholesale offers to retail. My original position on the matter has not changed. That is, the wholesale desks need to show a wholesale offer to retail. In other words, the offer shown to our retail affiliate, at a minimum, should equal the offer that would be shown in our wholesale business (either through EOL, brokers or the offer given to originators for wholesale customer deals). 

There has been a great deal of discussion with respect to the margins retail is adding to the wholesale offer. From a wholesale perspective, this is irrelevant. The retail business requires large margins due to its nature - small vol, high credit, commission, call centre, invoicing, etc. 

The retail margin only becomes relevant if prices need to be tighter. In those particular cases, both parties need to work together to make sure that our price is ultimately competitive. This may involve one or both parties reducing their imbedded margins and/or offer. 

I am looking to the two of you to help build the retail business. Your leadership and assistance are crititcal to the success of the retail initiative. Without your cooperation, the business is dead. You are both in a position of power to make or break the retail business in Canada. It is very clear that EES Houston is relying heavily on Lavo and his folks to push forward the retail business in the US - it seems to be working. We need to ensure that we are doing the same. I can guarantee you that your efforts will not go unnoticed. 

I understand that sharing the margin was discussed as an option. This option will not work. From an external perspective, it is imperative that Enron demonstrate its retail capabilities as well as retail earnings. If a portion of retail margin remains in wholesale, it does nothing for expanding the stock multiple. I am convinced that the key lever to expanding our stock multiple lies with retail and therefore retail earnings.

If you have any questions or concerns, I would be happy to discuss this further - at the end of the day, it is imperative that we are all on the same page. 

Regards
Rob

Subject: ClickAtHome Canada Internet Subsidy - Final Reimbursement
Sensitivity: Confidential


Here's the way to claim your Internet fees as part of the ClickAtHome Canada program.   Internet fees are reimbursed through payroll with the final processing date being December 15th .  Below are the simple steps to claim your Internet fees  up to December 31, 2001 :

(1)  Enter your Internet payment information on the ""Clickathome.enron.com/canada"" site.  This initially registers you as an Internet user in the ClickAtHome Canada program and then provides the appropriate information to our accounting department for payment.   You can include your Internet fees from the commencement of the program (June 5, 2001) or for pilot program participants from your commencement date to December 31, 2001. 

(2)  Please complete the first step by  December 15th so your claim can be processed and paid on  December 30th through payroll.   

(3)  Kindly retain a copy of all your claimed receipts as back-up in the event you are asked by Calgary Accounting to provide it. 

** Can't remember your SAP number??  Use this handy site:  <http://isc.enron.com> (follow the instructions for 'SAP or eHRonline password reset' and then 'click here if you have forgotten your personnel number').   Use your SIN number where it asks for Social Security Number and your all set.

If you need assistance with your registration or have questions about your Internet subsidy, kindly contact  Tricia Henry.

John

I am interested in joining the gas trading team next summer as I will be graduating from the U of C in April.  I don't know if I should try going through the fall recruiting or try a different route.  I have not talked to neither my superior (Peggy) nor Kathy yet.  

I've been with Enron since October, but I was (will be again this fall) doing support work for Ryan Watt, and sometimes for Mike Cowan during the weekends.  I work with their supply and demand models, calculate their positions, schedule gas on the Nova pipelines, and work with the Suncor and PetroCanada accounts together with the outsourcing team.  Over the summer, I had the opportunity to work with Kathy's group to get some experience on the slightly more complex deal types that Enron offers.

I had an interview with McKay back in early June.  However, I guess back then I was doing summer classes, the interview did not go as well as I hoped.  Now with summer classes over, I was just wondering if I could try again.

Please let me know what you think and I look forward to your reply.

Kind regards,

Victor Leung

Subject:	Good Bye

As most of you already know I am leaving Enron after five years to go to Harvard MBA School.  My times at Enron have been beyond the expectations that I had when I stepped into trading hourly power at odd hours of the night  when  I first became an Enron analyst.  Since the very beginning, Enron has given me the chance to demonstrate my talents and the chance to prove myself.  No other company would have given those chances at such a young age.  I like to think that I repaid the favor to at least some degree and am leaving Enron a little stronger than it would have otherwise been.  

Even though I contemplated several other opportunities to leave over the last five years, I never left for another company.  I came to realize that the people that work here are the best, and I have always strived to be among the best.  Aside from the professional skills and energy, the people here have become good friends of mine.   Enron is among the best corporations in the world because of the high quality of people that we have attracted over the years.

Special thanks to Jim Fallon, Jeff Golden, Mark Muller, Dave Delainey, Kevin Presto, and Rogers Herndon, all of  whom have provided me direction and excellent leadership during my time here.

Please find my forwarding email address, phone numbers, and address.  If any of you need anything or come to Boston please look me up, I will always buy the first beer!  Good luck to you all.

Your friend,

John

Subject: High 2nd order for deal 638008 - July 6 X July 5


The following is a summary of our findings regarding the high 2nd order for option deal 638008 , effective date July 6, previous date July 5:

The total deal daily change: -172899 is correct.
The historical greeks and curve shift are correct. They add up to -62084
The daily liquidation value  [196872] is not correct, and is pushing the 2nd order to a very high (highly negative) amount. Upon examining the option liquidation report, we find that there is $43680 in liquidation and $153192 in expiring options. 
This totals to $196872. The issue is, the expiring options are no longer part of the option's effective date value, and they were part of the previous date's value (since they hadn't expired yet). Therefore, the liquidation values should be:
Liq: $43680
Expired: -$153198

which totals to a negative value of -109512. If we use this value (-109512) in the daily liquidation column (which arguably could be split between liquidation and expiry) instead of the current value (196872), which results in a second order value of -1297.

We are still discussing the causes and implications of this issue. Please let us know if you have any further questions or if you have any issues with this explanation.

Dad asked if I wanted to lend you some money but I am reluctant to do it at
this point in time since:

a) I am not completely at liberty to touch all the cash that I have
received lately for concern that it may be taken bank under potential
creditor action against Enron.  Unfortunatelty, without this cash, I really
can't afford to lend any.  The cash that I received recently represents 80%
of the cash that I have and I am not sure when I can count on this cash
with any degree of certainty.  Therefore, I am reluctant to touch this
money for at least 6 months.

b) As of right now, I don't have a job after Feb. 28.  The new company deal
that Enron is trying to structure with its traders and a new buyer will not
be
done until the month.  If this deal falls through, then I have to find a
job with another company.  In this case, it is most likely that I will have
to move back to the
US since my contacts and the most lucrative opportunities (i.e. compared
the the new Enron deal) are there.

c) If I had the cash to give, Dad asked that I could give you a discount to
the bank mortgage.  With discount rates near 5%, even if I gave you a
mortgage at
4%, I don't think the monthly interest saving for you would be material
enough.

d) I think it is good for you to develop a credit rating with a bank
through a mortgage.  It is very beneficial for later on in life.  Paying
visa bills does help you a bit in this
category, but not like a mortgage.


Hopefully, you can get the financing from a bank.  I think that this is the
best solution in the long run.

   Hi John,

   Wanted to talk to you about the house stuff.  Dad told me that he was
   talking to you about financing options.  I just wanted to say that I
   don't
   want you to feel compelled to write a mortgage for me -- dad's just
   trying
   to explore different options.  I know it's a lot of cash, and I would
   never
   want to impose on you.  I'm sure that I can get a mortgage from the bank
   at
   a decent rate, as long as I can put down the 25% down payment so that I
   can
   avoid the mortgage insurance, which is costly.  I'm cashing in some GICs
   and other bonds, and Ali's going to lend me $10K, so I will be able to
   come
   up with the $55K for the down payment.

   If writing the mortgage is something that you would like to do for a
   stable
   investment, then we can talk too.  My time horizon on the condo is 5-7
   years, so i recognize that that would hold up your capital for a long
   while.  Anyway, I have to go ahead and get the guarantee of financing
   within 5 days or so, so I have to make a decision in the next day either
   way.  Maybe you can call, or email me?

CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. 
Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. 
The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. 
CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) 
In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. 
After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. 
There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. 
Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.

Subject:	Automated Dispatch and Messaging System (ADaMS) Implementation De	lay

Dear Participants:

I'm writing to provide you with an update on our progress to launch the
Automated Dispatch and Messaging System, or 'ADaMS' for short. In my May 25
note I outlined the efficiency benefits of the new system, and attached a
copy of our tentative implementation schedule.

Since then, we've been busy testing the product to make sure it meets the
Power Pool's standards for quality, and the expectations of our
participants. And to be frank, at this point in time it doesn't quite
measure up. We feel we'd be jeopardizing the quality of the product to meet
the timeline. And that's not the way we do business. Instead, we've decided
to shift the launch to early September 2001. The change will also provide
additional time for participants to prepare, especially during the summer
holiday season, and allow for more one-on-one training with individual
participants as requested.

Our technical staff will be contacting you in July, to ensure you can
connect to the system and receive test dispatches.  Also, we will contact
you with a firmer implementation schedule as we approach September.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to contact
either myself at (403) 233-6491, or your respective Participant Liaison
listed below.

Company Name:   A-E  Elizabeth Vergara (403) 233-6405

Hi John

How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago essays
later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your home
account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so tonight).

PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained a
lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty frustrated
because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday telling
her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk /
exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's afraid
of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.

"Canadian function currency","We have traditionally have had currency issues in Canada regarding P&L preservation versus cashflow preservation.

We have been valued in P&L under the US$ but due to Revenue Canada reasons our functional currency has been C$ (i.e.  the preponderence of cashflows were in C$ from the legacy gas deals, PetroCanada, Suncour, etc, and the PPA position).  Since trader evaluation at year end has been in US$, traders would hedge C$ positions immediately as the trade occured.  The hedge would extend until the position rolled of his book.  From a P&L systems point of view, this would preserve the trader's P&L in US$.  However, from a treasury point of view currency risk would still exist until cash exchange hands; these cash exchange dates were different for financial trades, physical trades and inter-company trades.  There was also some currency risk (albeit small) between billing dates from SAP and settlement dates of the respective trade type.

It is my opinion that the functional currency should match the evaluation currency in order to mitigate many of the above problems.  To a certain extent, I am indifferent if it is US$ or C$.

The timeline of the decision is being driven by our accounting group who need to set up the SAP system.  They are trying to work within a deadline to have the company capable of performing transactions by Jan 29.  This is the date that they have been told to meet by Houston.  As a result, we would need a determinination of the functional currency by Mon Jan 28.

Hey John:

Will be in your old town next week, plan to get together with Fisher and
Cunningham and to meet Meghan Fisher for the first time.....

You have any thoughts/insight on when the bleeding stops on your stock, and
others like ILA, RRI, DYN, EPG?  Looks to me like investors are no longer
wowed by big earnings from the western markets and are very concerned about
sustainability of some very high earnings growth rate projections.  Also
curious as to how this has impacted morale vis a vis stock options and if
management is commenting.....

Hope all is well with you!

Hey Jim and Greg, Jessica and I sent a card to Chris's wife asking about his well-being and this is the unfornate response.


 Sent: Friday, October 05, 2001 3:04 PM
Subject: From Anne Wodenshek
Jessica and John,  
Thanks for the card, yes Chris was in the WTC, 105th floor on Tuesday  the 11th...2 days after our 12th wedding anniversary.  I hadn't spoken to  him at all that day and he wasn't able to call after the attack.  I only  hope that he wasn't frightened and that he didn't suffer. 
Some of the  other people who worked for Chris were able to contact their loved ones and they  said that they were going to be evacuated.  None of the 36 people who  worked for Chris got out, and in total, there were nearly 700 employees of  Cantor, Espeed and TradeSpark that didn't survive. 
We are all in a state  of shock and disbelief.  Chris would have turned 36 on 9-22.  He was  the most wonderful, hardworking, dedicated, easy going, kind, loving and  respectful person I have ever known.  He never had a bad word to say about  anyone nor was there a bad bone in his body.  The children and I, (5), feel  like our lives ended that same day.  I can't imagine moving on or ever  being happy again.  There is no reason for this dispicable act...this world  will never be the same. 
There were many articles about Chris in various  papers here in NJ and NY.  I was also on CNN when we were searching for  him.  You can find these at the Starledger.com, NYtimes.com, the Stamford  Advocate, Bergen record and info on the Cantorusa.com website.  I have set  up a trust fund for the children if you are interested.  The address is The  Christopher Wodenshek Children's Trust c/o Attorney Thomas Palace 20 Court  Street Hackensack, NJ. 
I am not sure if John worked at TFS with Chris,  but that sounds familiar to me.  If so, I wanted to let him know the Ted  Mahoney ( or Maloney?) was also at Cantor and is also amoung the missing.    
Thanks again for your kind card and prayers.  Please continue to  pray for peace in our and our children's time! 
Fondly, 
Anne, Sarah,  Haley, Mollie, WIll and Zachy Wodenshek

Subject:	Ancillary Services Exchange Customer Document-Version 1

Colleagues
Arising from comments received from Friday to yesterday, Watt-Ex has
incorporated a number of changes into this executable Version 1 of the
referenced document.

We are attaching a blackline copy and clean copy of this document for your
perusal.  We believe we have been able to accommodate most of the change
requests -- but not all.  We would be pleased to respond to any comments you
may have on the changes as well as those we have not included.

The key modifications from Draft 3 to this Version 1 relate to the
following:
	1) 3011. and 3209.  Failure to Supply:  Liquidated damages have been capped
both for non-System Events and System Events.  The original context of costs
attributable to liquidated damages included WSCC penalties -- the caps serve
to limit the total amount of liquidated damages claimed against the failed
supplier.  In addition, the penalties under (b) (i) in both sections have
been removed.
	2) 204.  Code of Conduct:  This section has been beefed up to provide a
directive concerning any potential market manipulation that could cause WSCC
penalties to be applied.
	3) 116.  Mediation and Arbitration Procedure: The Mediation procedure has
been modified to allow the parties the option of proceeding directly to
arbitration if they so wish and have applied a finite completion time on the
process.
	4) Schedule 6, 6000.  General:  Applied direction of applicability of
sections to Transmission Administrator
	5) 6004.08  Additional Security:  Due to exposure on liquidated damages,
Watt-Ex is requiring that Sellers post security for same within 90 days
(this is roughly timed for October trading) unless there is sufficient
Receivables to cover.

We would again request your indulgence to review and execute this Version 1
as soon as possible.  In this regard, we request that customers complete
pages 1-3 of the document plus individual Schedule 2's for each Ancillary
Service Facility and fax a signed copy of pages 1-3 plus the Schedule 2's to
Watt-Ex to immediately activate your trading privileges.  Please mail the
originals to Watt-Ex, we will execute and return your file copy.

If there are any outstanding items you wish to have considered/reconsidered,
Watt-Ex will accept such written comments for consideration in a future
version of this Customer Document.

Watt-Ex is also prepared to provide any of the following documents if it
will assist you in attaining comfort with all the attendant infrastructure
surrounding the operations of the Exchange.  Please advise if you wish a
copy of any/all of these documents.

	1) Alberta Securities Commission Exemption Order
	2) The NCM insurance binder document for the credit backstop arrangements
	3) Deposit Agreement with Watt-Ex's Trustee, Royal Trust Corporation of
Canada
	4) Confirmation of ESBI Alberta Ltd.'s Credit Approval to $20 million.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact the undersigned by
return e-mail or call 403-210-8222, 403-210-2144 or 780-940-2820 (cell).

Further to our meeting today, please find attached the list of contracts ECC is taking the view are properly terminated and the dates of such termination (in ECC's opinion).  This list was last updated on January 9, 2002 before I went away, so Bryan, if there are any other counterparties that should be added to the list, can you please let Kyle, Eric, John and myself know as soon as possible?

Database users have gone nuts last few months and even myself, who has access, is being told that I can't run queries I used too.  I'm thinking about putting perf report requirements into a ""gooey"" so IT can program.

I'll continue prodding Bharat to give you the query, and I'll see what I can do regarding the database?

I was wanting to get access to the following database for myself and Chelsea Bardal:

O:/erms/controls/rmsdata/~0RMSDBS97a.ldb

We need this access so that we can query and load the VAR information for the Calgary gas desk by trader.  This information will be used to generate a weekly set of performance measures for Rob Milnthorp, the president of ECC, and John Zufferli, the head of ECC trading.

Please let me know if there will be any problems with this.

Dear Mark  :

Here is the Customer Satisfaction Survey promised in my October 31, 2001 letter. Your input will help improve Customer Service at ESBI Alberta Ltd.  Our consultant, Praxis Research, has worked with us to develop an easy-to-use online survey that should only take about 5-10 minutes to complete.

You may complete the survey online or fax a completed printed version of the web survey to 1-403-249-8983.  If you would prefer to complete the survey via telephone, please call Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285.

To access the online survey, please click on the following Internet link: www.praxis.ca/eal/eal_survey1.htm.

We have assigned you an individual password: mad98  which you need to access the survey.   If you do not complete the survey at one sitting you can use your password to re-enter the survey and finish your partially completed survey or revise your responses. (Up to Nov. 30 at which time the response period terminates and we analyze the input).

Your responses are confidential. Praxis, the independent research firm collecting the information, will aggregate all data. Comments will always be aggregated by Praxis to maintain individual confidentiality. If, however, you choose to identify yourself, EAL will be glad to respond to any specific comments you make. If you have any questions or concerns about the online survey please contact David de Lange at Praxis Research at 1-888-882-1285 or by email at delange@praxis.ca.

All participants will receive an executive summary of the survey.  In addition, early in 2002 we intend to host a workshop to, among other things, develop customer service improvement initiatives in response to the survey findings.

Your participation in this survey is greatly appreciated.


Sincerely,


Vincent Flynn
President and CEO
ESBI Alberta Ltd.

Gentlemen,

First, my condolences on your stock price.  All I can say is that I
empathize: AES fell 49% in one day a few weeks ago.  I suspect the market
will bounce back for both our companies before very long.

I attach a speadsheet with slightly revised performance numbers, and per
our last conversation, I have added numbers on ramp rates and start times
to help you better model the optionality.  When the forwards improve (as a
developer, I MUST be optimistic!), you can use this updated information to
update your pricing.  I look forward to resuming our discussions.

Derek/John,
 
Quick question... from what I have read, it  appears as though the way the Power Pool works, the Pool settles with the buyers  and sellers each month.  However,what happens when we contract with a  counterparty directly?  Does the pool collect payment due for energy  delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the  supplying party?  Or does the financial settlement occur directly between  Enron and the counterparty?  Please advise,
 
Thanks,
 
Wendy

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Good afternoon, all.  

We are exploring ways to assist you with your financial planning needs and have asked a financial planner to meet with you 'en masse' to discuss financial structures that are out of the norm - innovative solutions to tax, retirement and other financial planning issues.  His name is Murray Greenberg and he's associated with the firm, Financial Dynamics.  Murray has extensive experience dealing with senior managers at companies that include Northstar Energy, Deloitte & Touche and Toronto Dominion. 

If, as a result of this meeting, you are interested in what Murray has to offer - you may approach him individually and arrange for personal financial planning.  You are responsible for any fees associated with future arrangements.

Please let me know if you are interested in attending this meeting or if you would like further information.  Nella and I will pull together some potential meeting dates within the next 2 weeks.

"RE: Settling with the Pool","I tried to answer you but my response was returned undelivered.  Basically, the pool is agnostic, it pays power producers for the pyhsical energy delivered to the grid and it charges power consumers for energy taken from the grid.  Any financial arrangements between the buyers and sellers are not known to the pool.  The only mechanism the pool uses for physical power transactions is the direct sale mechanism.  The terms and volume of these direct sales are entered in the pool's trading system.  The pool then subracts the volume of the direct sale from the consumers and producers meter and pays/charges the producer/consumer on the net volume (i.e actual production-direct sales or actual consumption-direct sales)

Derek/John,
 
Quick question... from what I have read, it  appears as though the way the Power Pool works, the Pool settles with the buyers  and sellers each month.  However,what happens when we contract with a  counterparty directly?  Does the pool collect payment due for energy  delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the  supplying party?  Or does the financial settlement occur directly between  Enron and the counterparty?  Please advise,
 
Thanks,
 
Wendy

Subject:	RE: Ontario Update

Rob,

Markets
My marks show how we believe the market would trade if the market were open today, considering neighboring markets, transmission/wheeling costs, and fuel costs.  More of a expected liquidation value vs. the current Ontario market players bids and offers.

The market on 3yr 7x24 is being shown by a broker: $46-$48, and on the wholesale side I doubt the bid is actually there, or if so it is only a piece deep (50MW).  

As a result, I would show an actually two way of $43-$47.50 and be coming from the sell side to the industrial customers who may pay in the $46-$47 range.

Peak, my 3yr mark is $52, but given the often bullish nature of new markets, I would be a bid for this summer and then look to offer the 3yr in the low fifties.  Upcoming changes in the Ontario system (Nodal vs. Zonal pricing) would have an effect on these term deals.


Staffing and Services

Trading
On the trading side, I will need to rehire personnel for the roles we laid off (an analyst and a temp IT programmer for fundies development).  Analyst wise, I am interested in bringing Brian Loy back if he is still available.  He has a good knowledge of the NUG contracts and is a good fit for a trading desk.  As our need for providing IMO Energy and Operating Reserve Services (bidding for specific NUGS and Dispatchable Loads) grows, it may be a good idea to bring Heather Mcillmurray over from the settlements group.  I have had initial discussions with Richard Crouch, Paul Devries and Heather on this matter.

Origination
This is your area of expertise. I would suggest two originators and an analyst.  If Dan Dorland is staying, he could continue on the origination side providing education to our new origination team, and being the analyst to assist the OEFC-NUG point personnel (Brian Loy's previous role).  

IT
Implementing the trading and VMS systems is a very important issue where timing will become an issue. I would suggest a short term (6mo) contract with Mike Marryott to manage the system's side of this process and to integrate with the Estate and NETCO on trading and settlements systems (specifically David Posten's VMS team).  His location should be in Toronto.  

Let's get on these issues as soon as possible.

On specific personnel, I would have liked to have retained Jeff Borg and Chris Gaffney. 

Office Space
Tembec, our neighbor on this floor, has often indicated that they are interested in some of our office space. If that interest remains, we could examine leasing all of the space passed the flat screens (the origination desk/pod, one conference room and storage area, not to include our server room).  This would leave us with space for up to 24 people, two conference rooms, & kitchen.  As an alternative, we could consider moving upstairs into the Enron Direct location.

Potential Conflict of Interest
I would suggest releasing employees that will not be part of Estate or UBS relatively soon.  Specifically, the group that is leaving here, but will be participating in the Ontario market.  UBS Ontario information and resources are proprietary and confidential.  If personnel are being kept on to wind-down specific activities, their access to UBS power & gas curves should be restricted.

As time becomes available, we should get together and discuss Ontario's business plan. 

Thank you
Garrett

CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun. 
Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. 
The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. 
CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) 
In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. 
After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. 
There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. 
Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.

Gentlemen,

Besides the upcoming workshop we are organizing in Calgary, I would like
to bring to your attention some of the software technologies we are
developing for Energy Risk management in Calgary.

Our technology is Modular (multithreaded C++ DLLs) and can be integrated
into yours with great ease.
More generally, the cost of software development is quite lower in
Canada, I would also like to explore the possibility of outsourcing some
of your development: we have a strong analytics team: 3 PhD in Numerical
and applied math (all of us are well established Profs at the
University), and a software team ...

I have included a document describing our products.

Thanks for your request for information on the Calgary Stampede's Infield
Suites.  The Stampede's inventory of Infield Suites for the entire 10 days
of Stampede are held by our major corporate sponsors who have licensed the
suites as part of long-term contracts.

Each year, however, a very limited inventory of suites are offered back to
us from some of our 10-day suiteholders in ""whole-day packages"" -- what that
means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
performance to be sold as a package.

This ""return"" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
lease suites for a single day or days.

To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
assist.

Are things a little less crazy today?  Did you and Jess work things out
last night?  Why was she so upset (besides the obvious reason on the work
front).

I just went to the cardiologist for my follow up heart tests.  They said
everything looks okay, and i just need to go back once a year for stress
tests.

I'm going to look at condos on Monday.  Starting in the Yonge and
Davisville area, then going to look at St. Lawrence Market (lofts mostly),
King & Bathurst and Bay / Bloor.  Still not sure if I should buy....

Subject:	Automated Dispatch Messaging from the Power Pool of Alberta

The implementation of the Automated Dispatch Messaging System (ADMS) from
the Power Pool of Alberta is proceeding on schedule, however, the processes
for implementation and training are changing slightly as described below.
The purpose of this memo is to inform all of the participants who have been
contacted for the implementation of ADMS of the processes over the next few
weeks and the requirements for the implementation at your dispatch
locations.

Beginning the week of July 2, 2001 and continuing through July 13, 2001,
Power Pool staff will be contacting you individually to provide you with
your username and password and ensure that you are able to log into the web
site.  This initial web site will be on a development system that is not
connected to the active market system.  This will enable participants to log
onto the system to become familiar with the screens and user features as
well as receive test dispatches.

Beginning the week of July 16, 2001, the Power Pool will turn off the
development system web server and transfer to the active market system.  The
System Controller area will contact each participant and ""walk you through""
the screens and answer any questions that you may have regarding use of the
system.  Once you are familiar with the system through this conversation,
future active dispatches will then be provided over the ADMS system.  The
sequential addition of participants to the system will enable the orderly
transfer from the voice dispatch process to the automated process with a
minimum of disruption in the dispatch process.

The above process changes the manner in which training will be provided.  In
reviewing the user screens, we believe that participants will be able to
understand how to use the system simply by having access to the system prior
to the implementation.  If there is any difficulties encountered using the
system, the System Controllers will be available to assist you with any
questions as your users begin to use the dispatch system.

The majority of you have indicated that your computer equipment is in place
and that you are ready to start implementation.  If you are unable to start
the implementation process on July 2, 2001, please let the Power Pool
contact know and he will arrange to schedule your user names, passwords and
access closer to July 16, 2001.

The implementation of digital certificates to enhance the security of the
system will be delayed for a short period of time to enable a newer and
simpler digital certificate system.  We believe that by implementing without
the digital certificates, fewer implementation problems will be encountered
and will also simplify the digital certificate installation process with
users at a later date.  Our implementation of username and password
protection combined with server certification provides adequate security in
the short term before the digital certificates are incorporated.

As we discussed, the system provides audible alerts for the users when a
dispatch is received.  I am attaching six files that contains audible alert
sounds for you to load on your computers.  To install these .wav files on
your computers, create a folder
			C:\\PPOA\admin_sounds
and copy these files to the new folder.  Your internet browser will then use
these files for the audible alerts that are provided by the system.  You can
review this with the person who will be contacting you with usernames and
passwords if there is difficulty implementing these alert sounds.

As the implementation portion of the ADMS project moves to the operational
area of the Power Pool, contact points with the Power Pool will change.
Effective immediately, would you please use the following contact names for
work on the ADMS implementation.

		Primary contact:
				Jack Kelly
				(403) 233-6410
				jack.kelly@powerpool.ab.ca

		Secondary contact:
				Jerry Mossing
				(403) 233-6409
				jerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca
<mailto:jerry.mossing@powerpool.ab.ca>

Thank you very much for your cooperation in getting this system underway.

Subject:	New Start

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Just to keep you informed, we are progressing towards launching the AIS Demad Swap. As discussed I have a target date of Sep 30, 01 to launch this product.

Per your suggestions, we have changed the product from a peak to flat (7x24).

John, we are planning to meet and educate counterparties in Alberta to market this product. Do you think brokers are going to play a role in this? Please let me know. If yes then we will educate them on this product as well.

If you think of some thing that we need to take care of at this time, please let me know.

I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,

the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account

Are you still interested in beers today?  I have unfortunately come down

Peggy & John
The estate's DPR reporting requirement to risk controls in Houston is going to be twice a week.  Consistent with this I would also like to change our internal DPR reporting process for ECC Power-Estate from DAILY to twice per week.  Note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily.
 
I would like to make this change starting Feb 1.  Please let me know if you are okay with this.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.  With the exception of Gas, Susan Trevino will be sending the benchmarks to each of the groups for their review.  
 
If anyone anticipates any problems with this time frame, please call me or Shona to discuss.

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

"RE:","I talked to Milly yesterday, he was ok with the concept of covering the 1 month salary.  I talked to Trish and the easiest/non-tax affected way to handle it is to submit expense forms.  The problem is if you sell the car at a loss, then the loss compensation is tax deductible, if you import the car, then the transport costs/imports duties can be submitted as an expense and is not exposed to taxes. I talked to Trish about exactly what you have proposed and she wasn't sure from an equity standpoint between what was given to other employees that she could do that. However, don't worry about it I'll do my best so that you are kept whole in one way or another.  The easiest position for me to push is if you actually want to keep your car, then you can expense the duty.

John,

Did you have a chance to talk to Dawn / Milly? Even if you want to work the flight / hotel / movers the usual way and then pay the balance as a ""signing bonus"" or something that would probably work. I am going to take a bath on my car in a big way. The option of moving my it back to Canada is out of the question as I just found out I would have to pay 6.1% import duty, 7% GST and about $400 in excise taxes and permits. Let me know.

results from the Powertech study to be held at EAL's offices from 2:00 pm to
4:00 pm on Tuesday October 9, 2001..  EAL commissioned Powertech Labs of
Vancouver earlier this year to carry out studies to derive Total Transfer
Capabilities (TTC) for both imports and exports across the AB-BC
interconnection.  These studies have now been completed and work is underway
to revise existing operating policies (ie.  Specifically OP-333 and OP-328).
The studies confirm that there is an increase in export capability from
additional generation in the Calgary area.

This presentation will focus on the technical results of the Powertech
studies and the impact on TTC for the AB-BC interconnection.  To make the
most of this meeting, please give some consideration to questions of
clarification around TTC you may require.  Please confirm your attendance at
this meeting with Debbie Nering at (403)-705-5210 or e-mail at

track there (at least it's something to do in the winter).  when she was
down this weekend, we walked around the craft show (at the Exhibition
place) and she said that was a lot of exercise (2 hrs).  The only problem
is that we were just strolling, and not really walking very fast.

   Hi John

   How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?

   I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago
   essays
   later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
   that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your
   home
   account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so
   tonight).

   PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained
   a
   lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty
   frustrated
   because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday
   telling
   her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk
   /
   exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's
   afraid
   of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
   she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.

Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for non-firm energy trades.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possibilities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market each morning and throughout the day.  

Enron Canada will be trying to obtain non-firm transmission nearly every hour.  WE need to tell them if this is an unwise practice from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, as they will lose around $7 per mw (CDD) on unused transmission with zero chance for return.  

Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  They will give us the first look, but if we cannot use their energy, they will contact WWP, IPC, TransAlta or other counterparty in an attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and I think it leaves us open to tainted customer relationships, financial loss, and embarrassment.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before the fact (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with NW counterparties that you are buying or selling a non-firm product.  Determine a book-out price to solve problems with physical flow if necessary.  We are basically buying a put or a call and should pay our counterparty appropriately.

Finally, I would like to see improved communication with Enron Canada.  It appears we have limited our contacts within our own company and hindered the flow of information to both parties' detriment.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both parties for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that can only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding our relationship with Enron Canada, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

 Enron Canada bids a fond farewell to Jon McKay who is heading back to the trading group in Houston later this summer.  This will be Jon's second tour of duty south of the border.  During his time with us, Jon has contributed significantly to Enron Canada and will be missed.  Congratulations and best of luck, Jon!

Effective today, John Zufferli will be assuming responsibility for Gas Trading in Canada in addition to his responsibility for Power Trading.  John started his career with Enron in the U.S. but came home to his native land at the end of 2000.  Congrats on your new role, John!

Tickets for the 2002 Stampede Rodeo go on sale Monday, August 20 through Ticket Master.  I am enquiring how may tickets we would like.  Eric talked about possibly sitting in the Infield seats for our customer event or renting a suite.  Suites will not be determined until the beginning of 2002 once the major corporate sponsors have decided on if they wish to lease the suite for the day.  If you could please try to get back to me by Wednesday with ticket numbers.  I will order tickets on Monday when Ticket Master opens.  

Infield apx $55
Regular Rodeo Seating apx $32

Suite cost about - 
Super Suite - 2001 prices
Rodeo Only includes 50 suite tickets for Afternoon Rodeo only
July 6-13	$13,520	
July 14-15	$14,870	
Chuckwagons Only includes 50 suite tickets for Chuckwagon Races only
July 6-13	$6,760	
July 14-15	$7,435	


Thanks for your request for information on the Calgary Stampede's Infield
Suites.  The Stampede's inventory of Infield Suites for the entire 10 days
of Stampede are held by our major corporate sponsors who have licensed the
suites as part of long-term contracts.

Each year, however, a very limited inventory of suites are offered back to
us from some of our 10-day suiteholders in ""whole-day packages"" -- what that
means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
performance to be sold as a package.

This ""return"" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
lease suites for a single day or days.

To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
assist.

John,
I don't disagree with any of the comments you made in my performance review, but would still like to meet with you. I'd like to discuss some stuff relating to career development, how I can improve, some learning objectives, etc. Can we set aside a half hour sometime this week or early next week? Please e-mail me the times that would work best for you.

Subject:	UBS Trade Products

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Subject:	Stampede Rodeo for 2002 - Important, Tickets go on sale Monday

July 7th - 16th are the dates for 2002 Stampede

Tickets for the 2002 Stampede Rodeo go on sale Monday, August 20 through Ticket Master.  I am enquiring how may tickets we would like.  Eric talked about possibly sitting in the Infield seats for our customer event or renting a suite.  Suites will not be determined until the beginning of 2002 once the major corporate sponsors have decided on if they wish to lease the suite for the day.  If you could please try to get back to me by Wednesday with ticket numbers.  I will order tickets on Monday when Ticket Master opens.  

Infield apx $55
Regular Rodeo Seating apx $32

Suite cost about - 
Super Suite - 2001 prices
Rodeo Only includes 50 suite tickets for Afternoon Rodeo only
July 6-13	$13,520	
July 14-15	$14,870	
Chuckwagons Only includes 50 suite tickets for Chuckwagon Races only
July 6-13	$6,760	
July 14-15	$7,435	


Thanks for your request for information on the Calgary Stampede's Infield
Suites.  The Stampede's inventory of Infield Suites for the entire 10 days
of Stampede are held by our major corporate sponsors who have licensed the
suites as part of long-term contracts.

Each year, however, a very limited inventory of suites are offered back to
us from some of our 10-day suiteholders in ""whole-day packages"" -- what that
means is we receive back both the rodeo performance and chuckwagon race
performance to be sold as a package.

This ""return"" of suite dates does not traditionally occur until the new
year, when the companies begin to firm up their plans for the upcoming
Stampede.  Until then we maintain a waiting list of companies wishing to
lease suites for a single day or days.

To be added to the wait list, I require a request in writing with all
company details and preferred dates for Infield Suite use.

Please let me know if you have any other questions, I would be happy to
assist.

My thought is that we should be handling this position out of the Calgary office, I am working on booking of this transaction in a system where we can value it, as it stands right now we have it in an excel spreadsheet.

As requested, attached is a file that contains June YTD Originations by Originator.

We've arranged the file in the following sorts:

by team
by Originator (sorted alphabetically)
by Originator (sorted by value)
Top 10 Overall Originators by Value
Top 10 Originators- Gas
Top 10 Originators- Power

An item to note is that not all deals had a related individual's name (such as Enduser)- we left the listing as it appears in the Risk Book in these cases.

We'll send you an update if the DPR amounts move (the DPR isn't final yet.)

Please let me know if you need any additional information!

Zuff

Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.

Chris.

Subject:	RE: How are things

Things are going well here. We have been working on cleaning up Dec. I cautiously optimistic about UBS. I think the fact that they put no money up front could make things difficult with the creditors. I am not sure if they will accept the fact that will only get money from profits that we make. There are no guarantees that we will be profitable.

Yeah, the last few weeks are hard. I am sure she is at the point she just wants it over with. Are you ready for your life to get flipped around. It's a lot of fun but difficult for the first 2 months. After that it get's easier as you go.

So I assume you are riding it out with UBS? Not sure how I feel about the situation. Could be just the fear of the unknown.

How is Cooper doing?

"RE: Load Following","1) For a full requirements deal, I would like some sense of the load shape of the customer.  Having just monthly total energy consumption is not enough to price a deal.
2) The all requirements price may be less or greater than the peak price, it is dependent on load shape.
3) That is correct.

John
I would like to clarrify how the load following deals for electricity look.  I understand that you are willing to price full load following deals for ED customers for both cummulative and interval meter sites.

1.  What information do you require us to provide you to price a full requirements deal?  We generally see 12 months of average monthly consumption for cummulative meter sites.  Do you need to know which utility the customer is with?  i.e. for NSLS purposes.
2.  How would an all requirements price compare to a peak hour price?
3.  If you were to provide us with a full requirements deal I am assuming that ED would charge/pay  ECC for the delta between the fixed price and the pool price.

The ED standard contract currently does not contemplate a true all requirements deal.  The standard deal structure being used for cummulative meter sites is for a fixed price / volume block of power and for interval meter sites it is a defined volume by hour of the day  for weekdays and weekends by calendar month.

We would appreciate clarrification from you.

 Many thanks

Kate

Hi John,

Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he has
a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to speak
to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from Calgary
and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants general
info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give him
your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?

Subject:	EOL - Multiple Trading Books (URGENT)

Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

John

John, one thing to consider with your nat gas org is the reporting of disturnal to john arnold. From my standpoint, this was an unfortunate move and is similar to us losing the east gas desk to Houston. You will want to give this careful consideration, particularly if you are looking to disturnal to trade alberta power options. With the change in leadership we should discuss whether we want to grab disturnal back (solid line reporting) and suggest dotted line to arnold.

fyi - his P&L for accounting purposes continues to roll-up to canada. However, for internal mgmt reporting, his p&l rolls up to arnold.

Hi John;

I have a commitment (signed application) from the client to contract for power from Enron Direct. I now need to fix the price with you. I had given the attached spreadsheet to Jason last week and the load following ratio was calculated at 1.12 to the flat block pricing. 

The power flow date is July 20, 2001 and ends at 0:00 A.M. on August 1, 2002.

The data on the spreadsheet is the notional quantity of power in kW, for each day, by hour ending, by month. 

Total annual consumption is 3,778,235 kW.

Normally I would get Jason or Shawn to give me the price but I understand they are out of the office for the afternoon.

Please advise me if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Mark Dickin.

John,

We are working on an EnronOnline Website Audit.  We have noticed that many traders have duplicate ID's and are not using some of them.  In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.  Please review the following information and let us know if these are valid books and ID's.

Canada-Power-Basis book
User ID:  ADM53947

Canada-Power-GD book
User ID:  ADM26160

ECC Canada Power book

"RE: Directions","
Take the TransCanada Hwy 1 west to Calgary.  This becomes 16 Ave N in the city.

Take Highway 2 south (Deerfoot) when you get in the city.

When you come to the Deerfoot/Glenmore intersection take Glenmore Trail East.

On Glenmore, you'll pass under Macleod Trail (there is a big mall Chinook centre on your right), you'll pass over the Glenmore reservoir.

When you get to Glenmore and 37 st get in the inside lane of Glenmore.  After 45 st, Glenmore will split in 2, stay in the inside (i.e. leftmost lanes).

This fork will lead you to a stop light where you turn left onto Highway 8 Bragg Creek.

On highway 8 you will pass 69st, after the light get in the outside lane and take your next right on Lower Springbank Rd.  At the the stop sign turn left onto Lower Springbank, you should now be going parallel to Highway 8.  After 85 st and before 101st there is a gravel entrance road on your right, take this road, it is 100 feet long and leads to Slopeview Dr, turn left when the gravel road joins the pavement and go to 133 Slopeview Dr.

"RE:","I am reading your mail, I have asked for the same thing regarding my base. Especially since I came up here with a base salary converted at 1.48 CDN/USD and with no raise since being here at 1.61 CDN/USD I have received a 9% pay cut relative to my peers in Houston.  Not to mention that my base salary is $50-$100 USD/year lower than what other shops are offering.  However, after three attempts, I have been unsuccessful in championing my own cause.

Zuff

Just a quick note after my first look at the numbers.  The only concern I have is with the base number.  Seeing as there is no money up front, the future payments look a lot more like long term comp. than any real signing or retention bonus.  When I came to Enron two years ago I took a $35,000 decrease in base pay in exchange for options and the opportunity to trade for number 1.  That is no longer the case (no options and UBS is not #1) therefore I would look for my base to better reflect market on a go forward basis.  If you are able to accommodate a reasonable adjustment in base I would be very excited about the opportunity to sign with UBS.

I would like to talk about this on Monday, after I have had a chance to look at the paper in full.

Chris.
