"Estate DPR Reporting for Power","Peggy & John
The estate's DPR reporting requirement to risk controls in Houston is going to be twice a week.  Consistent with this I would also like to change our internal DPR reporting process for ECC Power-Estate from DAILY to twice per week.  Note that curves and an official calc will still be required daily.
 
I would like to make this change starting Feb 1.  Please let me know if you are okay with this.

As a follow up to this email, we will start reporting the DPR's on Wednesday's and Monday's, for Tuesday and Friday valuations.  The first Wednesday will be the 30th of January.  Each day we should expect to report the positions, P&L and PRMA of only those transactions we expect to fulfill.

Subject: DPR reporting for 22nd trading due today - request by Fallon


Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
 
- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
 
Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
 
Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

Here is a copy of our top counterparty list.  The online group will be sending out a packet that includes this list and all the information you're group will need to get started.  Please fill out the areas highlighted in red.  We simply need to assign someone from your office that will be our point of contact, as well as the person responsible for getting in the Password Application.  We are using each of the desks relationships to jump start the effort.  Once that is complete, the responsibility will role back over to the online group.  If at all possible, I'd like to have the appropriate names early this afternoon.  Sorry for the short notice.

Thanks again for your help,

"Management Changes","With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

This storm will bring about a pattern change, though still nothing severe in terms of cold.  A mixed bag of precipitation has developed today over the Central Plains. A healthy combination of shallow cold air in the North and record warmth in the South will help spin up a sizeable storm in the Southern Plains later today that will turn to the NE. There are a variety of winter weather watches out from Kansas, Missouri , Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. More can be expected through the Great Lakes and New England later in the week. There will be snow with this, but also some potential for significant freezing rain as well. The storm track is expected to run from NW Texas to just South of Chicago then Western New York. To the South, this is a rain ! event with some thunderstorms as well. This storm will serve to collapse the strong ridge that has been in place over the Eastern U.S. I certainly expect a drop from the record highs of recent days, but nothing in the earth shattering cold category. In fact, the raw numbers from the MRF have trended warmer the last few runs. Since we dont have a thick snow cover to tap from, I believe the period of cold setting up will not be as harsh as what we saw in late December. As all of this is going on, some of the chill that has invaded the West will be lifting out. I don't see a big run to above normal with a surface high still sitting over the plateau region, but it should not be as cold as the last couple of days.

There is not a big snow cover on the ground, a split flow in the jet stream is expected and the polar vortex in Canada continues a slow retreat. With all of that as a backdrop, the slight positive departures look reasonable to me. We may however crank out a ""Clipper Type"" storm next week in the Great Lakes and New England. These can sometimes be more prodigious snow makers than the big ""Plains type"" counterpart we are currently seeing. This is especially true if the air flows over the Lakes at the right angle, something I won't even try to predict this far out. Other than this system, I don't see much action in the 6-10 day period. Howeve! r, there is some potential for another storm to emerge out of the SW just after this.    Day 6: Sunday, February  3, 2002  Click Here  for Syncrasy's 6-10 summary information.

"Canada Commercial Hardcount (20)","Guys, its getting late in the day and I feel we need to let people know where they stand. Please sit down with each of your direct reports and let them know that they will be receiving an offer of employment from UBS (hopefully by tommorrow).

With respect to Fabian and Gerry, I think its important to stress that although they didnt make the first cut, there is still a high probability of being offered UBS employment following the results of round one.

"Market Data Contracts","Everyone,

We are in the process of creating new contracts with UBS for all Market Data real-time applications, subscriptions and publications.  Attached is a comprehensive list of all contracts that will be renegotiated under the UBS name for use by the Gas and Power trading entities.  

In order to leverage UBS' significant discounts and avoid duplicate efforts, Danielle Marcinkowski with Market Data will be the initial point of contact when inquiring about the addition or status of applications or publications.  I bring this to your attention because we understand that several groups have initiated discussions with the various vendors over the past few days.  

If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at 713-853-9358 or Danielle at 713-853-7926.  If you think something is missing from the list, please bring it to our attention immediately.  Please pass this word around within your group as appropriate.

Regards,

Chris Behney

Trough to develop in the East turning the pattern to a normal to below normal temperature regime.   We are looking at a deep trough in the West and strong ridge in the East on this mornings weather maps. Dozens of record highs were set this weekend from the Plains eastward while it was cold enough in the NW for snow in Seattle. Things are on the move now which should end the warmth for most areas by the end of the week. Relative to recent weeks, it certainly looks a lot colder, but when one considers the time of year and steps back, well most areas just don't get that cold. This looks to me to be the type of situation where it will be colder in the Plains and then modify as it heads East. This has a similar feel to what happened in lat! e December. At the moment, we are devoid of snow cover, so I have a difficult time getting too pumped up over all of this. Speaking of snow, the Western U.S. system may produce some moderate snows over the far North and Lakes as it pushes from the High Plains NE to Canada. This does not appear to be a situation that favors any East Coast winter storm development. Short term numbers will still show warmth in the East, but that is a function of the next couple of days. The Western and Central U.S. temperature departures are already below normal and that trend will shift East later this week.    Tomorrow: Tuesday, January 29, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

The SE ridge is replaced by a trough in the means so we should not see the recent spring regime. The trend over the Western part of the continent ( US and Canada) is for Pacific zonal flow. The real bitter cold that has been in Canada the last several weeks should gradually modify. We will likely see two distinct branches in the jet stream, an arctic branch in the North and subtropical branch in the South. We get our big storms and bitter cold outbreaks when they phase(come together). Most of the extreme forecasts you see come together when this phasing occurs. I can not rule it out in the future, but it looks unlikely to me for now. To me, the bottom line for this period(and beyond)is for a slight cold bias East and a close to normal look elsewhere.!

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

I have not found anyone who was trying to renew these contracts.  I am meeting with IHS on Thursday so I will make sure we add Accumap.  How many user of Accumap will you need?  I will forward the cost to you prior to sending the contracts to UBS.  

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

Here are the contracts we are currently creating with UBS.  Please verify that we have not missed any applications/publications or subscriptions.  

Highlight in Red the systems you will need and mark the priority from 1-5,  1 being critical.

"Headcount Latitude","Louise, given the number of declines, is there any latitude in moving up the Canadian Headcount. I believe we cut very deep on the 1st go round. Specifically, there is  a couple of analysts and one manager on the commercial side and on the non-commercial side we'd like to have at least one if not two admins for answering the phones (Admins are roughly U.S. $15K/annum and ours are extremely good). We still might come in under our initial headcount given the decline probabilities, but I would like to offer additional jobs asap as opposed to waiting for responses.

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Colder air settling South and East over the next several days as storms remain active.  It is a very active weather map with extremes on it. For example, Tucson, AZ saw snow yesterday, Kansas City Ice, Chicago has seen almost a foot of snow the last 24 hours and Washington DC was around 80 degrees yesterday. This storm has been a slow mover, but should start to accelerate to the Northeast today. The next system in the short term is a quick clipper system coming through the Great Lakes and heading out to sea. It may rapidly intensify off the coast late in the period, but probably too far offshore for any real problems. The air behind all of this is cold, but not arctic. Even though the five day numbers remain below normal in the West and ! above in the East due to current extremes, the overall pattern will be relaxing for a few days allowing many areas to gravitate to close to seasonal norms this weekend.

Winter storm enthusiasts may see a couple of major storms the first two weeks of February if the MRF is correct. These will likely track farther to the South and East than recent storms opening up the East coast to some potential snow and ice. The Canadian once again hints at a real cold surface high coming down next weekend. It does not show up in the others, but the overall pattern would be supportive of a colder pattern. I don't see the numbers more than a few degrees below normal. The main story could be the storms rather than the cold if the models verify.

I didn't see accumap added to the new list that was sent by chris behney,

the nova, oasis and power pool of alberta accounts that were added in yellow were inappropriately added as these are 
not data sources that require purchasing, they are simply accounts to set-up much like a membership account

I had taken an ""old"" boyfriend  backpacking; he brought along a fly rod. I think he had just started  fly fishing. I tried it out after watching him for a while and I  liked it. It reminded me of Tai Chi and meditation - flowing water,  fresh air - it felt so natural.    So when we returned from our trip  I told my boyfriend that I wanted to fly fish. He replied,  ""You don't know how."" Instantly the tomboy in me rose to the  challenge. Growing up with three brothers, it was a  conditioned response. I had to prove to this boy that I could  indeed fly fish if I wanted to.  So I said, ""I'll  learn."" And a few weeks later an old timer in Arizona gave me  an old rod, a Reel O'Matic and my first casting lesson. I was  hooked and ready to prove myself to the guys.  With a  good year of fishing under my belt, I found myself at the  Santa Ynez River early one morning; no one around yet, big  pools, bubbling water, a golden eagle cruising up the river,  silence. I was fishing a hole with trout and smallmouth bass  in it. All alone, my mind wandered, and I was soon asking  myself whether or not I truly enjoyed fishing, or whether I  was just trying to be better than the boys. I contemplated  this thought while casting, the line unrolling rhythmically on  each forward and back cast. And I felt so very present, in the  now, in peaceful solitude with my world, breathing deep and  then? Fish on!  And the answer was yes. I love this. I  love the way I feel after a day of fishing, as though I had  spent the whole day meditating. I feel fresh and like a kid  again, all sun-baked and dirty after a day rock hopping up a  creek. I enjoy most the solitude. Even if I fish with a buddy,  I am still just with myself, my rod and the cast, trying to  come up with a recipe for catching that fish. I become so  peaceful fishing. And when I spot that big trout rising across  the stream, the adrenaline rush is crazy. It's amazing to me  that I can get so excited about a fish.  I realized that  what had started out as me trying to be as good as the guys  had become a practice instead. It is not a battle after all,  but simply fishing: sharing tips, swapping stories, being part  of a community.  I love being a beginner. It means I  have years to practice and learn about this thing called fly  fishing. And I hope I never lose that beginners mind, because  it is the fuel that pushes me further along and there is  always something new to learn.  BIO Kourtney  Morgan works as a sample maker for Patagonia where she began  fly fishing. Reflecting on the sport, she says, ""I do so many  things I can't say which is my favorite. I will say this, they  all have one thing in common, I do them with joy and reckless  abandon.""

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

"Departure","John,
This note is to officially announce that I will not sign the contract with UBS. I feel it is time for me to start something new and a great opportunity was presented to me in  Montreal. I want to thank you for everything you and this company did for me. I sincerely wish you all the success you deserve in this new adventure.

After having talked to Dawn, I will be in the office until Thursday Feb-21. It was understood that I will be paid for any unused vacation days.

Once again, thank you for your support and good luck with UBS!

Yours Truly,

Subject:	Curves and Correlations

I have to clean up clustering and curve mappings from Estate to NETCO.  Last correlation update was Nov. 29th and I'm assuming we may have some issues.  The curves we are rolling into NETCO need to be highly accurate for the last 60 days to ensure variance covariance matrix is appropriate.  Please provide me list of curves we are using in NETCO.  Identify which curves should be primary and which curves can be secondary.  Additionally, please identify if there are any regional constraints that need to be ""locked in"" between primary and secondary curves.  I will then re-run correlations so we can properly understand diversification benefit across wholesale as it relates to proposed VAR limit structures.

Thanks,
Frank

Title: A Moving Supply and Demand Picture
URL(s):

http://www.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2958;


***********************************************************************

US WEST HYDRO ON THE RISE, DEMAND LOW

Shifting 2002 electricity demand drivers and improvement of hydroelectric
conditions in the US West continue to change the outlook for 2002 and beyond.
Although 2002 demand will still contract from 2001 levels, CERA's updated
outlook calls for modestly stronger demand than previously forecasted. The weak
January fundamentals that have dragged down Henry Hub and western regional gas
prices should continue through February.

*  The level of voluntary and price-responsive electricity conservation in
California appears to be falling as the supply crisis abates.

*  Gas prices have been kept at bay by the lack of evidence of the expected
decline in US supply and weak national economic trends that point to further
delay in the rebound of industrial and power generation demand.

*  The abundant western snowpacks that will be shown to the world during the
winter Olympics are having an impact on regional energy markets.

Transmission Expansion and Systems in Transition  Conference
Feb. 5-8, 2002,  Miami, Florida
 
OVERVIEW
 

This conference will examine the  business and regulatory challenges to U.S. electric systems in transition in  effectively expanding transmission capacity to meet new demands in the larger  and more competitive regional markets emerging under FERC's RTO  initiatives.  The conference will  review the parameters of these challenges and possible solutions to them.  It will examine technology options and  new business models for transmission expansion.  It will analyze emerging proposals for  effective transmission planning and pricing, including market-based pricing  alternatives to FERC's traditional pricing methods. The conference will also  discuss what it will take in legislative action and regulatory initiative to  achieve an efficient regime for ensuring that the nation has a reliable grid and  regional trading system.

Ancillary  Services Conference
 
April  10-12, 2002, Denver, Colorado
 
OVERVIEW

 
As more and more regions in North  America open wholesale markets to competition, the importance of ancillary  services is increasingly recognized. These services, generally provided by the  same generators that produce the competitive energy product, are vital for both  commerce and reliability. 
 
This conference will cover the key  engineering, economic, market, and policy issues associated with these  functions. The conference will also present updates on the status of the various  markets (including market design and operation problems and their solutions,  successes, prices and costs) in North America. These markets include New  England, New York, PJM, ERCOT, and Alberta. Developing markets, such as Ontario,  will also be covered. The market designs encompass issues such as day-ahead  scheduling, real-time operation, integration with the markets for energy and  congestion, measuring the real-time delivery of these services, the operating  costs to produce these services, and the potential for customer loads to supply  these services.
 
The brochure for the Ancillary Services  Conference, April 10-12, 2002,  Wyndham Hotel - Tech Center, Denver, CO can be obtained by clicking on the link  below:http://www.euci.com/pdf/anc_svcs.pdf

Medium range models now suggest this may NOT be winters final gasp.   I don't believe I hype storms as much as many forecasters, but the current storm now forming in the Plains deserves some attention. Some serious snow and ice accumulations are possible from Oklahoma NE to Wisconsin and eventually to Interior New England. Copious rains will fall in the warm sector. This storm should end the recent record warmth in the East with signs now that it may not return for sometime. One thing that has my attention is this current situation is colder than forecasted in the cold sector of the storm and thats the first time this winter the models have underdone the cold. Until now, its been the other way around. I am not looking for an! ything bitter under a split flow jet stream, but its late January and early February and it can still get cold. Also, the pattern while temporarily taking a break from the storms after this current event looks to reload again in the medium range. The short term temperatures still reflect the heat in front of this winter storm, so most of the East is still above normal while the West is below.

First, we could briefly turn on the ""Lake Effect"" snow machine with a weak Clipper system early next week. This should not be anywhere near the magnitude of the Buffalo Christmas event, but is the first one since then. It drags a moderately cold airmass in behind it. Then, later in the period the Southern jet stream becomes active once again. Most models show another sizeable winter storm mid to late next week and at a farther South latitude than the current one. Now, I dont see this 6-10 day period as particularly cold in a relative sense though certainly it will be chillier than recent periods. Numbers may turn out a bit below normal especially over the Northern half of the USA. Some of the models just past this period suggest a more significant Canadian high woul! d be poised to drop down. The warming of the Canadian prairies does not look as likely as I have thought over the past few days, so this idea may have some merit. If the surface pressures forecast turn out to verify, the ocean indices(NAO and PNA) switch their signals and we get some snowcover the next 10 days from potential storms, then this may all come to pass. It would not be an exaggeration to suggest the coldest air mass of the season could come down the second week of February.

Title: Energy Technology Investing: The Bubble Bursts

***********************************************************************

DISTRIBUTED ENERGY INVESTMENT CHALLENGE--EXPECTATIONS MEET NEW REALITIES

Between 1998 and 2001, investors poured some US$4.36 billion into companies
developing distributed energy (DE) technologies. This investment boom and the
subsequent capital market correction were created by overly optimistic
expectations regarding the size of the opportunity and speed of the market's
development.

*  DE's failure to capture a substantial portion of the California market
during the power crisis in early 2001 and the collapse of the
telecommunications and information technology sectors undermined investors'
confidence. Shifting power market fundamentals and growing uncertainty over the
pace and direction of regulatory change also contributed.

*  Although the short-term market for DE technologies has suffered, in the long
run the revised expectations are part of a healthy trend toward greater
maturity among companies and their backers.

*  Restricted access to capital will slow commercialization of new technologies
and drive consolidation among energy technology companies. Public policy will
become an increasingly important source of funds and other support in the
future.

Do you know who managed the contracts with NOVA, Power Pool of Alberta, OASIS or ESBI so that I can gather contact information and begin the contract management of these applications.

"Winner of the Vintage Enron Golf Shirt!!!!","




It was a tough decision, but Angela and I have picked a winner and two runners-up for coming up with the most creative idea for the ""mystery item.""  The winners and their answers are listed below:

Winner: 

David Hanslip for his answer of: 

""...To the casual observer, they look like the support pillars of any standard monitor stand. In reality, their special hollowed out interiors may be used to conceal sensitive accounting documents outlining off-balance sheet financing transactions from the FBI.""

Second Runner Up: 
Paul Dunsmore for his answer of: 
""They are clearly snow shoes for the Smurfs that live in our office..."" 
Third Runner Up: 
Carlee Gawiuk for her answer of: 
""The purpose of the object is for getting the attention of the commercial staff when they are not paying attention to their admin assistants.  There are 6 of them, 3 for each phone.  Simply pick up the object, close your fist around it, extend your arm behind your head, bring it forward in a fluid motion and release the object in the general direction of the person you are wanting to get the attention of.  If it takes more then one throw, that is completely acceptable.  It takes a little practice, so don't be too hard on your self if you need to borrow a few from the other phone.  It is not too big, so no serious damage will be done, & it's not too small so the person or anyone surrounding them will not lose an eye.  The colour is black to contrast with desk, or floor, so it is easy to find after it has been thrown.""

Thank you to everyone else for your very creative answers! 
Congratulations to David, Paul, and Carlee (you may drop by front reception to pick up your prize)!!! 
Thank you, 
Megan Scott

We have seen a definitive change in the weather pattern from last month. January on the whole featured the strong ridge and unseasonable warmth in the Eastern U.S. while the West had a trough and occasional record breaking cold. If you smooth out the maps, we will see in general a reversal over the next two weeks with a trough in the East and Ridge in the West. I still don't see any highlight making cold with this trough, but a ""cold and stormy"" projection does not seem unreasonable for the East. We have this morning a storm in the South that will bring snow to Oklahoma and NW Texas today with rain farther South. It will track towards the SE U.S. coast through Th! ursday then appears to move out to sea. The Interior SE may see some light to moderate snow with this, but otherwise will be a rainmaker. This should be the most significant weather maker in the short term. The coldest of the air in the short term covers the Eastern U.S. right now. This should start modifying although only in a gradual sense through the rest of the week.    Tomorrow: Wednesday, February  6, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

The Canadian and European schemes still look sharper with the western ridge and eastern trough than their American counterpart. The correct forecast up to now most of the time was to go with the warmer solution. This time I am running with the colder one. The Canadian model has been consistent with a stronger Eastern trough since the middle of last week. It brings a moderate batch of arctic air next week into the Eastern U.S. The potential of some sort of East coast storm also remains in this pattern. I am not by any means forecasting any brutal cold, but I am going against yesterdays NWS 6-10 and 8-4 day outlooks which are above normal in the Eastern U.S. I believe most of the region will grade out slightly below normal instead while th! e West is in a moderating phase.

My apologies if this has been done, but I'm in process of assembling list of products that UBS will be trading.  If this list has been compiled, please direct it to me.  

I'm interested in getting the greatest granularity possible breaking it out by VaR portfolio name, trader, trading book, commodity, instrument, location, tenor, relative liquidity for each instrument expressed in contract/day (i.e. could impact holding period for VAR) and best risk mitigator.  (Regarding best risk mitigator, I'm not looking for liquidating position comments, but rather best hedge given curve location.)  This will help in directing correlation efforts for VAR.  See attached spreadsheet for suggested format.

Thanks,
Frank

Eastern ridge gone while arctic air tries to reload to the Northwest.   This may be the first time this winter a forecast understates the cold rather than overstates it. Part of it stems from the snowcover in the Plains, but most of it simply did not give the European enough credit for its SE rotation of a Canadian air mass. I do believe its transient though with some moderation in order by midweek and the five day numbers taken as a whole still are not that cold relative to normal. In many ways, this will be similar to what happened in late December with the largest departures from normal in the South. That will be due more from an active storm track rather than any real intrusion of arctic air. Speaking of south! ern storms, we see rain breaking out across much of Western and Northern Texas today. This system will bring rain to much of the old South the next couple of days. There is some potential for SE coastal development later in the week which could be a Mid-Atlantic snow. But, I am more bullish on the next system in the series which could be a big storm over the weekend. While its turning colder in the East, often times we see a reversal in the West. That does not appear to be the situation in this case. Cold air is trapped in much of the region and the upper level flow is not favorable to scour this out. A gradual moderation may occur, but it still looks below normal.       Tomorrow: Tuesday, February  5, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

The most extreme solution obviously would be a combination of the two, but that seems unlikely given the results of this winter so far. Of the two, I give the storm proposition the most weight. It is possible the East coast could see a sizeable snow out of all of this. As for the cold, the Canadian since the middle of last week has been rebuilding pressures in the NW territories. They become quite high this period, but are still North of the border. It once again becomes a wait and see game to see if some of this real arctic air can come down. That, I am not ready yet to commit to. However, the overall pattern certainly looks colder than January did and for many could run belo! w normal this period.

***********************************************************************

LOOKING FOR THE VALUE IN ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES

Corporate leaders often found it difficult to determine if environmental
strategies are paying off. As a broader set of corporate stakeholders
influences the shape of environmental strategy, corporate leaders regularly
encounter conflicting evaluations of their performance and frequently lack the
evidence to justify changes in strategy.

*  Increasing shareholder value is the ultimate success factor but corporations
cannot easily demonstrate a direct link between how an environmental strategy
is implemented and shareholder value.

*  Corporations are searching for proxy indicators that often blend the
quantitative and the intuitive from both internal and external sources.

*  Recognizing that a broader set of evaluation tools are required reduces the
frustration of searching for the perfect performance measure and, in the long
term, improves assessment efforts.

"EOL - Multiple Trading Books (URGENT)","Tim and John, I wanted to touch base with you regarding a problem that we have run into between EOL and a trader having multiple trading books. EOL has been set up to have a trader associated with one and only one trading book in the stack manager. As a result, when creating the interface between EOL and Enpower we can cannot assign multiple trading books to one person. David Poston in the Enpower IT support group in Houston has been working with the EOL group and has come up with a solution.

1. If you definitely plan to be trading on EOL for all trading books associated with your name, EOL IT can define certain products to each trading book. If this is the approach that you would like to take, I will need a list of what products you want to trade and to which trading book they are affiliated with. 

2. The other option is that you will just use one trading book under your name. If that is the case, no changes will have to be made.

If the plan is to use the first option, please let me know so we can make the changes and do the necessary testing on this.

John

"Are you a genius?","
[IMAGE] If you would like to be removed from our email list, please click or go to: http://www.questia.com/remove   and provide your email address.       [IMAGE]    Are you a genius?     Imagine having an IQ that's off the  charts -- a real superbrain! You wouldn't have to worry about grades because you'd ace every course.  As a matter of fact, you'd probably be teaching classes instead of attending them. But how would you  fit in at school or with your friends? Oftentimes, people with exceptional intelligence struggle to  be accepted and understood because of their nontraditional thinking. Nobel Prize winner, John Nash,  whose life is portrayed in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind,"" is a good example of how challenging the  life of a genius can be.  Here at Questia,  we decided to take a look in our collection to understand the phenomena called genius.    [IMAGE]   After you've taken a look at the books below, feel free to explore our topics  to find your favorite subject.  And be sure to take our free test drive.        The World's Largest Online Library of Books   with content not found anywhere else on the Internet      Origins of Genius: Darwinian Perspectives on Creativity   by Dean Keith Simonton   Creativity and the Mind: Discovering the Genius Within   by Thomas B. Ward, Ronald A. Finke, and Steven M. Smith   The Road to Excellence: The Acquisition of Expert Performance in the Arts and Sciences, Sports, and Games   by K. Anders Ericsson   Who Got Einstein's Office?:  Eccentricity and Genius at the Institute for Advanced Study   by Ed Regis   Creativity and Disease: How Illness Affects Literature, Art, and Music   by Philip Sandblom   Explore Questia's 70,000 + books and journal articles      Ensure success Brain power  Sometimes success isn't always about brain power -- unless of course you really do  have a raging IQ! But there is something you can do to help guarantee your success this  semester -- subscribe to  Questia.    Why subscribe?  Think about the price tag of just getting into school -- tuition, books, etc. You've made  a huge investment, but getting into school doesn't guarantee academic success. Questia, on the other hand, at  a much more affordable price tag  actually  will help you achieve success. So really, the only question is why wouldn't you subscribe?   The price of a book  Questia gives you a library in your room that's  available around the clock -- 24/7.    And you won't find our exclusive collection anywhere else on the Internet.  Who knows, maybe Questia will help raise your IQ a few points.   Wishing you success, The Questia Team      (c)2002 Questia Media America, Inc.

Stephane Brodeur should be removed from the list.
I am not sure about Chris Lambie, whether he is joining the company.
Garrett Trip should be added as the Ontario Power trader (that market won't open until May 2002)

Pattern developing as advertised, but will the cold air materialize?  The Southern stream storm track is alive and well and should continue to be so for the next couple of weeks. All of the models point to the potential of healthy winter storms in the midst of a warmer than normal temperature pattern. The lack of realized cold continues to frustrate me as once again the air simply is not that frigid. We are still below normal relative to normal over much of the South and West. In the West, it is due to high pressure trapped in the Intermountain region while in the South it is in response to inclement weather along the storm track. The North and East are back into a warming mode in spite of the fact that a trough will reform in the East. Upstream over the Western h! alf of Canada, it is just not that cold anymore. The MRF is up to its old tricks of a sharp cooling ""just past this period"" and the Canadian still insists on a moderate intensity high coming down this weekend. It may well turn cooler, but certainly not in an excessive way. The five day numbers will be warming, not cooling.     Tomorrow: Thursday, February  7, 2002   Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.

We are rapidly running out of time for that as normal temperatures are now on their way up. We may not see anything extreme, but I still see some potential for the East being slightly below normal for the period if the Canadian is on the right track. The models do seem to show ridging to continue out West. It has been a very slow process, but moderation should continue.

A very active Southern jet stream could spin up two more significant winter storms through next weekend.  From the looks of the models today, the pattern is about as active as it gets. Imagine the possibilities if only there was more cold air in the mix. While brutal air is still not expected, the potential for winter farther South is on the increase next week. We will see a temporary break from the storminess over the weekend. The current storm now in Pennsylvania will move out to sea and drive colder air into the region. A cool and dry weekend seems to be shaping up for most areas, but a weak low will drop out of Canada, across the Lakes and toward New England on Sund! ay. The current storm will probably drive out most of the available moisture, but some lake effect is possible so some light snow amounts should occur. The next Pacific wave comes ashore in a fairly harmless fashion initially. However, the set up looks favorable for some sort of Low pressure to develop in the vicinity of the Gulf coast early next week. It would head toward the SE US and could be an interesting factor. As far as temperatures go, the high pressure over the Western Plateau (Colorado and Utah) is keeping that region in a trapped cold air mass. The Plains will slowly modify from the current shallow arctic air in place while the East undergoes a rather pronounced cooling to near if not slightly below normal levels, a far cry from the record highs of the past two weeks.

I still dont see us bringing in any real brutal arctic air, but the SE ridge that has been in place for much of January is no more. In all cases, the models suppress the storm track to the Southern U.S. which opens the door to another potentially major winter storm, but quite a bit farther South than the last one. The solutions are all over the place which one would expect this far out. One aspect that struck me as noteworthy was the Canadian's depiction of a large arctic high over the Northern U.S. It has had it for three runs in a row, but given the high surface pressures does not look as cold as I would have expected. It's just another product of a strange winter I suspect. So, while I still am not in any kind of arctic camp on this, I do be! lieve the areas of above normal temperatures will be very limited. I look for most areas to run near or slightly below normal.    Day 6: Wednesday, February  6, 2002  Click Here  for Syncrasy's 6-10 summary information.  Syncrasy's Choice:  Delta Temp.
