To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Roger Steiner

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Kevin Vaughn

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

David Cantor

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Julia Pais

PHONY STIMULUS PACKAGE WON'T FIX THE ECONOMY

""Although understandably preoccupied with the war on terrorism, the
Bush administration needs to give some leadership to the economy.
This means recognizing its own mistakes,"" writes Independent
Institute research fellow Paul Craig Roberts, in a recent syndicated
column.

For starters, Bush should recognize that his tax cuts -- which are
phased-in and temporary rather than immediate and permanent -- will
do little to stimulate investment. Furthermore, the pork-barrel
spending package ""is not a stimulus; it simply crowds out an
equivalent amount of private spending and prevents resources from
being used more productively,"" writes Roberts.

As Roberts says, the so-called ""stimulus"" package ignores the lessons
for stimulating long-term growth taught by supply-side economics
twenty years ago.

""The solution to the economy's problems is obvious and simple,""
Roberts argues. ""Effective immediately, abolish the alternative
minimum tax, accelerate depreciation on a permanent basis and cut tax
rates on personal income.""

Really Happened in 1981,"" by Alan Reynolds and Paul Craig Roberts

-------------------------------------------------------------

CRISIS AND RATCHETING UP GOVERNMENT GROWTH

The wasteful pork in the recent spending package, and the dubious new
anti-privacy powers of the federal government, illustrate clearly how
government grows during national crises. Less obvious, however, is
the fact that when the emergencies subside, the new programs are
seldom dissolved. Often they are transformed into new programs or
agencies with new missions, ratcheting up government's growth.

The International Monetary Fund is one of thousands of examples that
could illuminate this government pathology, explain Independent
Institute research fellow Steve Hanke and senior fellow Robert Higgs
in a new op-ed for the FINANCIAL TIMES.

Formed in 1944 as part of the Bretton Woods agreement, the IMF was
intended to stabilize the global financial system -- by providing
credit to countries experiencing balance-of-payments problems under
the postwar pegged-exchange-rate system. But when President Nixon
closed the U.S. gold window in 1971 -- effectively ending the Bretton
Woods agreement -- the IMF became a multi-million dollar agency in
search of a new mission.

It soon found one. The IMF reinvented itself during the oil shocks of
the 1970s, and in the 1980s, with President Reagan's seal of
approval, by subsidizing loans to developing countries.

Today, the IMF is contemplating ways to financially assist coalition
partners in the War against Terrorism and to deny funds to
less-than-cooperative countries.

Government programs and institutions aren't the only things that get
ratcheted-up during national crises.

""The ratchet continues to operate on ideology, too,"" write Hanke and
Higgs. ""A recent poll conducted by THE WASHINGTON POST indicates that
53 percent of Americans think the government 'is run for the benefit
of all the people,' up from 35 percent last year. Only 37 percent
agreed that 'the government is pretty much run by a few big interests
looking out for themselves,' the lowest percentage since 1966, when
33 percent embraced that view.

""It may be too much to expect a speedy end to the law of the ratchet,
but it is time to acknowledge what is going on. That, at least, may
make it easier to reverse the trend during times of stability.""

-------------------------------------------------------------

DE-POLITICIZING THE FINAL CHOICE

One of the most dramatic battles between federal and state
governments -- and a painful illustration of how drug prohibition
cripples human dignity -- is brewing in Oregon, where a federal judge
recently issued a court order to block U.S. Attorney General John
Ashcroft from interfering with the state's physician-assisted suicide
law.

(Declaring that physician-assisted suicide ""was not a legitimate
medical purpose for prescribing drugs,"" Ashcroft -- who earier had
promised to uphold federalism over federal encroachment upon the
states -- had threatened to have the medical licenses of
participating doctors revoked.)

Many civil libertarians, understandably, see Ashcroft's threat as a
direct assault on human dignity in a matter too private and sensitive
to allow government interference between doctor and patient.

However, according to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz (member, Independent
Institute Board of Advisors), the fundamental problem is that our
laws make it unlawful to use lethal drugs to commit suicide --
except, as in the case of Oregon, when it is physician-assisted, and
even then only under limited circumstances.

In other words, no matter how painfully one may suffer from a
terminal illness, one's ultimate choice must be prescribed by a
physician.

Undoubtedly, this needlessly prolongs the suffering and anguish of
those law-abiding sufferers who decide that waiting for nature to
take its course is too long and too painful.

Drug and suicide law reform, however, would help restore genuine
dignity to those suffering from unspeakable pain. ""Physician-assisted
suicide,"" writes Szasz in a new op-ed, ""is but one of the
consequences of our drug laws.""

By expanding their range of lawful options, drug and suicide law
reform would enable the terminally ill to take matters lawfully into
their own hands without interference from the state. It would also
help lift the burden from physicians struggling to interpret the
Hippocratic Oath.

""The American people are ceaselessly propagandized about the real
dangers from which drug prohibitions are intended to protect us,""
Szasz concludes. ""The damage the prohibitions cause are glossed over
in silence or, more often, are unrecognized. We avoid confronting
problems of living as moral problems and choose instead to treat them
as medical problems. It is not a good choice.""

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Emilie Jones

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Stanley Messer

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

tina horowitz

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Aileen Murphy

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company declared
bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and
REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their
retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in
California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron
and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California
consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company
declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.
And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California
energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of
consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the
largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of
Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to
keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to
help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's
underhanded dealin

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I am personally disgusted by your willingness to profit from such immoral business practices.  As an actor in California, who typically earns less than $7,000 a year from my craft, I was personally affected by the major increase in energy costs last year.  And I am infuriated that I had to skip meals to pay my energy bill while you personally cleared over a million dollars.  I hope you spent a substantial part of your earnings supporting the arts in your local community, donating to public libraries, funding a scholarship program for low-income students in impoverished neighborhoods, or in some other way improving our community.

In case you were too selfish to consider building your community with your profits, I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.

Who needs $100 million dollars?  Forbes ran a series a few years back about people who'd made millions, but lived quiet lives and donated substantial chunks of their money to charitable causes.  Remember Rockefeller, the Morgans, the millionaires of the early 20th century?  They built their community, recognizing that they benefited from a well-fed, better-educated populace.  Too bad the millionaires of today don't share their commitment.  We have a lot of people who could use a helping hand every now and then.

Sincerely,

J. Harrison

On a personal note, my mother, who is a 61-year-old widowed public schoolteacher, has lost more than $50,000 of her net worth left to her in Enron stock at her father's and husband's deaths. I realize that $50,000 is a mere pittance to those in your position, but I can assure you that the comfort and security of my mother's remaining years will be markedly diminished by a loss of this magnitude, one that few women in her position could absorb.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Shame on you for ignoring the problems in your company for so long and allowing thousands to lose their life savings.  There's nothing you can say in defense of your actions that will justify what happened.

Sincerely,

Peggy La Point

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

16 S. New Street
West Chester, PA 19382
graverj@mail.rfweston.com

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jeff Graver

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Anita Buchanan-Jones

And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Maria Flumiani

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

elizabeth gill

Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Lee Gibson

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Richard Tiedemann

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,
Laura Parker

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Gary Bowers

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Edward Melendez

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company declared
bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and
REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their
retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in
California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron
and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California
consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company
declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.
And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California
energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of
consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the
largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of
Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to
keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to
help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's
underhanded dealin

To Mr. Ken Lay,

In the interest of saving your own soul (not to mention the ability to sleep at night) I urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock to such funds as the Enron Employee Transition Fund.  I recommend that you encourage your fellow executives to do the same.  Whether you are religious or not, karma is a very real force in this universe.   God or no god, your actions will have consequences for both you and the nation for decades into the future. The world, and possibly the afterworld, demand your repentence.  Do you really want to go to Hell?

If there is a shred of honor in your life, you will make amends for selling $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

You're a smart man and you can still make other millions to fund your retirement.

Sincerely,

Gordon Wiltsie

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

cynthia rutherford

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Linda Younker

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Dean Muesing

millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Ross Jonak

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Katherine Coventry

Think about this equation: Power (money) = Responsibility.
If you put yourself in a position to reap the benefits of others
for your own gain you owe the others responible actions in
their behalf. If you fail to do this, you should pay a retribution
of at least equal value than what you declared your personal

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. You own millions of dollars worth of property in various places around the country, yet you have the audacity to allow your wife to plead to the media that you are ""broke."" Please.

It is your obligation to donate the money you made off your employees to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Kaye Schwartz

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Steve Surasky

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

I invested in your company because I believed in Enron and its financial statements. I am NOT seeking to recover my lost investment, but I do believe that your employees deserve much after their years of hard work making Enron and you rich.
I know you will never read this email and couldn't be bothered with it, but unless you are willing to have your name go down in American history as one of its worse business criminals, you have a chance now to right an egregious wrong.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Rebecca Long

Furthermore, for your wife to appear on the Today Show and state that the house you live in is your only asset is not only a total lie, but also an added insult to the intelligence of the American citizens.  You are the evil, greedy ones.  I hope your ill-gotten gains do not serve you in any good way.  And to think that you would be getting a severance package as well -- this is all too ludicrous to believe.  Do the right thing for once and donate all your assets (other than the house you live in!!) to your employees so that they can get on with their lives and their retirement.

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Laura Yow

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jolene Skinner

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I believe it is your duty to to donate the millions of dollars you made from Enron stock before the bankruptcy to funds that assist former Enron employees who were so badly hit from this financial fiasco, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH. These funds also provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.

It is now known that you personally gained $100 million off of Enron stock, while many Enron employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy.  Enron also profited from the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, thousands of consumers are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the employees to buy it.  You must know, in your heart, that this is truly unfair, unjust and unethical.  But there is something you can do to help make things right: please donate this money to funds set up to help repair the lives of Americans hurt by Enron's misdeeds.  I think it's the least you can do.

Thanks for your time.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Jennifer Vondrak

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Anne Brown

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to balance the books!!  Your employees brought success to your company, but lost their profit!  Im' urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  I read about your involvement with Dr. Cheney, Prez Bush... and the whole energy/oil cartel.  This request is about the people that helped you get there!!  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Blanca Anderson

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Alicia Power
